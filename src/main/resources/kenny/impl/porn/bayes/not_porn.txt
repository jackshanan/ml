Awesome irons for low handicap players. very smooth feel.
I have been a long time blade player but this new club by Callaway has a great feel, sets up nice and the look at address is special.  They have a solid feel and with the Project X shaft just a perfect combination.  Also the soft steel allows for easy loft and lie adjustments to make them feet like a glove.....
Glad that Dick's carries the Ping drivers. Good value and good purchasing experience.
Love the Driver! I got to hit a few different drivers in the simulator and this one was a perfect fit!
This is the best club in my bag!

                            The Dick's ordering was great!

                            I think Ping really has a good read on this club.
I updated a 10+ yr old driver that I could not get any loft with (or hit straight).  This was my first large volume driver.  I tried several in the store and this one had the best feel, most consistent trajectory and was on sale.  After a few quick adjustments at the range I was hitting the ball with a good trajectory about 225-250 yes without much effort and if I maintained some basic discipline with my swing hit it very straight.  I love this club, has improved my game tremendously.
Very happy with this driver.  Feels much more solid than the R11.
It is what I expected and recommended by your Cranberry store Golf Pro
Thsi is the best driver made. I have all Callaway in my bag with this driver being the only exception. I demoed this club at my country club and I had actually had two drivers in my bag that day (The G20 and Callaway Razor Fit), I played the Callaway on the front nine and the G20 on the back nine and the G20 blew the Callaway out of the water. It gave me 10-20 more yards and it was straight as an arrow. By the 12th hole, I hade the confidence that I didn't have before to go over lakes, trees and cut dog legs and this was a course that I know very well. This is a great driver and well worth the [$].
No bling, no bolts or screws and no funky paint.  Just straight and long.  I put my Taylormade in my spare club bag.
my fairways hit is increasing every week.  I can swing hard and not worry about bad direction. I have actually developed a leg drive because i am not afraid to rip it.
I wish I would have taken the time to have the driver Measured to my stride/stance.  I bought it over the internet.
I hit this club on every par 4 and 5 with no fear of out of play. First cut of rough is as bad as it gets. It's so easy to hit you could wear a blindfold.  10 yards longer than my old G15 and I thought noone could make a driver better than than that one.
I will use this product when I drive off the tee.

                            The 10.5 seems to benifit me well and I hit the ball off the drive further.

                            Good driver, thanks Dick's Sporting Good and Ping.
6 handicap, this driver is amazing, worth the money. ive had all the taylormade drivers prety much. (all the r series, superfast, etc.) and this tops all of them.
After playing with Square 2's for many years I decided it was time to take it up a notch.  I went back and forth between TaylorMade &amp; Calloway and opted for the Taylormade Burners 2.0 irons and woods.


                            It was a very good decision.  I dropped down a club length almost immediately.  The feel great and are very forgiving.  I would highly recommend these clubs to anyone interested in stepping up their game.
Started playing again after 3 year layoff. Did an experiment to see if new clubs are better. Played 20 rounds with my old clubs (Wilson Fat Shafts and Silver Scots) when I started back. Got handicap down to 8. Bought these clubs and played 20 more rounds (I retired last May so have time). Handicap still 8. Bottom line-you still must practice putting and chipping. There is no magic in any set of clubs. Distance may be 5 yards farther per club but that may be due to longer shafts on these and stronger lofts. Next move-buy a driver to see if that helps. Trade in at Dick's was awesome! Walked out with these only [$] lighter in pocketbook.
I bought the irons for my husband...he loves them.
I've owned the 2.0's since March of 2011 and have had the greatest summer playing golf in a long time. If the price scares you don't let it it is the best amount of money I've spent for golf. The last set of clubs I owned for 9 years and knew exactly how long and what I could do with them these in 2 rounds I was doing that and hitting the ball further and sticking more greens then ever! Can't say enough about the Burner 2.0 Irons other then all the club makers had better wise up their being left behind!
Bought this set of irons for my grandson's 14th birthday,August 14,2011.  The FIRST time out at Lincoln Golf Club in Muskegon MI, he had a hole in one!!  Last Saturday, he had another hole in one while golfing with his proud Dad.  Needless to say, he loves his clubs!!!
These are great clubs, soft feel, achieve spin, all around game improver. Definatly compensate for bad shots
i bought the 4-aw steel set about a month ago and i have played 6 rounds with them. these clubs are amazing!!! they have truely improved my iron game.  these clubs are easy to swing and easy to hit straight. i previously owned the callaway x-12 steel heads. i have seen a huge improvement on my GIR's and have cut about 8 strokes on average so far. Cant go wrong buying these clubs
These clubs feel so pure, I was blown away by how smooth the ball comes off the face. For being a "game improvement" iron, I was very surprised how easily I was able to draw the ball when I tried and also how well my approach shots checked up and spun back to the hole. I love the look of these clubs as well, they look more like blades at address, which makes you feel very confident and comfortable over the ball. I would strongly recommend these irons if your're looking to improve your game!!
These irons have an amazing feel. I had the taylor made rac's prior to these which were nice irons, but these 2.0 irons are amazing. Not only did I gain around 10 yards per club, but the ball comes off so smooth and effortless. These are way more forgiving than any irons I've played with.
This club isnt near as good as they make it sound. Don't believe all the hype about the AMAZING distance, its just normal. I hit these with a couple other sets and they were no better than the old burners they just look different.


                            Waste of money
This club is longer and feel better than my ping i20 nice trajectory taylormade hit a homerun on r11 irons.
Weighted good, looks good, good feel. Just feels good when you grab a club. Added 5 to 8 yards distance vs old DCI irons.
I play about 3 times a week, I am a 8 hdcp have been playing for 25 years. I am the pickest of all my friends about irons. I have played only three sets in 25 years, Calloway and Ping (most recently). The new R11's are the best irons by far great distance and super feel, I can work the ball left or right pretty easy with these clubs, high or low shots not a problem. This is the first ever review of any kind for me becasue this is a great club IMHO, I don't think this club is for the high handicapper as it is not as forgiving as some other models out there, but if you are a player this is it.  Golfing in Mississippi.
I carry an 11 handicap, and for about 2 years I have been trying to get into single digits.  I traded in my Titelist DCI's for the R11's, and immediately am seeing better scores.  I read that a lot of people are gaining distance, which isn't that important to me, and honestly I haven't had a whole lot of change in my distances.  What I am finding is the number of shots that are pure and solid have doubled in a round for me.  The look of the club gives me confidence because they still look like a blade, or at least much more than a Ping G20 does, and I still get some help from the club on mis-hits that a blade iron doesn't offer. The price is high, but if you can afford them, I hightly recommend these.
I bought these clubs about 3 months ago and absolutely fell in love with them...when you hit the ball with this club it just launches off the face and flies straight...if you can afford these clubs BUY THEM!!
The clubs work great and added atleast 10 yards to my game. Only problem is a friend of mine has the burner 2.0 irons and I hit them almost the exact same. In my opinoin the Burner 2.0 is more accurate and a better buy!
The feel and sound flow with each other. I wont swing anything but a Taylormade after these. If you can afford em there great clubs. They added 10-15 yards to my game wich in turn shaved srokes.
I was fitted by the golf professional at Dicks, big mistake. I'm 65 I was put in std lie and lenght in a stiff steel shaft. I lost 15 to 20 yds per club. After my purchase I found out all they had in stock was the stiff shaft, isn't that special.

                            Went to Taylormade clinic was refitted to 3/4" longer 1 degree up and reg flex graphite. After I had clubs reshafted and adjusted I love them, 1/2 club longer than my R9's and easier to work the ball.
I play 2 or 3 times a week, and these irons have really in increased my confidence when standing over the ball. They have the look of a blade iron, with the forgiveness of a game improvement iron. This is the best set of irons I have ever played and I highly recommend them for anyone looking to improve their game.
Went from a Graghite set of R9's reg flex, To the R11's in KBS steel in stiff flex. I noticed an immediate improvement in ball flight, my ball flight is slight lower and about a half club longer. Great feel and very accurate. 3and 4 irons are very easy to hit. Straight is the prefered line, left to right is easy, right to left can be done but not quite as easy.
Bought these clubs a couple months ago and have played about two rounds per week with them.  Overall I'm very happy with the purchase.  You're not going to get huge distance gains or a very forgiving set if you buy these, but they're very consistent and accurate.  And that extra muscle cavity adds a bit of forgiveness, so if you hit one off the toe or heal it won't be a complete shank and instead you'll just lose some yardage.  Plus they look great at address which is a huge bonus.  Overall a great set of clubs.  I'd recommend these to anyone who is confident in their game or looking to pick up a set of players irons to grow into without getting a true blade set.


                            The only downside is the color scheme isn't quite as pretty as some other irons out there.  That's why they're only 4 stars :)
I have played four rounds with the new irons.  I hit them longer and straighter than the Cobras I previously owned.
I have played with many diferent irons and the 2.0's was the best irons and drivers i have ever played with and i will continue to play with these for many year to come highly recomended....
Since my purchase of my Taylor Made Burner 2.0 irons my hadicap dropped 4. These irons put the wow factor back into my game.

There is no question that these irons go at least 10 yards further than the Burner Irons I had for a few years. They are also a very nice looking club, I could have gotten the Rocketballz irons for the same price but the feedback I was getting was that these irons were performing about the same.I am very pleased with this purchase.
GAINED 12 YARDS PER IRON AND OH SO STRIGHT NO DRAW OR FADE
Used Dick's club fitting to customize clubs - changed to stiff shafts, added inch to length adjusted lie angle and went to mid-sized grips.  It took over a month to adjust to all the changes. Now I love the clubs.  Added 10 yards/club plus improved spin/control.  Everything is going dead straignt now.  I've dropped 4-5 strokes off handicap.  Looking at going back to be fitted for a driver. Combination of discounts and trade had me out the door for just over $400.
Playing golf 3-4 times a week.
Bought these for my boyfriend as his previous set of clubs was over 15 years old. He is a tall man at 6'4" and he found these clubs to be very accomodating for his height. He has played several games since the purchase and he easily adapted his swing to the new feel and function of these irons.
Very forgiving clubs and when you hit the ball correctly...it will fly straight and long.
changed from graphite shafts to steel shafts with no trouble--have average about 7 more yards with these new irons
All I can say is WOWZERS!!!! I was hitting the 4 Iron 240-245 yards. If your looking for maximum distance do yourself a favor and pick up these clubs.
These irons are much more balanced and have a sweet spot even I can't miss with.  I use to have problems with the length of the club, but they have added some extra lengthover my old irons and they swing great.
casual golfer
got as a gift this year. started playing last year with a friend that has played for yesrs, he gave me a set to use but i wanted my own. had started reading up on the latest equipment and wanted these the first time i saw them. well fast forward to friday july 6th 2012, went out with my buddy for a round and on the first hole of a par 4( 368 i think) after my tee shot that went right, my second shot was about 165 yrds from the green, i pulled my 7 iron out and hit the perfect shot a eagle on the hardest hole on the course, i know you have to do the things to make that happen but having the right equipment makes all the difference. BEEN SMILING AND BRAGGING, LOL. TAYLORMADE FOR LIFE. IF YOU GET THESE MAKE SURE YOU GET FITTED THE GUYS AT DICKS ARE GREAT AND VERY HELPFUL AND THEY KNOW THEIR STUFF. THANKS GUYS.
It would have been better if the 5 iron was a hybrid too. Just like Adams. But all in all these irons are great and easy to play with and forgiving too.
Bought this set a month ago and very glad I did! I am a beginner and still learning the game, but I will have these clubs for life. The ball just rockets off the irons when struct correct and the hybrids are very long and straight.
The irons are stronger by a full club, I had a 183 yards across water to the green normally I have to kill a 5 iron. I swing smooth with a 6 iron...flushed it one hop and I am putting for eagle...I 3 putted for par...but I had a 12 foot putt for eagle for me that's Golf.
Recently purchased this set (stiff flex) and was going back and forth on whether to er the hybrids or not.  Very glad I did!  That 3 is so responsive off the fairway and it seems to go straight where I aim most every time.  I was trying to wait out the price, but needed clubs badly and thought it would be worth it to take the plunge.  I did hit a couple 5 and 7 iron shots near the heel area of the club, but they still at least flew straight, just not very far.  Overall, I am very pleased with this set of clubs and will be looking forward to watching my game improve.  Pretty sure my score will be sub-100 a bit more consistently now!!
These clubs will change your game.  Very forgiving and extremely long. I have gained at least 10 yards with every club and 15 with some!  I had a set of Calloway x20' s which I loved but the feel and distance I'm getting with these clubs have made me forget about those  callaways.
it came down to length of shaft between the Callaways Razor HL or the Taylor 2.0- This club is extremely forgiving and I needed that because I am a new golfer. I am now a Taylor Made man for life. The Callaways are also good but if you need a little more length you will get that standard on the TM. You will have to add it to the Callaway's. I only wish I would have bought the Stiff Flex, The Hybrids are a little to Flexy for me,  The 3H &amp; 4H clubs are hard to get used to. It will take a while to get used to them but overall these clubs are outstanding.
i felt like a pro the feeling i got from these clubs was like non other and i could control it very well too i think these are the best clubs in the world right know.
went from Ping to the tailormade set.  Love the 3/4 hyb's and I am working on learning to use the irons.  Shafts are a little bit longer then the standard.  When you hit it correctly it's great.   When you hit it off the center it lets you know.
I ordered a graphite 3-4H, and 5-PW with graphite shafts.  After waiting a week they sent a set of steel shaft Irons.  Now I have to make another trip to the store to return and change the order.  The sales man in the store seamed confused, now I know why.
the product is super,,more feel,,more distance,less vibration,,will take more play to get use of 3 and 4 hybrid,,but hitting them a ton,,just need to figure out set-up positions
The clubs are great.  Only played with them twice, but they have a nice feel and great weight and hit long and straight.

                            The problem is, the set includes not a 3H &amp; 4H as advertised, but a 4H &amp;5H and 6-A.
I'm a long-term mediocre golfer who has always used hand-me-down clubs.  I treated myself to the Burner, and I am finding myself much happier on the golf course!  The driver is very forgiving, and my distance is much improved.  It didn't turn me into a great golfer, but it helped me enjoy my game more.  The delivery was REALLY fast!  Count me satisfied.
Got this club for my wife very pleased with club she has more confidence not than any other club she has had previously.
Shawn was most helpful with this purchase - tested several clubs but this one took the prize.  Most happy with the results, longer drives and more distance each time on the links
I finally got out on the course with this new driver and was I surprised!  My tee shots were finally accelerating like you see on TV when watching the pros -- I was getting 50 yards more on each shot, and, I got the excitement of making a par on a longer par 3 hole that I could never get to before!  I love this club!!
I have been using the driver this past week, and I am happy to have purchased it.  The associate in the golf department at Dicks, Dave, was extremely helpful in making the choice
Bought this driver as a replacement for a older Calaway.  The club was on sale as the new line had just come out.  For about $120 you can get this great driver.  Hurry before they all see out.  It is a great deal!!
use it to play in my golf league to help my game
It was time to upgrade from the driver that came with my set of clubs too many years ago.  The club is powerful, but on my first use I did have some trouble getting the ball up in the air.  I also looked at the Callaway driver, which the sales rep  said would help with loft.
It has improved my distance.
This club took my game to another level.  As a woman distance is important and this club gave me just the amount I needed to be able to compete.
Ideal irons for average to good golfers. Nice to be able to hit them before you buy them
Let me start off by saying that these are fantastic irons, and I have gained distance. I was long to begin with, so I was more interested in the forgiveness of the irons. I have had to adjust since I had my old irons for over 10 years and you get used to a certain feel over time. That said, when I hit it true, these feel smooth as silk and are forgiving. I hit balls that would have sliced off with my old clubs, but seemed to fight to stay straight with these. I  am very happy with the overall purchase and would recommend them to a friend.
My Boyfriend says these are the best clubs he's ever played with!  He's been playing Golf for about 15yrs, and Loves Loves Loves Them! :)
I had been using an old but great set of Ping Eye 2's for 10 years.  I finally decided to buy a new set of irons.  After hitting these at a practice facility I knew they were the right choice.  I hit the RBZ's anywhere 15-30 yards further for each club.  I used to hit a 5 iron about 170 yards.  Now I can consistently hit 190-200 with a full swing.


                            Off the fairway they are amazing.  The 4 and 5 are more like hybrids and I have yet to master them from heavy rough, but with the extra distance I can typically make due with shorter club.


                            They are very forigiving and have given me the ability and confidence to club up and take shorter swings to work the ball into tough pins.
I have been able to hit these much longer and straighter than my old Hogan Edge clubs.  My five iron was going about 185 yards, now it is about 205 yards.  WOW.  The club shafts are a bit longer than other clubs I tested which allows for more club head speed, but may sacrifice some accuracy.  The top-line is pretty thick which doesn't look too great, but frankly, I would rather have clubs that lower my score than ones that simply score style points.  I would also point out that the clubhead is a bit heavier than the average iron, so be sure you like the way it feels before you buy.  Lastly, if you are used to 25 year old clubs like mine that were similar to today's "tour" models, you will notice that these clubs induce a small draw, which is really nice!  Other clubs like the Callaways tend to have a much larger offset which results in a full-fledged hook if you typically hit the ball fairly straight like me.
The staff was very helpful, and the clubs are fantastic. Very accurate, but don't seem to hit as far as my previous irons. Moving up one club does the trick.
Keeps the ball flight online with the target
my 5 iron I used to hit 175 now with these around 200 yards. I absolutely love these.
had these clubs three weeks, GREAT improvement my first round, easy to hit....
I haven't played enough rounds yet to give a total review, but so far they seem to be consistant in distance, between 1/2 to 1 club longer, and help to hit accurate shots. They have a high ball flight, which should help to hold gteens.

                            So far, so good!
great feel and so much more distance.great club
each club is longer and easy to hit
I use these Taylor Made Rocketballz on the golf course. These irons are so easy to hit and also get more distance from them. Cant say whats not so great about them.
I used to hit a 6 iron at 150 now I hit a 7 or even a 8 I love these clubs
I started playing again in 2010 because my wife wanted to play.  I played on/off for 20 years and am a high handicapper.  I use to enjoy the game but not passionate about it like my wife.  Bought Callaway Big Bertha Graphites in 2010 and did okay.  Traded these at Dick's for the Taylormade RocketBallz and what a difference!  I'm still not as good as my wife but I now look forward to playing 18 every weekend.  The clubs are as advertised.  They are very forgiving.  I'm 64 and bought the steel shafts.  I never played this well before.  Great clubs!  I also have to add that the folks in the Golf Dept at Dick's in Pineville,NC are great.  Especially Mike and Rich.
I switched from an old set of Callaway irons to these new TaylorMade RBZ irons and hybrids and the difference was noticed immediately. The clubs seem easier to hit and the contact is better with every strike giving me a few more yards with each club. And the hybrids, definitely a step up from any of the hybrids on the market right now. Great feel, added distance and improved accuracy.
I was told that you could not get 4h and 5h with the irons without buying a 5h, which is what I did. Then I find out that I could order the irons that way 4h-5h 6 iron thru AW. I am not happy at all. I was lied to just to make a sale, and I am stuck with aa 3h which I did not want.
I've been a solid believer in the hybrid sets for several years as I can't hit a 3 or 4 iron to save my life. I'm literally hitting one club length longer than my previous clubs. The face is extremely forgiving and has great feel. The hybrid clubs give me more options on long par 4's and par 5's. I'm extremely happy with this purchase. Only con is the grips. I live/play in AZ and the stock Taylormade grips don't play well in hot weather.
Played with them for two weeks now. Very solid feeling and sounding, never get a vibration. I have gained about 5-6 yards from 9-7 irons, 5 &amp; 6 maybe a copule more but easy to hit. I have the 3 &amp; 4 hybrids with my set, very nice but still getting used to them. Very accurate!
actually get a better feel and distance even as a high handicapper.
Love the feel, got greater distance,well balanced clubs.Dick's online made it easy shopping.
Returned this item; didn't get what was advertised on the internet.
I've gone from being a 6 handicap in my younger days to a 15 in my fifties. These clubs are forgiving, but don't have the lifelessness of a typical cavity back. I've played three rounds with them and can't say enough good about them. Definitely buy the Satin shafts and I ordered oversized grips which seem to allow me to keep a more solid feel through impact.
Amazing ball trajectory and distance with a great soft feel.  I will use these far into the future
This ball does everything at a low cost
Similar to hitting stones with expensive irons. Off the tee they are good, but no feel around the greens.
good distance happy with ball
Total distance about the same. Gets great roll both in fairway and on the green. Prefer a ball with more bite on the green. Probably wont use this product again.
I am a Bridgestone Golf guy and love their products.  The sales associate told me that I should try this ball.  I like it for pure distance, but not a great all around ball.  Would be a good tee ball in a scramble tournament
This ball has given me 15+ extra yards on my drives and 10+ yards on irons. It sounds great off the clubs and lands softly on greens.

                            I used one ball for 54-holes without any noticible loss of distance. My handicap dropped 2-strokes, I play the same way so it had to be the ball that did it. Thanks Rocketballz!
Great disance and feel around the greens
Started using these instead of the Callaway HX Hot's and found them to be very similar.  Like the double numbers too.
This ball was as long off the tee as the PENTA TP5 and Stopped on the Greens the ROCKETBALLZ are now in my Bag with the PENTA TP5.
These head covers do the job protecting my irons from clanging together while traveling or on the cart during a round!
Purchased to protect clubs while traveling. They do that job well. Would be nice to be able to buy extras in two or three packs for additional wedges in bag. Overall look nice and work well.
Looks good, works better
The product does not distinguish the difference between a 6 iron cover or a 9 iron cover .. Also , there should be a way to purchase a set of 3 iron covers specifically for wedges .. Calloway went for the sale instead of truly satisfying the customer..Competitors do a better job of making the product customer friendly
The construction is very good. They look great. The black/red ones really stand out and match my Callaway stand bag perfectly. Easy to put on and take off.
Awesome irons for low handicap players. very smooth feel.
I have been a long time blade player but this new club by Callaway has a great feel, sets up nice and the look at address is special.  They have a solid feel and with the Project X shaft just a perfect combination.  Also the soft steel allows for easy loft and lie adjustments to make them feet like a glove.....
I had the Callaway Big Bertha, then got the Diablo which I enjoyed very much.. Great Clubs! Then I wanted the next best thing and got the Octane and now trying to get rid of it.. The head is heavier, the grip is thicker, the shaft is longer, so all in all you really have to train with it and adjust.. The overall feel is just not the same and one should not have to adjust ones swing.. Just saying.
i like it b/c feel so good
I picked up this club and I love it.  I've hit it before and the feel of it is fantastic and I feel as if my swing has improved, which in turn has added a few yards to my game.  I'm just an average golfer, and would definitely recommend it to anyone.
There is a very nice feel to this it is outstanding! i can already see the difference in my drives. its hitting 15-20 yards longer! I love it
Got this driver as soon as it hit the shelves and I have not been disappointed! Forgiving and longer than my a driver purchased last spring from another manufacture. I love the very traditional look as well.
Easy to adjust and easy to hit
I needed to replace my driver, getting old does that to you. I bought this club after testing everything Dick's had in stock. Love the feel, the grip and the extra distance I am getting. The adjustability sealed the deal. After my first outing my brother went out that same day and bought this club. He hadn't used a driver all year.
I used to slice HUGE before I got this driver. I hit some straight out of the box, made the necessary adjustments, and I was hitting them to the back of the range. Awesome driver and would recommend to anybody!
Callaway's stiff shafts are not stiff at all, after getting them tested at dicks SG my stiff shaft was actually a regular shaft. My swing speed is to fast for the shaft they have on there ( RIP'd) so I have to have a different shaft put on it. Not happy at all
Help out my swing alot
This club is definitly longer off the T by at least fifteen yards. Only negative is, if you slice, hook, pull or push you have an accented miss hit.  Very hard to control the club. It's hotter off the sweet spot than most drivers are on sweet spot.  I have a Taylor Made R7 Superquad and I went back to it.  I hit a fade, draw at will with it.  I hit a draw with Razr and it fades.  Crazy fades too.  It's all over the place.  I'm gonna either get a R11s or RBZ. Still trying to decide.  Superquad is best driver ever made by far.  Its just getting old. Losing its pop
I'm hitting longer and straighter.
For the longest I've been playing with some handme down clubs.  Finally, decided to purchase some clubs that actually work to my favor.  I recently restored confidence with my Old Big Bertha and upgraded to Fit after watching the videos and reading all the write ups on this club.  If there was ever a club that made the golfer this is it.  Improved consistency, lighter club, adds confidence to your drives for sure.
No joke, I purchased the Razrfit after test driving several drivers in a simulator, including TM R11S, Cobra AMP, TM Rocketballz, and others. I outdrove all others with the Razrfit by 40 yards! I thought this was computer BS until I took it to the course.  Holes where I used to be 180 away after my drive, I'm now 140 -145. This is backed up by my SkyCaddie.  I've shortened all driver holes by 3-4 clubs. Also excellent with a punch stinger. BUY THIS DRIVER!  You won't be disappointed.
To play golf.


                            It increase the distant off the drive from the tee.


                            There is nothing weak about this driver.
not very light, used on hole six pulled out of bag on hole 7 and shaft was snapped in two
I am a beginner at golf and I committed myself to learning the game which is why I chose to buy this driver.  In the past I have had a hard time at the tee but when I played with this I hit the ball every single time.  I even hit a drive over 270 yards.  I definately recommend this driver.
Very hard to miss the sweet spot
Hit every driver in the store over a 3 month period. I bought the Diablo Octane and could not be happier. My distance and accuracy have improved, and a lesson didn't hurt. Now I'm hitting more fairways and scoring  better.

                            I had never owned a Callaway driver before, but I am a believer now.
I bought this driver to replace my old hand me down driver.  I used to slice my other driver but now I'm able to hit the ball straight and even draw the ball.
I love this driver! I took it to the driving range and my drives gained 15-25 yards. It's absolutely amazing!
As soon as I unwrapped this driver I have hit it really well.Very forgiving. Well worth the money for this club.
I use it off the TEE.WELL WHEN i hit this driver i love the sound and the way it comes off the club like a bullet..love this club.IF U dont hit it correctly u will pay the price..
I saw improvement on my game the first time I used it. Great club for [$].
Added a lot of distance and control to my drive
I looked on-line at all the different options out there, and there are a lot of different options out there.  Went into Dicks with a game plan of different clubs I wanted to hit on their indoor range.  Hit 6 balls with these first, turned to my wife and told her I was ready to check out.  Upgraded from a starter Hippo set I got 10 years ago and what a difference.  Awesome feel, hard to hit a bad shot.  Played 9 holes with them and shaved 6 strokes.  Upgraded my driver and 5 wood 2 days later to Callaway RAZRX's the following Tuesday.  Hit the driver on the range and it was hard to tell how far the ball was going it was so far away.  Like the other guy said, not recommending these to anyone I play with...
I upgraded to these irons from a basic beginner's set. I'm averaging 15 to 20 yards longer and very straight. The 3H, 4H, and upgraded the 5 iron to a 5H are even longer. The ball seems to jump off the club. I am still trying to determine the distance each club plays. I do recommend getting the proper grip size and lie for optimum results. I play an average of twice a week and look forward to play these clubs. I plan to upgrade my driver and woods to the RAZR next spring. I can only imagine what they will do.
Used these clubs for the 1st time today, very striaght and added at least 10 yards per club.
I upgraded to these a few months ago from TaylorMade Burners and love them. I honestly lost a little bit of distance (no more than 4-5 yards per iron) but the extra accuracy is well worth it. After about 30 shots I was pretty used to these and had the confidence to try a shaped shot.
I just bought this set to replace old iron set.  I had the pro at Dick's make a couple adjustments to the irons and hit them at the range-very impressive!! That was the longest and straighest I've ever hit my irons.  Can't wait to play first round with them.
the price is way to expensive for what they are.
Clubs have improved the distance and accuracy of my iron shots
I've had these clubs for almost a full year now and have played probably 50 rounds with them.  They are definitely for better players, I am about a 9 handicap.  I really like that there isn't a lot of offset at address.  Mis-hits thin can rob yourself some distance but they are normally straight.  When you catch them clean you don't feel the ball at all and it feels like butter, but there still isn't that great sound.  Working the ball isn't hard at all either.  I won't be buying another set anytime soon.  I have hit a number of clubs that are more forgiving, if you aren't a single digit handicap I don't recommend them.  Buy the callaway razr x (non-tour).  They are sooo forgiving and feel great, they just don't suit my eye.
Purchased with trade in clubs, they were on sale at the time.  got great irons, just what i wanted and paid a little more than 1/2 the original price!  still getting used to them, but I am very pleased with my progress at this stage!  I'm a new player and the staff was extrmrly helpful in helping pick a quality product that i could advance with without the need to repurchase new irons a couple years down the road.
helped me to get my swing back. irons hit straight and long.  hybrids easy to hit from rough and easier from the fairway.
Have had a set for 11 years, and have not used my 3 and 4 irons because i couldnt hit them...  Decided to go with these clubs with the 3 and 4 hybrids included...  WOW!  I am hitting greens 170 - 200 yards out without any difficulty.  I am typically a 28 handicap, but shot 86 the other day with these clubs.  7 pars, mostly due to hitting greens I could never hit before.  Very impressive!
when i hit the ball with these clubs the ball flew way straighter and farther than i have ever hit.
I just love these irons!  Glad I decided on the hybrid 3 &amp; 4.  Used to hate hitter those higher clubs - now enjoy it!
My new Calloway Clubs are great.  These clubs are so easy to hit and give you at least 10 to 15 yards on all shots.  Was shooting in the 90's but now shooting in the 80's.
This club is longer and feel better than my ping i20 nice trajectory taylormade hit a homerun on r11 irons.
Weighted good, looks good, good feel. Just feels good when you grab a club. Added 5 to 8 yards distance vs old DCI irons.
I play about 3 times a week, I am a 8 hdcp have been playing for 25 years. I am the pickest of all my friends about irons. I have played only three sets in 25 years, Calloway and Ping (most recently). The new R11's are the best irons by far great distance and super feel, I can work the ball left or right pretty easy with these clubs, high or low shots not a problem. This is the first ever review of any kind for me becasue this is a great club IMHO, I don't think this club is for the high handicapper as it is not as forgiving as some other models out there, but if you are a player this is it.  Golfing in Mississippi.
I carry an 11 handicap, and for about 2 years I have been trying to get into single digits.  I traded in my Titelist DCI's for the R11's, and immediately am seeing better scores.  I read that a lot of people are gaining distance, which isn't that important to me, and honestly I haven't had a whole lot of change in my distances.  What I am finding is the number of shots that are pure and solid have doubled in a round for me.  The look of the club gives me confidence because they still look like a blade, or at least much more than a Ping G20 does, and I still get some help from the club on mis-hits that a blade iron doesn't offer. The price is high, but if you can afford them, I hightly recommend these.
I bought these clubs about 3 months ago and absolutely fell in love with them...when you hit the ball with this club it just launches off the face and flies straight...if you can afford these clubs BUY THEM!!
The clubs work great and added atleast 10 yards to my game. Only problem is a friend of mine has the burner 2.0 irons and I hit them almost the exact same. In my opinoin the Burner 2.0 is more accurate and a better buy!
The feel and sound flow with each other. I wont swing anything but a Taylormade after these. If you can afford em there great clubs. They added 10-15 yards to my game wich in turn shaved srokes.
I was fitted by the golf professional at Dicks, big mistake. I'm 65 I was put in std lie and lenght in a stiff steel shaft. I lost 15 to 20 yds per club. After my purchase I found out all they had in stock was the stiff shaft, isn't that special.

                            Went to Taylormade clinic was refitted to 3/4" longer 1 degree up and reg flex graphite. After I had clubs reshafted and adjusted I love them, 1/2 club longer than my R9's and easier to work the ball.
I play 2 or 3 times a week, and these irons have really in increased my confidence when standing over the ball. They have the look of a blade iron, with the forgiveness of a game improvement iron. This is the best set of irons I have ever played and I highly recommend them for anyone looking to improve their game.
Went from a Graghite set of R9's reg flex, To the R11's in KBS steel in stiff flex. I noticed an immediate improvement in ball flight, my ball flight is slight lower and about a half club longer. Great feel and very accurate. 3and 4 irons are very easy to hit. Straight is the prefered line, left to right is easy, right to left can be done but not quite as easy.
Ideal irons for average to good golfers. Nice to be able to hit them before you buy them
Let me start off by saying that these are fantastic irons, and I have gained distance. I was long to begin with, so I was more interested in the forgiveness of the irons. I have had to adjust since I had my old irons for over 10 years and you get used to a certain feel over time. That said, when I hit it true, these feel smooth as silk and are forgiving. I hit balls that would have sliced off with my old clubs, but seemed to fight to stay straight with these. I  am very happy with the overall purchase and would recommend them to a friend.
My Boyfriend says these are the best clubs he's ever played with!  He's been playing Golf for about 15yrs, and Loves Loves Loves Them! :)
I had been using an old but great set of Ping Eye 2's for 10 years.  I finally decided to buy a new set of irons.  After hitting these at a practice facility I knew they were the right choice.  I hit the RBZ's anywhere 15-30 yards further for each club.  I used to hit a 5 iron about 170 yards.  Now I can consistently hit 190-200 with a full swing.


                            Off the fairway they are amazing.  The 4 and 5 are more like hybrids and I have yet to master them from heavy rough, but with the extra distance I can typically make due with shorter club.


                            They are very forigiving and have given me the ability and confidence to club up and take shorter swings to work the ball into tough pins.
I have been able to hit these much longer and straighter than my old Hogan Edge clubs.  My five iron was going about 185 yards, now it is about 205 yards.  WOW.  The club shafts are a bit longer than other clubs I tested which allows for more club head speed, but may sacrifice some accuracy.  The top-line is pretty thick which doesn't look too great, but frankly, I would rather have clubs that lower my score than ones that simply score style points.  I would also point out that the clubhead is a bit heavier than the average iron, so be sure you like the way it feels before you buy.  Lastly, if you are used to 25 year old clubs like mine that were similar to today's "tour" models, you will notice that these clubs induce a small draw, which is really nice!  Other clubs like the Callaways tend to have a much larger offset which results in a full-fledged hook if you typically hit the ball fairly straight like me.
The staff was very helpful, and the clubs are fantastic. Very accurate, but don't seem to hit as far as my previous irons. Moving up one club does the trick.
Keeps the ball flight online with the target
my 5 iron I used to hit 175 now with these around 200 yards. I absolutely love these.
had these clubs three weeks, GREAT improvement my first round, easy to hit....
I haven't played enough rounds yet to give a total review, but so far they seem to be consistant in distance, between 1/2 to 1 club longer, and help to hit accurate shots. They have a high ball flight, which should help to hold gteens.

                            So far, so good!
great feel and so much more distance.great club
each club is longer and easy to hit
I use these Taylor Made Rocketballz on the golf course. These irons are so easy to hit and also get more distance from them. Cant say whats not so great about them.
I used to hit a 6 iron at 150 now I hit a 7 or even a 8 I love these clubs
I started playing again in 2010 because my wife wanted to play.  I played on/off for 20 years and am a high handicapper.  I use to enjoy the game but not passionate about it like my wife.  Bought Callaway Big Bertha Graphites in 2010 and did okay.  Traded these at Dick's for the Taylormade RocketBallz and what a difference!  I'm still not as good as my wife but I now look forward to playing 18 every weekend.  The clubs are as advertised.  They are very forgiving.  I'm 64 and bought the steel shafts.  I never played this well before.  Great clubs!  I also have to add that the folks in the Golf Dept at Dick's in Pineville,NC are great.  Especially Mike and Rich.
I switched from an old set of Callaway irons to these new TaylorMade RBZ irons and hybrids and the difference was noticed immediately. The clubs seem easier to hit and the contact is better with every strike giving me a few more yards with each club. And the hybrids, definitely a step up from any of the hybrids on the market right now. Great feel, added distance and improved accuracy.
I was told that you could not get 4h and 5h with the irons without buying a 5h, which is what I did. Then I find out that I could order the irons that way 4h-5h 6 iron thru AW. I am not happy at all. I was lied to just to make a sale, and I am stuck with aa 3h which I did not want.
I've been a solid believer in the hybrid sets for several years as I can't hit a 3 or 4 iron to save my life. I'm literally hitting one club length longer than my previous clubs. The face is extremely forgiving and has great feel. The hybrid clubs give me more options on long par 4's and par 5's. I'm extremely happy with this purchase. Only con is the grips. I live/play in AZ and the stock Taylormade grips don't play well in hot weather.
Played with them for two weeks now. Very solid feeling and sounding, never get a vibration. I have gained about 5-6 yards from 9-7 irons, 5 &amp; 6 maybe a copule more but easy to hit. I have the 3 &amp; 4 hybrids with my set, very nice but still getting used to them. Very accurate!
actually get a better feel and distance even as a high handicapper.
Love the feel, got greater distance,well balanced clubs.Dick's online made it easy shopping.
Returned this item; didn't get what was advertised on the internet.
I've gone from being a 6 handicap in my younger days to a 15 in my fifties. These clubs are forgiving, but don't have the lifelessness of a typical cavity back. I've played three rounds with them and can't say enough good about them. Definitely buy the Satin shafts and I ordered oversized grips which seem to allow me to keep a more solid feel through impact.
Awesome irons for low handicap players. very smooth feel.
I have been a long time blade player but this new club by Callaway has a great feel, sets up nice and the look at address is special.  They have a solid feel and with the Project X shaft just a perfect combination.  Also the soft steel allows for easy loft and lie adjustments to make them feet like a glove.....

I've used this DVD as part of my elementary music classes, however, it can be used with all ages. Provides opportunities to teach aspects of rhythm, dance, and world culture. Fun and fascinating to watch!
Dance remixes don't do justice to the original songs--pick up the original albums instead.
We bought two for the Pioneer CDJ 850s. Works great. Lots of extra pieces to customize for the interior fit. Also use to lift backs of CDJ's while working. Fronts of case have lifts to remove so you can use the CDJs in the case and still use cd's. For the most part we never take them out of the cases now.
I still got respect for Vast Aire ever since The Cold Vein. this album is on fire right now.
Love this little guy. We have two cats in our 1000 sq foot condo with all hardwood floors it's perfect for us. They did a great job on the design and they've used quality components. Well worth the price at $60. Here are some of my thoughts: - The hose was a great idea. Very comfortable to use (easier to swing a hose rather than the entire dustvac) - The hose allows me to point the motor fan away from the dirt I'm trying to vacuum. - The hose stores conveniently and easily around the vacuum - The hose end has a convenient flip down brush that I use when cleaning my white baseboards (avoid marks) - The transparent dirt windows let you see when it needs emptying - Dirt compartment is easy to empty and the filter is easy to clean. - It's relatively quiet (just loud enough to scare the cats, haha) - It's powerful enough to pick up dirt and crumbs - Battery hasn't died on me while using it (15 minutes at a time) - It's compact and sits on the floor in the corner of my home office
I love this little vacuum! It really makes quick work of vacuuming the stairs, my car, and litter spills. It is very light and easily handled in tight spots. Easy to clean. But it is loud, especially in a tight space. I suggest earplugs if you have sensitive ears. But a great vacuum nonetheless!
If your looking for a Mini Canister Vac, then this is the one to get. We've had different ones over the years and so far like this one very much. To bad one can't buy it at your local hardware store and not have to order online......would be a great selling item in stores.
My main complaint about this hand vac is the same complaint I have with all cordless hand vacs: Why can't there be a longer lasting battery or why can't it come with a spare that can be quickly changed out. Try to clean a car out in 15 minutes, and forget about mutli-tasking. Overall this hand vac is super convenient. It is easier to use than most and adapts to more situations which makes it even more frustrating when you want to do more but lack the longevity. Performance is on par with other black and decker hand vacs so there is no complaint there. For the short duration of the battery the price is about $15.00 high. I would pay extra for double the battery life or the option to change out batteries.
My wife had gotten me this mini vac as a gift (as most men were getting flatscreen TVs). As long as you don't use this to try to vacuum your whole house (as the other reviewers seem to be doing) this mini vac works GREAT for small messes and to pick up pet hair (the typical jobs of hand held mini vac/dustbusters). The suction is great...seems to be even more than the typical hand vac and definetly more than our 5 year old 14 volt Black and Decker dustbuster. The vac can be a little on the heavier side. The pet hair tool works well, removes hair stuck to the couch easily. I think it is important to follow the battery charging instructions in the manual.
OK, I really should have read the reviews on this one before buying it, I didn't. As mentioned before, the battery life is about five minutes at best; and worst of all there is no way to pug this vacuum directly into a wall outlet to make it run for any reasonable amount of time. It would be nice if Black and Decker, who really do know how to design tools (The reason I bought this sight unseen) would provide some way to plug this thing in directly to a wall outlet. But it is designed to only be able to use it's battery and its battery run-time is terrible. If you actually get a full five minutes out if this before it has to back into a long charging cycle again (Oh, yeah, its a very long time to recharge it) you will be lucky. I bought this based on Black and Decker s reputation, their reputation has just gone down in my eyes.
I bought this vac so I could do quick cleanups in the car because I let my daughter eat snacks in the car and she gets crumbs everywhere. For that purpose it's great, no plugging in, just run out to the car with it and vac off the seats, car seat and some on the floor. That's about all its good for because the suction drops off so fast. The battery will run for more than 10 min, but the suction isn't there. Easy to dump out the dirt, but anything bigger than dirt, there is no way to get in there and dig it out, like hair or grass. If the suction stayed good longer, I could deal with that part. But I'm glad it works for the kid messes in the car. I think this should have been a $20 vac, not a $60 one.
This product does what it's supposed to do, it makes one very good cup of coffee. It uses a permanent filter so you don't need paper ones and can use regular ground coffee, no need for pods. I took away one star because if you're not careful, the water can back up if the filter is not seated correctly.
Small, handy, and effective. Does what it is supposed to do. Good value. A piece of advice: always check that you have a good battery when you buy it. The battery is the weakest link as some battery manufacturers provide an inferior product.
I purchased one about a year ago, it worked great, lots of power. My wife tends to leave the battery plugged in and forget about it when it needs charged ... toasted the battery and the charger. Replacement battery and charger is more expensive that a new unit. I plan to buy another one just like it and insure that she doesn't abuse the battery.
I tried to buy the most expensive Dustbuster I could find, and this was it. It's nothing special, not an improvement over an older model I had, and really quite a disappointment in power and functionality. I would not recommend this to anyone.
Much more Powerful & better endurance than Hoover's very expensive lithium ion vac. Just slighly less powerful than B&D's PIVOT model but way more endurance per charge. It uses the tried and true design that is sturdy, well balanced and easy to clean. I like the battery pac design rather than having the batteries built in - makes it easier to exercise the batteries - You just run it down and slam in the freshly charged spare.
I did a bit of research and landed in this item. I am totally satisfied. I hope this review helps.
Good vac for the car. Garage handy, works good for a short while.
The Black and Decker cordless workshop hand vac is handy and portable, easy to use. It's powerful enough to pick up almost anything!!
This is a great little product. Very handy for those quick clean up jobs. Just make sure battery is locked in or it will fall out
It works fine, not too strong. Is good vacuum for the price
I've tried several different name brands, it seems like I go thru a shredder per year. This has the best sounding motor I have heard in a shredder, it is powerful and works great. Value wise you can't beat the price and it looks good. The waste container is a little small and it has an auto stop feature when full.so you need to keep it packed down or empty.
Jammed very fist time i used it. it does work but you really need to watch how much paper you put through it,
I bought this and loaded one envelope and guess what... It stop working and would not turn back on......I was so upset....Its not a cheap shredder and I could not believe that it did not work.....disappointed :(
I just picked this up and it's pretty strong, staples and paper clips no problem, the turbo feature is nice to get through jams. I don't like the "basket full" auto shutoff, it stops shredding when the bin is only half full so when doing a lot of docs it requires a lot of emptying, not a big deal, though. I haven't had it but a day so I don't really know about reliability.
My Staples shredder died on me today which prompted me to purchase The Black & Decker 10-sheet Crosscut Paper Shredder. I initially wanted to buy the Init 10-sheet shredder but the salesperson convinced me that Black & Decker 10-sheet Crosscut Paper Shredder was a bit more reliable. This unit works very well and I really like the turbo feature that allows you to get through paper jams. Nice feature to have in those situations. Motor is relatively quiet but powerful. It also has a protective tray that guides paper while shredding which is also a nice feature. All in all I am pleased with my purchase and would recommend to anyone using for personal use.
Overheated with 20 sheets running at half capacity!! Would not recommend!! This is going back to the store for a refund!!
I intended to purchase an Init shredder that I had researched on Best Buy for rating, but 2 of them were out of stock. I bought medium priced Black & Decker, for reputation of their equipment and a 3 yr. warranty listed on the box. I could tell it was smaller can than one that had let go on me a week earlier, gears finally went. That one lasted 5 yrs, cheaper one, but cross-cut, and alot of personal use. This shredder is the noisiest thing ever, but aside from that, it is messy. It leaves pieces of paper in the blades, paper dust throughout. I not only had to dump it 2 times, just to catch up on shredding, but had to take paper out of the blades 3-4 times while shredding. I've only had it 4 days, just tried it 2 days ago, and it is going back. I will either wait for one of the Inits or will look elsewhere, and continue to look for one with a good reviews. BTW the 3 yr warranty is only on the blades, the rest of the shredder, including the gears are only 1 yr. This is deceiving on the box.
I have owned B and D Under the Counter Toaster Ovens for over 30 years. This is the most difficult to use and always burns the toast. What happened to on/off - light/med/dark. Why does it have to be so complicated!!! Ridiculous. Also NO pan, so it really isn't an oven either!!! VERY disappointed!!!
I finally bought this item at Sears, thinking the high priced oven would be the best, most complete buy. I was extremely disappointed to find A BROILER PAN IS NOT INCLUDED with the purchase! Heck, half the usefulness of a toaster OVEN is the bake / broil function. I'm sure the additional plug feature is useful, but the lack of a broiler pan I just found chintzy and disgusting. Boo on Black & Decker!
The compact size and rechargeable battery is great for cleaning car interiors and small, dry messes. Better than my wife having to lug the full size around for the small stuff. Decent power, but, as w/ all small units, you always feel like you could use more suction.
I looked at several portable vacuums, this one was hands down the best. Holds up while vacuuming the car and has really great suction.
This hand vac is the best cordless vac that I have ever had. It is quite powerful and is able to reach in very small spaces. It does a fantastic job on steps. I also like the fact that it requires so little storage space.
I just bought this hand vac four days ago. I charged it for a full 24 hours as instructed. The first night I used it -- just for a couple minutes, it was great. Picked up all the little crumbs on the floor from my toddler. Then tried to use it the next morning, and the battery died after about a minute of use. Charged it again for about half a day, and tried again. And again, the suction starts out strong, then starts to die. I have, of course, emptied the canister and cleaned the filter, but it still loses suction after about 1-2 minutes, even though I've charged the stupid thing for hours. I just don't get it. I'm gonna have to take this one back.
Purchased this soon after moving into my new home(actual date- 1-28-2011). It was purchased primarily as a quick draw pet hair removal tool so it was used daily. It then progressed into a quick tool to help clean leftovers from crosscut shredder, and typical home tech. Month one i noticed that the suction decreased. Didn't think much of it other than to clean the filter. That did NOT help. In fact, it declined as to date is useless. It can't even pick up per hair or dust. All in all it was a great deal, i wanted to buy a couple more as gifts, but after my experience with this, no thanks. If being used for tech dust and pet hair(in hard to reach corners) can kill it in a matter of months, i would not give it to anyone.
Compact and powerful, this vacuum has been great. Easy to use, and really like the 'no mess' emptying of the collection bin.
The hand vac is very powerful and does a great job of picking up all types of dirt. The pivoting head is helpful in that it lets you get in to all types of spaces. The brush attachment is great for vacuuming around more delicate items. The collection chamber is easy to clean out.
Had to return. No wall mount. I saw purpose in a dustbuster that you had to store hidden away in a corner or what??? If i have to go hunt for it, i'll use my electrolux.
Had an older Black & Decker PV 1800.......battery went dead after many years. Cheaper to buy the new model.....Doesn't disappoint. Other on line comments on dirt sliding back out after shut off, doesn't happen with mine..........Great little hand vaccum.
This is the most powerful handheld vac that I've ever used. Stays charged for a long time. Great for cleaning up small areas.
This hand vac has very good suction and is easy to empty. The built in brush attachment is useful, especially on carpeting and upholstery. Does a good job of removing pet hair from furniture as well as stray cat litter. Am very pleased with its performance...
Like the feel of the unit, veyu solid and picks up stuff easily
Love it... Easy to use and empty. Very powerful. Slightly on the loud side but thats what you will get when you want suction.
POWERFUL VAC.SUKS UP DIRT REAL WELL AND CAN GET INTO HARD TO REACH PLACES. JUST A LITTLE BIT ON THE HEAVY AND LARGE SIDE COMPARED TO OTHER HAND HELDS. A DEFINITE KEEPER.
Much more powerful than I thought it would be! Purchased it to vacuum my car and does the job quite handily...Battery life is pretty good, and it sucks up everything in it's path!!
Needed a portable vac to suck up cat stuff and household/car areas. This vac does the job. Folding action makes it small for storage. Great vacuum action. Easy to clean. Only item on wish list would be a wall mount. Highly recommended.
this has great power and works well on all types of dirt and dust. Easy to clean the dust trap
Looks different and work very well. I am very pleased.
This is my first hand held vac in a long time. I bought it specifically for cleaning up around my hamster cages (bedding, droppings and crumbs that all fly out of the wheels when they spin them). It works great. My wife used it clean between and under the cushions of our couches and also used it to vacuum the truck out. I expected it to do well on the couches, and it did just that. I was amazed at how well it did in the truck. A side note...As stated in a couple of other reviews, yes if you flip it a certain way some of the stuff you vacuumed up will fall out. I fixed the problem. When I am done vacuuming I wait until I have rotated it back to its resting position before turning it off. Also when I go to use it the next time... I turn it on first and then rotate to the position I want it in... This avoids any spillage from previous or current vac jobs. No big deal in my opinion. Great suction, Nice all in one design, no extra pieces to mess with because it's all built in. As far as battery life is concerned ...Well I have never used it for more than 15 minutes and during that time it did not die and or lose suction.
While the premise is good, and the suction power is too, the unit disengaged several times while i was manuevering it, causing dust to fall etc. It would be great for husband's and cars, not carpeted stairs. The swivel feature is nice, but the charging is minimal and the implements are stiff and I would have probably broken them if I had persisted. But for the garage, or basement or again, " Mr. Fix-it" it would be a great gift... Price is a little over blown, but then again, they should be marketing it to guys, not us gals. It belongs in Home Depot, not Best Buy. And it's heavy. Check out the Bissell, it's amazing, tho there are drawbacks to it ( again, weight but worth the sacrifice.)
I guess it is too soon to know if there are any negatives but the pluses make this an excellent product. I love the way it folds in half, thereby making a small footprint for storage. This unit replaced a Shark battery run small little thing but the size, when folded, is not that much bigger. Very powerful and battery charge lasts well.
I have a German Shepard dog which sheds, even with constant grooming and a kitten that plays in the litter box, tossing that litter 3 feet in every direction around the box. This handy vac is the perfect tool to helping keep the place clean; I love it! My only complaint is that litter sometimes falls out of the container when I fold the nozzle in. It's not a huge deal.
New to the hand vacuum world, was not sure about the length of power usage. 10 minutes or less. Recharging is essential. You cannot use it as it charges. The bowel of the machine contains the dust and particle housing. Turn and unscrew the housing and dump the waste. Clean the housing more thoroughly when you can. It's nothing more than an excellent quick-job vacuum. Keep it handy, I use it more than expected.
Had it a month. So far, so good! It's very powerful, and so far is a good replacement for my B&D 15v hand vac which died suddenly after about 5 years.
This little guy really does the trick. I don't have have rugs in my house so I only need a small vacuum to clean up the chairs, couches and the occasional mess on the floor, This vacuum works better then many of the uprights I've tried!
I have compared new Black and Decker 1800 and 1810 side by side. Less noise is the only thing the 1810 has over the 1800, but I don't consider that an advantage in a vacuum cleaner that I want to suck! The suction, the charging stand, the design of the 1800 is far superior to the 1810. In fact the 1810 has a MAJOR design flaw as noted in another review: Fold the nozzle back and everything you just vacuumed up falls out the nozzle! Get the 1800 while they last -- best handvac around!
This recalls the days of when industrial designers knew how to make a product that looked great and functioned well. I've had 3 of the standard B&D hand vacs and didn't like any of them. They were messy when you removed the front to empty, had weak suction and only ran for about 2 minutes This vac on the other hand is a powerful well thought out product. The pivoting nozzle, the dirt collection compartment with the hinged door and a filter that doesn't fill your room with dust make you what to use it instead of dreading pulling it off the charger.. It's a little heavy and it has ni-cad batteries or the only drawbacks but these are usually only used for short periods so the weight thing is really not a problem. What a great thing when you can find a product that looks this good and functions as good as it looks.
Upon first use, this thing seems amazing. Between the attached brush, extendable crevice tool, and HUGE power, I was thinking, man, this thing could suck up a boat! Then I turned it off, and all the dust and debris (and in my case, cat litter) that had just been sucked into the canister came pouring right out of the nozzle back onto the floor. The "flap" that B&D put between the canister and the nozzle of this thing is paper-thin and hinged in such a way that it is completely controlled by gravity. It also "sticks" in the open position pretty regularly. So depending on how you are holding the vac (up/down/sideways), the flap very easily falls open (or is stuck open), providing a clear pathway for the debris to fall back out through the nozzle (when the machine is off). This has happened more times than I care to count, and it is frustrating as heck. I know it might not sound like a big deal, like "Hey Einstein, just don't turn it upside down". BUT, the way the nozzle rotates over 200 degrees, right-side-up becomes upside-down just in the process of rotating the nozzle to put it into its "resting" position. When the nozzle is extended for use, the flap's hinge is on the top so gravity pulls the flap down (closed), that is, when it doesn't stick. But when you rotate the nozzle to its collapsed position, the hinge is now on the bottom and the flap falls open. I don't see how they overlooked this, but it is a MAJOR problem. Additional problems are that it is kind of on the heavy side (my arm fatigues after a few minutes' use if I'm using it up high) and the battery doesn't last all that long. You definitely have less than 10 minutes of full-power even when fully charged. I DO like that it is bagless and the entire canister part can be wiped clean with a wet cloth or sponge. Clean-up is simple (when the debris actually stays in the canister!). But still, until they fix this flap issue, I wouldn't recommend this hand vac. It's just too expensive to have such a major design flaw.
Does not have good suction, Very hard or impossible to maneuver in tight spots. I Waste my money
Dry/wet combo for small jobs/spills at a good price. I would have rated it higher but the blow-back from the exhaust port on the right-side of the vac is a major design flaw. In use, the exhaust air blows directly into the user's face. I have rigged/taped a small carboard diverter on that exhaust port and it has solved the problem, but still.....
I wanted a small hand held vac for picking up general bits and pieces rather than having to get out the large vac. This vac does the job very well. It has good suction, particularly with the rubber nozzle attachment. Has good battery life and has not let me down. It would be good if it had a wall holder rather than just leaving on the counter top.
While I'd recommend this overall, the filter & lack of wall mount are incredibly stupid on Black & Decker's part. It does a good job, but it's difficult to store, unlike my previous dust buster which was really old, & the motor just gave out. The BestBuy sales guy told me it's best to wash the filter out after every use - what a pain! It will deteriorate, & replacement filters are really pricey!
Lousy item....It made the biggest DUST mess and the motor was very noisy.....I had to return it and spend $25 more to get a better model...
I use it for quick clean ups between regular vacuuming. Great suction dry and wet. Easy to clean filter. Charge lasts a good long time. Very pleased with performance. Would highly recommend to others.
I just needed a dirt devil to vacuum up fluff the my bird preens out of his feathers, and to pick up stuff around his cage. It's light, easy to use, and it has an attachment to be a wet OR dry vac. great price, battery life is normal for this kind of vac, easy to hide in a drawer out of the way.
I got is to compliment my large vacuum for small spaces and it works great! Highly recommend it.
Convenient little vacuum to have for small spills. Charges quickly
This tool works well in my garage and cars. It also is a good crevice tool. Cleaning out the dust and dirt is simple, quick, and easy.
The product works well, but does not have a holder that can be screwed to the wall like other products that can keep it out of the way.
Thought it would do an OK job, but was surprised at how powerful it is. Much better than a previous brand. Recharges quickly and has a convenient recharging cord. Excellent in all respects.
I love the dustbuster--I only wish it could be hung on the wall next to the plug.
I was really excited about the product and I really have a hard time getting it to suck things up. I bought it mostly for my stairs in my house because they are short and a normal vaccuum won't work. But, I can't even get it to get the dust out of the cracks.
Very useful for the house. If you spilled something, it will help very fast. You don'y need to bring the whole heavy vacuum cleaner. I use it often in bathroom where I have a litter for my kitten.
this hand mixer is very good it has lasted me for almost 3 years and it blends good and it has a good motor that won,t over heat no matter at what speed you have the mixer on i love this hand mixer
Great for 2 people. Easy to clean and cooks fast. Over all it does its job and was a great price.
I had a Black & Decked waffle iron for 30 years and mine finally had problem so I found this at best buy and waited and waited but hooray it finally came.BUT this iron has the same problem my old one did super hot on one side not so much on the other.... Go out for breakfast.......
Good buy for price but not made for extended continuous use.
This is not powerful. Spent the first afternoon unjamming it. That is why I got a new one.
Bought this online 2 weeks ago and had it shipped to the local Best Buy. Pickup was no problem but this shredder is not worth the hassle. Within 5 minutes of shredding paper it overheated. You know overheating is going to happen frequently because there is a light on the top of it that tells you when it's overheating, just the fact that the light is there should be a warning that this thing is going to be trouble. The slot to put paper through is also very narrow. If the paper you're shredding is bent at a corner ever so slightly it makes it difficult to get the paper in. I would recommend this to people who only need to shred one or two things at a time and those who are very patient.
Excellent Shredder had it for about 3 months no trouble. Worth the price would recommend to anyone.
Great oven! Very practical and ready to use. Easy to clean. Colors match almost any kitchen.
I had to return the first one I bought at Sears because it didn't toast properly. The one I ordered from Best Buy has worked just fine. I wanted a small toaster oven that could hold 4 pieces of bread at once and this one does that. It toasts fairly evenly on top, but oddly, is lighter on the bottom and leaves "grill lines", if that matters to anyone. I like the crumb tray that pulls out at the bottom instead of one inside the unit itself. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars (4.5 would have been my choice) is the odd set-up for toasting. All 3 knobs have to be set to toast and the bottom one has to be turned past "10" and then dialed back to the desired setting. Seems like a lot of work to make some toast! Otherwise, it's a good deal for the price, sturdy, and a great space saver that does a big job when I need it to.
Fun show with offbeat characters - The kind to watch and rewatch
I love this show, can't wait for Season 3 this summer.
I have a Persian rug that unfortunately my dog urinated on. I vacuumed the rug, spread the cleaning powder on it, vacuumed it again and it's a new rug.
My first iPhone, my first iPhone case. My iPhone is white so I thought the Belkin blue with white trim would be sharp. Which it was, for the first couple weeks. I have a touch of OCD and keep my hands as clean as I can, but no matter what I did the white trim still turned a funky grey and no amount of hot water & soap will clean it. I recommend this Belkin style, but I won't be choosing another with white. Will see if BB lets me exchange but since it's been 31 days since I bought it they might turn me away; we'll see.
So far so good. Love the color and fit. Good purchase.
I got this case when I got my iPhone 4. It was a combo with the invisible shield. It is great to start off with but not for "clumsly people". Does not protect if continually put the phone in danger. Great product great price!
I wanted a basic case that would provide basic protection agains scratches and provide more anti slip. This case looks good and provides both.
I love this case, it's not an otter box obviously but it does it's job of protecting the phone well.
This is a great product. I have already dropped my phone several times and it stays on and it protecting the phone.
I recently bought this case for my Iphone 4S and it's so perfect for my phone. I never had problems with it and it looks great. Looks durable, the price was so great, very affordable. I love the combination of blue and white color plus you can still see the apple logo at the back. I give this a two thumbs up!!!
Simple to use and works great, of course I have only had it for a few months so it may suddenly self destruct but i think thats a very low possibility.
I have been on a quest to find the perfect iphone case that does not add bulk. I love the natural feel of the iphone. I have tried just about every case and I love this one for several reasons. First is the design. I love the soft but rugged material used. Also the color scheme: blue on back and white bumper is awesome. The fact that you can see through the back is awesome. Looks sick. Second, the case is thin but thick enough to safe from a drop. Its about .2 or .3 mm thick. Next, it offers all around protection except the screen. Finally, the color scheme with the iphone white looks really good IMO. Love this case. great feel and perfect size.
I love the color, the fact that it's see through in the back so you can see the apple logo, and it's protective.I know that if it weren't for the case, I'd have major scratches on it :) Phew!
connection to iPhone cable does not fit perfectly and you need to double check in order to prevent it does not charge. Not a fair price for the benefit
This is even better than the last belkin case I had. The last one yellowed pretty bad this one it won't happen. So kudos to belkin on another great case!
Nice good great awesome case for carry on in you pocket
I do like the case. I was looking to switch from the rubberized Otter Box case that tends to stick to my pocket when I try to grab it. Unfortunately the Belkin case doesn't seem to offer much for shock absorption. I then realized quickly once I got into the car that my auxiliary plug doesn't fit into the opening the Belkin case has for the headphones/auxiliary cord. Problem #2 was when I tried to plug my AV/TV cord to watch Netflix on my TV through my iPhone, the plug in didn't fit because of the extra piece of plastic surrounding the plug in on the phone.
This cover is exactly what I was looking for. I have a white phone and it matches perfectly. My fav color is blue. I didn't want to cover up my new iPhone totally. I like the fact that the front of my phone is totally visible. You can even see the silver apple thru the translucent back. All of the buttons line up great! What I really liked was that this was part of a bundle with a ZAGG invisible shield, and they even installed the shield for me. Thanks BestBuy!
I bought this case with my phone to hold me over until the case I ordered came in. The fit is somewhat questionable. The sides tend to bow out away from the phone. If you shop around online, you can find a much more protective case than this for the same price. I would not trust this case to protect against much of anything.
The best phone case ever bought and it's my favorite color.
The cover installs nicely. The buttons line up and work well. The texture is just right; smooth enough to not get hung up when putting into or taking out of my pocket but enough grip to not slip in my hand.
I did not think that this product would last and actually work. I realized that it is a Great product and tough too!
Covers the phone nicely and protects the outer edge.
Glad I bought this - it makes my white phone stand out.
Cover fits very well. I got a pen mark on it though and it will not wipe off. Overall, I like the cover
This is one of the only products I liked from Belkin. This product is pretty nice. The price was a little too much compared to other cases that I've seen that are similar to this one. But I guess that's because of the brand. I do feel comfortable carrying my iphone everywhere with this case on. Overall the case is pretty good.
Reviewed side by side with the Bose portable. The sound quality is as good or better. Excellent product and would recommend to anyone.
Overall well worth the purchase! The price is reasonable and I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the sound!
Haven't used battery power yet but it sounds great to me. I bought this for my office so that I could play music when the power goes out. Didn't want to pay for an apple ipod but it only charges apple. The sound is great and the speakers don't take up much room. Much better then I expected. It is portable so I plan to take it on the go in the near future.
Excellant sound, good full volume. Great for the price category. Price range from $87 to full list $130.
Easy to use, good battery life but doesn't get too loud.
This speaker is awesome!! I would have paid up to $150 to still be very satisfied with my purchase. The sound is plenty rich for a portable. If you are looking for a Bose equivalent, this system comes the closest, at a third of the price. What's not mentioned is that it now has a sturdier kickstand that clips into position, so the speaker stays put. What's also not mentioned is that this speaker has a replaceable battery pack ($10 online), which will extend the life of the speaker tremendously. Note that on my first use, I got 7 hours of play. I am not sure how long the 7 hour battery will last, but I don't care as long as I can order another one in a year or so. Even on battery, the sound is loud enough to bug your neighbors (not recommended, but a good gauge of volume). If the sound quality is not up to the audiophile's level, use an EQ on your PC, such as Equalify for Spotify. It will give you the levels you desire. The better quality the source, the better quality the sound. Therefore, streaming audio, depending on the source won't bring out the best in any speaker. The speaker's sound is plenty for an indoor group of 1-15 folks. I have not tested it in larger indoor spaces yet. I have also used it outdoors at the pool, but never got too far from it, so I can't comment on vast outdoor spaces. My guess is if you have a cookout, this will do it's job. If you are having a house party blowout, use your home stereo.
For the price this I-pod player is great. It can be played from a wall out lit or if you charge the battery you can bring it anywhere.
I use this in my office and I enjoy using it everyday. I have to make sure i keep the volume down, the sound quality is refined and distinctive and easily can be heard by others if I'm not careful. A great companion when I'm working alone; My work, my Iphone and my music.
For the price this unit has the best sound quality I've found. It also has a deeper more rich bass than others in the same price range. Love the fact that it charges your Apple device while plugged in but you cannot use a case with your device unless it is very thin. The remote is a nice feature too as you've got a lot more control than just the volume.
These speakers are easy to carry around especially in the carrying case, the battery (which is rechargable) lasts a long time and they have great sound!
This speaker has the sound of the big boys with a lil' boy price tag. The battery lasts longer than expected from reading other reviews. I am definitely satisfied with purchasing this speaker.
Even though the actual dock is for iPod, iPhone, etc., it is AMAZING with my Zune and ANY other MP3 I use it with by connecting an aux cable! The bass is super deep and the clarity is XTRA crispy! The fact that I can recharge and take it with me anywhere just tops this little sound machine off with a giant cherry! Thanks, Best Buy for yet ANOTHER favorite toy!
The best purchase I made this year. Easily portable. Great design, No need for batteries.
I highly recommend this product if you're looking for a portable speaker for your iPhone or iPod (or any other device with at 35 mm headphone jack using a separate cable). The sound quality is superior to most, outside of dropping $$$ for a Bose system. cNet gave this product the editor's review. Buy it, you won't regret it!
For the size the sound quality is just unreal. I just plug in my IPhone and the system does the rest.
I looked and looked and looked for a decent iPod/iPhone 4 dock but had a VERY hard time finding one that a: worked well with my old first/second (unsure) generation iPod & my iPhone 4, with a remote, that also had even decent sound quality, but wasn't hundreds of dollars. Now, I wasn't expecting Bose quality or anything, but I thought that there had to be SOMETHING out there that didn't sound incredibly tinny. After lots of searching (and a few unfortunate purchases) I finally found this one, and it was everything I was looking for! It's really fantastic. It holds both my old iPod, and my iPhone 4, with ease- without even needing to change out any inserts or anything, like many other docks require. It also has a remote which is fantastic- especially for someone like me, who loves shuffle, but also tends to skip every other song... Being able to place it anywhere, and yet not having to get up and walk over to it after every other song is even more alluring than I imagined. It''s also very nice looking. Compact enough to not take up too much space, while still looking (and sounding) substantial. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for a nice iPod dock for a reasonable price. It really preforms as well as much more expensive units. The only downside is that a lot of the buttons are only on the remote, and as I don't like using the iPod buttons while it's docked, it's important to me to not lose that remote. But hang onto the remote, and you'll have years of enjoyment with this speaker dock!
First and foremost, I consider myself somewhat of an audiophile. I, more or less, really enjoy balanced, clear, and realistic production of sound. Sound enhancements are cool for me, as long as they are not overbearing or unrealistic. As such, I am, and always will be a huge fan of bose systems; however, I am not rich, so I can't always afford them. These speakers are by far, the best pair of speakers you can get for the price you pay. First, lets focus on the sound quality. I do own a bose sound dock ($300), and this is the pair of speakers that I will be comparing to. The logitech S715i utilizes 4 driven speaker cones (2x3" standard woofers, and 2x0.5" tweeters), as well as 4 passive cones, which generate sound from the air pressure variations from the driven cones). Overall, the quality of the driven cones are what really matters, and the bottom line is, they sound great. Because they are 3", they can cover the lower end just a bit better than equivalent 2" offerings from most other companies, and the tweeters allow the larger woofers to focus on the mid range and low sounds, and still retain excellent treble quality. I would say the 4, 2" passive cones do add a bit of an aural dimension to the speakers at higher volumes, although admittedly it's difficult to know for certain since you can't tell what it sounds like without them. I can be quite certain that logitech would not have wasted the space on them if they didn't do anything. Pumping up the volume to 50% already provides a volume loud enough to annoy the family indoors, at around 75% it will begin to distort, but at this volume it is already very loud, IMO, logitech should have capped the volume at around 75%. If you bring it out to 100%, you'll hear definite distortion if you're standing in front of it, although if you're outside, it's not so bad. It should also be noted that the speakers cut the volume if you're playing off battery power by about 20-30%. So for example, if you're playing something at 50% volume and you unplug it'll sound noticeably quieter. This is likely done to preserve battery life. All the aforementioned "volume percentages" are based on plugged-in volumes. Compared to the Bose sound dock, the S715i is somewhat inferior (don't get your hopes up) in terms of sound quality; however, they are VERY comparable--the S715i is still an AMAZING pair of speakers. Overall, the sound dock wins with its lifelike resonance that Bose is so famous for (and no is seems to be able to replicate). The S715i still however, sounds excellent. [Nitpicking here, so don't let this sway your buying decision too much] The tonal range between the two are very comparable--I will give the sound dock a bit of an edge in the trebs, and I think I can grant the S715i a hair of an edge on the lower ranges of the mids; however, the sound dock does have better replication of lower bass hits (the S715i sounds more hollow by comparison). Keep in mind however, that the sound dock is $150 more expensive, and I picked up the S175i when it was $90 on sale, so its an amazing deal. As far as build quality is concerned, the A715i is excellent. The front grille is all metal, and the plastic housing is solid throughout. The kickstand doubles as a cover for the docking port, which flips closed (along with the countour of the speaker) when not in use. The docking port does not use individual inserts, instead, it is lightly spring loaded, so that it can accomidate any ipod/iphone model (not ipad for obvious reasons). The auxilary port and charging port is covered by a sturdy rubber flap, which is somewhat annoying to open, but shuts securely closed when not in use. Overall, the build quality and design is excellent, as expected from a device that was preceeded by multiple earlier models (MM50, Pure-Fi Anywhere, Pure-Fi Anywhere II). Lastly, the only features that could be called cons, are are: 1) This speaker set lacks many of the features you might find on other similarly priced models, such as: Alarm, some type of LCD display, skip/return/play/pause buttons on the speaker itself (only has volume buttons and on/off button). Personally, I don't care for ANY of these, it really overcomplicates the device, and if you have a newer idevice, it can accomplish all of the aforementioned features anyway. 2) Could have been a bit smaller. The speaker is a bit wide, I'm hoping the extra space is takes up is being put to good use. It can definitely fit in any backpack (even a small one), but don't expect to stuff this in a medium sized messanger bag, or purse. I will say, because it's wide and skinny, and slims down towards the middle, instead of having a more square profile, it's easily carried with one hand. In terms of weight, it's solid and sturdy--not so heavy that you're lugging around a brick, but not so light that it feels like it's going to snap in half. I plan to take this speaker around with me hiking. 3) The bag it comes with absolutely sucks. Its a thin mesh bag. The same kind of tarp material you find on tennis courts (to break the wind) or on the courtesy shopping bags you find at wal-mart. It's thin and won't protect it at all outside of small scratches. It closes by two small pieces of velcro. The bag does have a slot to carry the power adapter and remote, but the vecro is so small, the small remote could easily fall out. Also, I'm even worried that the power adapter could scratch or ding the speaker while it's in the bag. Bag was a definite afterthought on this speaker, which is a bit of a disappointment, as older logitech speakers came with a nice, solid, foam, zippered speaker bag (more of a case than a bag really). But, if it keeps the price down, I won't complain. Overall, you WONT find a better sounding speaker for the price. Coupled with a solid build contruction, as well as a well thought-out design, I highly recommend this product to ANYONE. I am even considering selling my bose sound dock....okay no I'm not :).
The only downside to this product is that I have to remove my iPhone from its case in order to dock. Otherwise it is a great product.
I LOVE this even better than the BOSE sound dock I used to have.
using it with iPod touch. with its protective case, it's not as easy as I hoped to dock AND keep it docked when carrying/ moving place to place. It sometimes dislodges, but just have to wiggle it back into place. Easy enough for adults, my kids sometimes struggle. That's the only nuisance. Otherwise, considering the price, size, mass, portability, etc., THE SOUND IS GREAT!!!!! I sampled many brands in many stores.
I bought this unit last night. After I read all the reviews, I was sure this was right for me. The price was great along with the portability but the sound quality is really poor. It is going back tonight.
This speaker is great. I love the portability and case for it. It is super loud...but only when plugged in. If it is not plugged in, it only gets as loud as the music source you have plugged in to it. I use it when I play pick up basketball and we never have it up as loud as it can get.
Awesome product for the money! This was priced in the middle of the very expensive and very low end. Its sound quality was better than players costing $50 more. I'd buy it again!
I previously had a Logitech mm32 iPhone/iTouch dock. It was about 4-5 years old when it had an unfortunate run in with gravity and a wood floor. It was not the unit's fault. While the dock spent 90% of its life perched in front of and below my monitor, it did visit a couple beach houses and a whole lot of home project sites. Based on its longevity, I thought sticking with Logitech was a good idea. The S715i was my choice, and I'm quite happy with it. Compared to the mm32, the S715i has phenomenal sound. It's also about twice the size and weight. Because the drivers are so much larger the the mm32's and has bass ports, it has very good base sound. It also has very good mid-range and highs. I read a couple other reviews that felt the base overwhelms the mid-range and highs. I agreed at first, but then remembered that I had the equalizer on and set up for my ear buds. I highly recommend setting the equalizer to flat or even better, off. (Settings --> Music --> EQ --> Off [or Flat].) I tried Pop, Rock, Smaller Speakers and a few others equalizer settings. I like Rock for my ear buds, but go with Off when docked. It really, really helps. The S715i charges the iPhone when the dock is plugged into the wall. Along with iTunes wireless sync, I no longer have any reason to use the docking cable that came with the iPhone (when the S715i) is plugged in. For some reason, wireless sync is more reliable for me than wired sync is. I used rechargeable batteries with the mm32 and found it very hand. The S715i's battery is built in and so far, it lasts a very long time. I can't validate the claim of eight hours, but I've used it for 4-5 hours between charges without an issue. The plastic lid that covers the dock connection when traveling doubles as a support foot when the S715i is in use. I saw one review here saying that it kept collapsing. I would bet reasonable money that it was not locked in place. It takes a decent amount of pressure to lock it in place; more than I would have thought. Unfortunately, all is not hugs, puppies and kittens. My major complaint is that the iPhone won't mate to the docking connector unless I remove it from the protective case. I have a very thin case, too. The dock connector just needs to be a tiny bit longer. 1/16" would do it. Maybe even 1/32" would be enough. In order to avoid taking the iPhone out of the case, I tried connecting the phone using a 3.5 mm cable from the headphone jack into the S715i's auxiliary input. However, that's not a great solution. Using the S715i's docking connector with the iPhone yields noticeably better sound. One of the first songs I listened to on the S715i was Rainbow by Jessie J. When I played it, I heard what sounded like crossover clipping and thought I was going to have to return the unit. This was a new album for me, which I'd only listened to through headphones before. After trying different settings, I played the song in iTunes on my PC. To my surprise, the sound was really part of the song. I'd never heard it with the ear buds I use, which are Klipsch image s4i's. Not the best out ear buds there, but far from the worst. I was floored (and sold). I did a bit a research and found a plausible explanation. All music on the iPhone (and all MP3 players) is stored in a digital format. (I know, "Duh!") All headsets/speakers are analog devices and are fed by the digital to analog converter built into the iPhone. The iPhone is tiny .. so is the D2A chip .. and so is the D2A amplifier. The general consensus is that the converter is good for what it is, but it's underpowered and not as good as larger, more power hungry ones. On the other hand, the sound coming from the dock is the unconverted digital stream. That lets the item you dock the iPhone into - the S715i in this case - do the D2A conversion using a chip with much better specifications (and more power hungry). It's definitely not my imagination, the music coming from the docked iPhone is much, much better than the same tunes through the 3.5 mm headphone to aux in cable connection. That's why it's such a shame I can't play the iPhone while it's in the case. I've gotten really good taking it out of the case .. with a single casualty so far. The bottom of the case cracked and I had to replace it. (The case was old, so I'm going to say it was ready to break anyway.) That's my only major gripe, but I have a few minor gripes. The first one is more of an acknowledgement of something others have noticed. That is the face that the volume level drops when the S715i is not plugged in. The S715i manual states that they do that to extend battery life. I found a high-tech remedy for it; I turn up the volume. Hasn't caused an issue with battery life for me so far. Next, the tiny, tiny remote is somewhat required. The S715i only has power and volume up/down buttons on it. For everything else (pause/play, forward, reverse, shuffle and repeat), the remote is required. I can always use the iPhone to control all of this (and usually do because I always forget to take the remote with me when running around the house). This probably sounds nitpick-y, but I have the lock screen active on my iPhone. Using buttons is faster (and less annoying). Finally, the S715 includes a carrying case for travel. It could really use carrying strap or handle. This unit isn't heavy, but it's weighty enough that having one would make it more secure. With these flaws, I still really like the S715i. If the docking while in a case issue didn't exist, it would call it perfect. Still, it sounds so good, I'm willing to leave it at five stars. Now, go buy your own.
I needed a very portable iPod docking station as I teach dance/fitness in different locations and have to lug all my stuff around. I had a Bose but after a while it had some intermittent connection issues. I couldn't afford to buy another Bose at the moment and tried cheaper smaller iPod docking stations but they just weren't loud enough even for small meeting rooms that I usually use. So I did an Internet search for recommendations and found this one. While it is not a Bose, it is the best alternative I've had. And - it is extremely portable! Also, it has a built-in rechargeable battery which is SO convenient! With 8 speakers packed into this small package it produces an awesome full sound that can fill up a pretty large room. So - for when I have to set up fast and have a reasonably sized room, this is a great fit!
I bought this for my office and it fits right under my monitors. I can take it home for the weekend. And it also charges my phone while I listen to itunes. I bought it cheaper online than in the store. I have bought two of these now....one for my use at the office which I paid full price at the store...then I went online and bought it cheaper by $40 for my house and horse arena.
Very easy product to use. The only suggestion is if you have an AUX cord that helps when you want to plug your iPad/Computer. It sounds great, just remember that it will not be as loud not plugged in than it would be if it were.
Great for price! Would recommend. I use this daily.
This has great sound and was a great buy for the price.
I initially walked into Best Buy to purchase a different speaker dock for my iPhone and iPod, but after becoming disappointed with some of the other choices on display and not wanting to spend the $$ on a Bose, I decided to give this speaker a try. To say that I was blown away would be an understatement. The sound quality was so rich and so balanced. I thought I would have to pay so much more for something this nice, but I was pleasantly surprised. This speaker does not have irritating, brassy treble notes or the typical "hollow" cheap speaker sound. Just high quality, rich sound. The sound that it puts out is much better than some of the other speakers in this price point. And it honestly sounds like it is coming from a much larger speaker. When I tested it at home, it sounded just like a little amp. It was not ear-piercing or anything like that, it just had such rich, clean and true sounds. I tested several different genres of music, and they played beautifully (rock, hip hop, pop, etc. I even tried listening to a few podcasts for good measure). The sound quality is superb, but please be forewarned that there is no external equalizer so you will be dependent on your device's EQ when switching between genres. This speaker also does not have a clock or radio, but I don't mind that since I am one of those people who requires absolute pitch darkness to sleep. So there is no backlight to speak of. It does come with a remote control, however,  and that was something I was specifically looking for.  So to sum it up, this speaker dock shines for one thing only: sound quality. There are not a whole lot of bells and whistles on this one, but it has above average sound quality and that is what makes it commendable. I did not notice sound quality dropping once running on the internal battery power, but I have only tested this inside. I could definitely see that happening if I was outside and the sound was being swallowed up by a large space. But still, I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for an excellent quality sound system for a reasonable price.
Sleek, compact design -- works great as our kitchen radio and doesnt take up much counter space due to the small footprint. The remote control is handy, but small/black and gets misplaced easily. The rechargeable feature is great -- only used a few times but very handy for outdoor events or yard work. It seems the volume/bass are reduced when the unit isnt plugged in, but not by a disturbing amount. If it prolongs the battery life, its a good trade-off. However, the greatest strength, as it should be, is the sound. For the price and size, this unit is amazing. It gives a full, powerful "amplified" sound when compared to other dock units, with the exception of BOSE, which of course, costs about three times as much. I'd say my main complaint is lack of a radio tuner. I currently use an old cassette Walkman and plug in via the auxiliary jack. It works, but is pretty inelegant. Pandora works fine, so maybe the I (heart) Radio app is worth looking into. Another gripe is having to remove the case of the ipod/phone when docking, but not sure if they can accomodate all case sizes and still have the dock be secure/aligned. Mainly, those are nitpicks. You cannot go wrong with this unit. The price of these units is usually cheaper online than on the shelf, so check into online buy/in-store pickup.
The Logitech S715i is perfect for kitchen, bedroom, or outdoors. I mainly keep it in my kitchen, but now that the weather is warming up I plan on taking it outside as well. This dock truly had the best overall sound for the price, with plenty of bass. You do lose some bass when you run it on the battery, but it still sounds better than most others. Sure, if you want to spend $300 you can get better sound, but if you are looking for something reasonably priced, easily transportable, with great sound; then this is your dock. The remote is basic and easy to use as well. The travel case will come in handy as well for vacations.
This works great. Great sound, very easy to use. Souns just like the artist is in the room with you.
Great sound quality, mobility, and the battery makes it easy to use anywhere! Highly recommend!
The sound quality is superb. It sounds like it should weigh a lot more than it does. Deep bass, ultimate mid and treble separation, this product is a great value!. The rechargeable battery last for more than ten hours and sound quality never waivers. The remote is an added bonus and creates a "Bose like" quality. Get one soon!
The Logitech Blutooth speaker system has proven to be a boom. Not only is the sound quality and battery life very good, the system is easy to use with an Blutooth enabled device.
Bought this for my wife and she loves it. It has great sound and is very easy to use. The portability is nice too, albeit the sound is not as strong when unit is not plugged in. The remote could be a bit more functional as well.
Sound is a vast improvement over last version by Logitech. Bass is good and good mid's and highs. Long play time with LithIon battery as well as strong volume, however max volume is 10-20% higher while plugged in vs. batter only power. Remote makes this very handy and battery life makes it portable party time!
...that rocks. I just bought this speaker dock today and I've been listening to it, nonstop, since the battery fully charged. I've got it cranked right now as I write this. If you've been looking for a well-made, relatively compact and attractive portable speaker system for your iPod/iPhone/MP3 player ...your search has ended; this is the one to get. And the best part? This. Thing. Sounds. Awesome! Logitech has been in the small speaker business for quite awhile with their line of computer monitors; they make some very good sounding speaker systems. Logitech has taken their speaker technology and designed a very sophisticated portable speaker dock for the iPod. The S715i is designed to accept any iPod, or iPhone, with a universal dock connector. It has a 3.5mm mini-plug on the back to accept inputs from players that lack the UDC. The first thing you notice is a high level of quality; the S715i is substantial in both weight and the strength of the "dog bone"-shaped plastic case. The second thing you'll note is the relative simplicity of the device; it literally has one moving part. That one moving part serves two functions; a cover to protect the docking plug when it is not in use or when traveling and, when flipped open, as a stand to prop the system when it is in use. There are a total of three buttons: power; volume up; volume down. In addition there is a multifunction power LED that signals various power functions and power levels. You also get what is probably the tinniest couch potato plaything you've ever seen. The itty-bitty remote basically mimics all the functions of the "click-wheel" of most iPods plus a repeat and shuffle function. And unlike some remotes that come with stuff like the S715i, there is nothing on the remote you can't do using either the buttons on the unit or the iPod itself. The S715i comes with rechargeable LiMH batteries (like NiCad batteries but way better) and has an AC power module which also acts as the battery charger. The box says it'll play 8-hours on a charge ...your mileage may vary. And yes, the S715i will charge your iPod. To wrap it all up ... there's even a soft travel case included. The front is covered with a stout metal grill through which you can see the various drivers ....and it has a bunch. There are a total of *eight* drivers. Arrayed across the front are a pair of 3" drivers, a pair of 1/2" tweeters plus a pair of 2" passive radiators. On the back are another pair of 2" passive drivers. The active drivers are neodymium speakers. Suffice it to say "Neo" speakers are highly efficient meaning they can put out some serious sound without needing serious power. Ah, but what does all this neo stuff really mean? It means this collection of little speakers pumps out a *big* sound that belies their diminutive sizes. The sound is full-bodied not tinny. While there are no tone or EQ presets on the dock itself, there are usually a bunch built into most iPods; my 5th gen iPod video has about 20 different EQ presets. In short, you can personalize the sound simply by tweaking the iPod's EQ presets. Bass? You really won't believe it until you fire it up: the little beastie actually has significant punch in the lower ranges ...we're talking a pretty clean low end here at pretty good volume levels ... and this is what gives it a solid, full sound ...like so much out of character with what you're probably expecting especially looking at the tiny speakers. But, no, you're not gonna get floor-rumbling seismic bass ...unless maybe you figure a way to wire it into a sub.... The only potential sore points I see? The batteries are proprietary; when they quit for good, you can't just run down to the local store and pick up a set of LiMH double A's. The batteries look like the type you use for cordless telephones. And the remote is so tiny that it can probably disappear just sitting on a table. It's amazing the sound that comes out of it. Throw in a high level of finish and an intelligent minimalist design and you have a great addition to enhance your iPod listening. This is another great Logitech product. You won't go wrong; this is one dog bone that really rocks.
The speakers have a great sound quality and is very easy to use. I love the fact that it has the built in Lithium battery so you do not need to replace batteries when you don't use the provided plug. My only complaint (which is a very little complaint) is that the carrying case does not have a handle.
I returned this item because my iphone did not fit on it with the case I have. I do not have an overly bulky case so I was disapointed. I was not willing to take my case off when I want to put it on the speaker.
Great price online, fast delivery and fantastic customer support.
This is a nice unit with good sound quality for the size of the box but had problems staying up. It has a cover that protects the dock when not in use & flips back for a kick-stand like support--there's the issue. It had little rubber feet that minimize any slippage didn't seem to help. After slipping several times on my countertops & TV stand, it was the last straw. There's nothing worse than your phone being docked and the entire unit falling back--with your phone docked & fears of everything falling on the floor. Not only can it damage the speaker itself but can take your phone with it. Once, it's a freak occurrence, twice is questionable, and three times--It upset me. Luckily, my phone stayed docked during each loss of this speaker's equilibrium, tipping backward. The only time I found this would stand up properly with good support was on the floor--sad.
I bought on my birthday and love it! great sound for the price and my daughter even used it on her itouch to skype. only thing I find bad is I have to take off my cover ton itouch to use. remote works great.
This speaker system offers clear sound. It is not cumbersome and is easy to set up. I have it on the counter ledge that separates the kitchen from the dining room and it fits nicely. I love the remote control device that it comes with. The remote allows you to start, stop, advance, rewind and pause. All in all, I highly recommend this speaker system.
This is a great MP3 player for the money and its portable.
This is absolutely not a unit to brag about. The Beats Boombox and the TDK 3 are, so is the $600 Bose Dock that is $300 overly priced. I want to like this logitech unit, but it absolutely has a general deep bassy sound across it's mids and highs. It sounds like it needs it's treble cranked up 50$... I hear no Bright highs in this unit. Granted, most other docks have highs, and no bass.... this unit has bass/mids, and no 'good sounding' bright highs. In other words, music sounds bland.. like there is no seperation of frequencies. Look at the back of the unit. Do you see the two radiators? Radiators are for Big tall Tower speakers that also have bright highs to counter-act the double deep bass sound that radiators reflect.. Radiators vibrate the air so that all bass and mid speakers sound deep. They do it so well, they can drown out trebble from any tweeters.
Product sounds great and is a good buy. The only problem is the remote would not work with my iPhone 4s which made it useless to me. I went ahead and purchased the Bose sounddock which works excellent but the Logitech's performance was nearly as good as the overpriced bose
This thing is great. I found it $50 cheaper in the Best Buy website, and of course the local Best Buy store matched the online price. If you have any doubts about making the purchase, go to the store and listen to the docking stations on display. I don't care a thing about alarms and clocks, etc. I just wanted the best sounding speakers for the iPod at a reasonable price. This one sounds great and has decent bass as there is a woofer built in. Soundwise, if you went a step up from this you'd be buying a Bose or a Beats by Dr. Dre. The little remote that's included is very simple to use and makes it very convient for adjusting volume and shuffling music from across the room. The dock also charges my iPod and has a built in rechargable battery that allows for hours of use without connecting it to a wall socket.
Excellent device for listening to iPhone remotely. Rechargeable battery works well, long life between charges!
I thought for 160.00 it was very pricey consider it didn't hardly have any bass, and the volume was very low. Not very good about sitting stable since only thing that keep it from falling back is the ipod cover. Only possible they good thing about it is the recargable battery, but didn't keep it long enough to find out how long they will last before a charge. I took it back for another type of shelf type.
I couldn't be happier with this unit. The sound is simply amazing and I marvel at the bass response of this thing. Pick one up...you won't regret it!
Purchased 2 of these as Christmas gifts for my twins and they love them!!! Only thing that I see as slightly needing improvement is the carry bag.The material is like the reusable grocery bags and it doesn't have a handle, adding carry handles would be a good idea. So far so good, no problems and my sons love them!
OMG the sound that come from this docking station is AMAZING, and the price was crazy I am completely and totally satisfied...I have had other docking station that broke easily or didn't last long I have had this one for about a month now I have dropped it and it still sounds great. I looked at the ihome products thinking they might be a better fit for my ipd and they sounded horrible. If you want stereo quality with amazing bass this is the docking station for you........ :-)
Overall very good for the price, could be lighter and smaller though, so it can be more travel friendly.
We looked at a lot of speaker systems for our iPods and iPhones. We didn't want to spend hundreds of dollars, so we thought we'd have to sacrifice sound quality. We were pleasantly surprised that this system competed in sound quality and depth with systems two to three times the cost. I highly recommend this system. Don't waste your money on the really expensive systems when this one does the job for less.
I love these speakers for work. I notice the sound hits a little harder when it is plugged in, but does well when running off the charge of the built in battery. Don't expect to find any radio stations because they are strictly speakers. If you want radio, you will need to use the auxillary in and an FM tuner from your ipod or smart phone.
This device was much more feature rich than I had hoped. It was a pleasant surprise. The chargeable battery is great, and gives me the freedom to take this device anywhere, even on a picnic or hike. My children use it, my wife uses it, and I use it. And I have to say even my four year old uses it, even when we don't want him to. But he knows how to use it without our showing him how. The sound is great. Mobility is great. It is a good size and hides well in our kitchen. I would recommend this for anyone.
My husband got me this for a Christmas gift. I wanted it for my workout Room. The sound is very good and it fits on a small shelf mounted on the wall.
This is a great product and has very good sound quality. It does not get very loud but is great for indoor use and outdoor if in a small private space. The only problem is that of you have a case on your phone you wil need to take it off first (otter of for example, even the small commuter series. ) we actually returned it because we decided we would end up not using it because removing the case would become a hassle.
Great speaker for $100. Sound quality good, and love the wireless aspect for my IPAD!
Bought this unit for the great sound and got it on sale for a great price ($100). At first was disappointed that it did not have bass or treble adjustment, but after listening to it for several hours realized I would not change the setting. It simply sounds fantastic! Good solid bass without booming. Clear, crisp treble. At the sale price, this unit cannot be beat.
I bought this for my daughter (high school), who is a music lover and avid daily listener. She loves this product because it has terrific sound quality, and is portable with a battery life of 6-8 hours. The remote feature works well and allows her to move through her music library from across the room. I was really impressed with the sound quality as well. It is true that the sound quality and loudness is not quite as good when on battery power only as it is when plugged in to the adapter, but it still sounds great compared to other battery powered alternatives. She takes it with her when working around the house. It's small, sleek, and attractive in design with a sturdy fold-out stand. The case/cover that comes with it is pretty lame, but the unit is small enough to slip into a backpack or bag, and I doubt many would use it anyway.
Bought this for my husband, who listens to heavy metal LOUD, and it's perfect for him. He can bring it into any room and jam out. Speakers are loud and clear.
a great docking solution for the iphone. this one had the best sound both loud and quiet when i tested in the store (other than the expensive bose) and later in my office. very nice plug and play solution.
Awesome sound.comparable to Boise but price is much better.
Booming sound from a compact frame. Crisp clear sound even at the top of the volume range. Nice feature to be able to listen for up to 8 hours on battery power only. I only have 2 minor concerns. It has a flip down stand in the back to keep the unit upright, I worry that it could break. I also wish the dock itself was a little lower in the unit to more securely cradle the Iphone/Ipod while in use. Overall I am really impressed with the volume and quality of the sound and would highly recommend this unit!
Even though I tried to talk my wife out of buying me this for Christmas, I'm certainly glad she didn't listen (as usual). The speaker system is easy to set up and has great sound quality. I don't even have to remove the case from my iphone 4 to be able to use the docking station. If you're looking for something with great sound in a small package, look no further.
The greatest advantages of these speakers is their portability and simplicity. The rechargeable battery lasts many hours, although I noticed that the deepest bass is stronger when plugged in. The docking offers almost no support for the iPod/iPhone. The connector is hinged to allow for different iPod models, and Logitech removed the little trays that usually come to allow a better fit for the particular iPod model. This design is supposedly easier to plug and unplug with a case, but my iPod classic with a silicone case does not fit with the case on. With previous models I felt safe carrying the speakers while playing, but not with these.
This is an amazing sound system for the price! I especially like the remote control and rechargeable batteries. Every week I take the system to the beach and people rave about the sound quality. Nice base kick with clear tones! Great buy!
For the price, you are getting fantastic sound, and bass. I like how it has a battery and an AC adapter option. Also, I like how you can use it with Apple products through the 30-pin port, or through a standard headphone jack to use with any audio source like a computer, non-iPod, or even an iPad. I would like to clear the air. There are some reviews who said it is not compatible with certain Apple products. I got it to work with my iPhone 2G, 4S, and iPod Touch 4G. For those who have trouble getting it to work with Apple products, I suggest trying to take the case off, then plug it in. I had to do that with my iPod Touch. The only thing I wish is that it had Bluetooth capabilities. and a better quality case. The case is just a cheap bag to prevent the case from being scratched. Also, I agree with other reviewers that there should be some way to secure the remote to the speakers. Overall....I'm happy with the product, volume and audio quality..
Great sounding, very portable device. Highly recommend it!
This speaker would be worth the $150 it usually sells for, but $99 seals the deal-- if sound quality is more of a priority than features or funky style. I not only wanted to stay under $200, I wanted a speaker that could double duty as my ipod speaker/charger dock, and laptop speaker as well [and be moveable as such]. I wanted quality sound for music and movies, wanted it to be attractive enough to be out and about around my house [as opposed to tucked away discretely on a bookshelf] and small enough/portable enough to not be a huge pain moving it around the house depending on where I wanted to be, or if I wanted to bring it on a trip. I'd read GREAT reviews online about this little ipod dock speaker on other web sites, so I took a chance on it without even listening to it first [yikes!] Luckily, it did not disappoint. I consider myself pretty picky when it comes to sound quality, and for such a small speaker, this baby has deep bass, crisp highs, and balanced middle. I like a mix of music, from indie rock to trip hop to classical to bluegrass, and it sounds great with all my music and movies. Granted, for those of you audiophiles looking for the highest quality sound, you'll surely be disappointed-- this IS a petite speaker, and if you're looking for a [non portable] main listening system and have [much] more money to spend, I'm sure there's finer quality out there. But from the reviews I read, even $300 and $500 Bose systems had difficulty beating this Logitech out on the sound quality front. For what it is, WOW, packs more of a punch than you'd expect, for sure. Compared to all the muffled, tinny and hollow sounding ipod docks I've heard that are MORE expensive, this little speaker is FAR superior. But you will give up features for that sound quality. This is a really basic system. You can't adjust the sound quality/bass/trebble (which I usually like to fine tune to my taste depending on what genre I'm listening to# and there's no radio-- ths is JUST a speaker; no you cant program it from your phone or have it do some specialized playlist shuffle or wake you up in the morning, and no, it's not bluetooth, and the remote [cute and miniature as it is] is the basic power on/off, play, pause, ff, rew... If you want fancy features, this machine won't deliver. And if you're really planning on carrying it around with you everywhere in a backpack, I could see where it's not ideally designed for that either; no handle, flimsy "carrying case" that itself has no handle. It does come with a rechargable battery, which is a nice feature, but I haven't tested out the life span yet, I've mostly used it while plugged in. I have noticed I have to up the volume when on the battery. And I'm not sure how it would perform if you're a blow-your-eardrums-out listener-- it goes louder than I'd ever want to listen to it is all I know- plenty loud to play it in one room and hear it easily down the hall in another room or be heard over regular party noise. One thing I don't totally love is that it sits back at an angle kinda weirdly balanced on the dock cover lid that flips back; the design makes it compact and light, but doesn't feel super stable in that the stand doesn't lock in place, which seems a little wambly with the tilted angle. And as far as the speaker aiming out at an angle, it seems fine-- maybe even preferable-- for it sitting on a low desktop/ tabletop area, but if I placed it on a higher location I'd want to be able to aim it more forward, which you can't do. All in all, since quality sound in a small package [and small price] was my criteria, I am more than satisfied with what this speaker offers.
Sounds good - Easy to use - I would recommend this!
The speakers itself has no problem. I can't speak on the batteries, since I always used it plugged in, but you should probably try to take it out in this case so it's not using up the battery's cycles. Anyway, the sound is just great! This is probably due to the 4 different type of speakers being used to more accurately capture the different frequencies. The only (personal) drawback I'm having is the bag, and the cords! The bag keeps it nice and protected, but I have to carry the power plug, and an auxilary cord inside, and it tends to droop. And speaking of cords, I've got a tangled mess going on. Bluetooth would have been nice, or even it's own retractable audio cord. USB port for power would definitely have been nice, so that I don't have to also carry my phone's power cord along! This is for external mp3 players, if you use an ipod of sorts, there's no problem!
Something so small having sound like that. I woul highly recommend it.
Box said would work with IPhone but my 4G wouldn'T hook up. Store allowed us to exchange for a Transportable Bose with blue tooth. It is awesome and works beautifully w/ IPhone wirelessly
It fit my needs perfectly and has surprisingly good sound for the size. It is a little heavy on the bass side though, but that could due to the sound source.
The sound at this price point sold me. Bonus to this cute little speaker I didn't know till I got home was it's battery operated as well. Making it even more fun and versatile. It's my go to dock for charging ipod now.
Had a friend over and listened to music. When he went home, he immediately ordered one for himself.
It is good but my last Logitech seemed to have better sound.
Bought this model after doing a lot of research online and listening to various IPod docks in-store. For the money, cannot imagine you could find a better buy. Crisp, full sound with deep but not overpowering bass. Very cool design that looks as good as it sounds. Best of all, bought it on sale for $107. You can't go wrong with this device. Kudos to Logitech.
(Purchased for $107 at Best Buy brick & mortar store) First off I was looking for something with more oomph than my laptop speakers but not so big, expensive or loud that it would offend my wife and/or the neighbors. I'm very picky though and I wanted something with presence and balance. A product with some low end, a balanced mid-range and a clear high end. Let me tell you this unit did not disappoint. It will not rattle your windows but it's got enough power that you'll still be able to hear it when you leave the room. Furthermore you'll hear things on the high end that you usually wouldn't notice unless you had on a decent pair of earbuds. There were other units at the store with more bass but I didn't hear anything with near the presence of this unit until I started listening to Bose products in the $300+ range. Sound quality was my priority for this buy and it's obvious Logitech put most of the price towards the audio. You'd be hard pressed to find a better ratio of price to sound quality in a product. I highly recommend!
Sounds very good for the price range. Charges quickly, gets about 6-7 hrs of play time per charge. Case is cheap, thin, almost disposible seeming material. I wish it had a better case, similar to the old style Logitech iPod speakers case. The case used to be hard, padded sides, actually durable. This is cheap thin cloth, that won't last the summer if you use it often. But again, good value for the price, so not complaining too much.
As other reviewers have correctly stated, there are better products than this one on the market for those that want the best possible sound from their audio system. But for the price, I think it's tough to beat this Logitech. The sound is much better when the unit is plugged in, but overall even when working on its rechargeable batteries it is very good, with surprising bass and good clarity. The remote control works well up to about 12ft and I doubt the batteries will really last the advertised 8 hours, but overall I highly recommend this dock.
Great sound for size and looks fantastic. Easy to move around with me. I always keep it plugged in for louder sound. Too quiet under battery operation. Only available adjustments are power and volume. For me, this is a stepping stone to bigger, better sound.
This was a gift that I mainly used in my kitchen. Loved it so much that I bought another for the bedroom on sale @ around $100. Also use it outside by the fire, the sound quality is great, although does diminish when using on battery only. Love the fact that it charges your player when plugged in.
My husband and I needed a small, portable stereo for our outdoor wedding to plug an iPod into. We visited the Best Buy store and worked with a great employee that led us in this direction. It has great sound quality and would rival Bose indoors. We didn't buy it in store and we kept looking. We found it online for a little cheaper and decided to buy. It was a great purchase and will be used until it dies! We are avid campers and are always in need of a protable device for the iPod. This will be a great addition to our camping gear.
For those looking for a portable MP3 speaker system and not wanting to spend the insane amount Bose charges, I highly suggest this little beast. Very happy with it. I would have given the sound 'excellent' instead of 'good', but it's not perfect :). Don't let that fool you. Sounds great!
Love the rechargeable battery, sound is outstanding for something this size and price, nice little remote control. Give this a listen before buying anything more expensive.
I'm actually using it with my Droid X. Use a short cable with 3.5mm male phone jacks on each end to connect Droid headphone out to speaker line in. Of course the Droid won't set in the dock, but it does rest nicely on the fold out support on the back of the speaker. Sounds great. Clean crisp highs and amazing base for such small speakers. You could spend a lot more money and get something that sounded a little better, but the Logitech was the best overall value.
Love this rechargeable boom box for my iphone! Works great!! Only downside is music volume lowers when not on AC power but, I can live with that! Fantastic product!
For as small as the unit is it packs a punch. Great sound quality and exceptional low end support. The rechargeable battery is a nice feature and makes portability extremely easy. Recharging feature for iTouch ensures your unit is always charged and ready for use, in or out of the dock. Sound output is high for such a small unit. No audio distortion at high volume while using outside. Honestly have not found or experienced a disappointing feature. Very happy with the purchase.
I was looking to simplify my sound set up on my deck. I was using an old boom box with external speakers and aux input from my laptop while streaming Pandora. I decided that the Ipod touch with a sound dock was the way to go. So I went and listened to the Bose sound dock II, the model 10 and the Logitech S715i. I feel, hands down, the Bose sound dock 10 is the standard. But after listening to the S715i I was wowed, especially considering it's about $480 less than the Bose model 10. If your looking for value, the S715i is hands down the one to beat! Plus it has a rechargeable Lithium-Ion battery that can run for about 4-6 hours, depending on volume. Bottom line for outdoor applications the S715i is the way to go!
This product is simply awesome. It is clear and full in sound. The bass and treble is preset but is a perfect balance. There is no need to waste your money on the Bose system when this one gives the same sound quality and loudness. All the other units I tested couldn't fill a phone booth with sound. This one is nice sounding, loud enough, and creates a wall of sound. Simply a great product at a great price. No need to look further.
Its a very nice speaker system. Pretty loud with the ac plug. Sounds louder using the Ipod . If you use an MP3 player the volume is reduced. I recommend to use an Ipod for maximum volume. The battery lasts about 6 to 8 hours. The sound is clear and crisp. You can buy extra rechargeable battery pack, so that you never run out of music.
This product is excellent. It is compact yet powerful enough to produce clear quality sound. Controls are easily accessible up front. The product will not only maintain your iPod or iPhone charged, but will also charge it's own batteries providing extended play without having to be plugged in all the time. logitech certainly met my standard with this product.
I bought that to save space from my old 5.1 surround sound set. When I use it in the store I was impressed. I have always bought Logitech and have never been disappointed. The battery says its last 8 hrs* so far I have seen about 5.5 hrs. It is still a good time due to the volume is generally at a high level.
Paid $101 online and cant be happier with the quality of these Speaker! This unit has worked flawlessly both at home & work, and at the beach, where it's portability shines. Some people have reported that the unit's fold-out stand doesn't function; they are not POPPING IT INTO PLACE. It has a cup-shaped insert point for the ball-shaped keeper on the back. You must push the fold-out stand on to this small ball until you feel it "SNAP" into place. You then find that the stand is VERY SECURE.
I wanted a portable device that I could take to the beach or out on the deck that would have good sound quality and would be loud enough to still hear with other background noise. After testing a few models out in the store, I settled on this one. My favorite was the Bose portable, but the cost was killer. ($400) Very crisp sound and great bass considering the size. Battery life is really good. The longest period of time I used it was a little more than 4 hours on high volume and It didn't quit. Comes with a carrying case and remote. Both are a very nice addition and the remote works well with my iphone4.. (wasn't sure if it would work with the iphone) overall, I am very happy with the logitech portable sound dock and it's a fraction of the price of the bose portable. The bose portable is definitely in a category of its own when it comes to sound quality. If you want the best sounding portable, go with the bose. If you can't spend the $400 on the bose, definitely try out the logitech. my one negative would be that the flip stand is only designed to be on something flat, like a table. When I used it on sand, grass, a beach blanket, it would tip over from time to time.
Okay, Here's the deal, I bought this Logitech, earlier this summer, I was looking at a few different iPod speaker systems that had received good professional and customer reviews on the internet, and I did a lot of comparing to the point where I brought home a couple of different systems and compared them side by side, with different types of music. I wanted something with good sound and detail first - preferably something that could fill a large room with music - with good low's, mids and high's. Also, was looking at price, features and options on these, and how easy it was to use these systems as far as docking an iPod, portability, and so forth. Here are the systems that I compared and the order in which I would recommend them - and these are all sold by Best Buy. 1. Altec Lansing iMT 800 2. Logitech s715i 3. Bose Portable SoundDock 4. Klipsch igroove SXT Okay, focusing on the Logitech first, this is an amazing product. Sound quality is wonderful, portability is great, it's small enough to go anywhere. I like that it has a rechargeable battery, but I will also confirm that when you don't have the unit plugged into a wall, the sound quality and volume diminishes a notch or two when it runs on battery power. Don't get me wrong, it still sounds very good when running on battery power. And, to have a system this reasonably priced with a rechargeable battery is the icing on the cake. The iPod dock on this Logitech, well that's a high point, it swivels or hinges back and forth, which makes docking your iPod extremely easy. This feature, of the hinging docking mechanism is something I wish more manufacturers would take not of, it's brilliant. The only negative to it, is I could not dock my iPod when it was in a case, which is just a minor issue to me. Also the remote works good, it's very basic, but no problem there. Two small negative issues on the Logitech which are very minor: 1. The cover for the power cord on the back of the system - It's some sort of rubberized cover, and this is a pain to try to pull this covering off when trying to plug in the device again, or to use the auxiliary jack. 2. I wish the Logitech had a carrying handle. I wish the Logitech had a treble/bass control, or some way to adjust the sound, but being that this system is so reasonably priced, I understand that for the money, some options are not offered. It still sounds fantastic though, and I would definitely recommend it. As far as how the Logitech compares with the other systems that I listed above, here's the facts: The Altec Lansing iMT 800 is yet another system that Best Buy sells, and currently, at the time this review was written in early September, the AL Mix is still on sale. Yes, the AL Mix is more money, and it's much bigger, and bulkier, than the Logitech, and also, the AL MiX does not have a rechargeable battery, and uses D Batteries. So, the Logitech does have some advantages here. Basically you get what you pay for, if you want more features, and a system that can fill a large room with great sound, the AL Mix does that - and it sounds incredible. If you have the money, and don't mind the way the AL Mix looks, I sure would recommend it. But, if you want a more portable system, that still sounds great, that is more reasonably priced, and again, for the money, a rechargeable battery it's hard to beat the Logitech. I have also posted a review under the Altec Lansing Mix here on Best Buy's website, please see that review for more details on this item. Moving on to the Bose Portable Sounddock, and how well that did. The BPSD did pretty good. It's a great looking unit, I like the styling, it produces good clear sound, but for the money that Bose is asking for this SoundDock, that's where this product comes up short. You don't get any treble/bass or sound controls on the Bose PSD, none. Also, at times, the music had a tinny sound to it, and did not carry over Bass that well. For the money you spend on this Bose, I was not that impressed. Comparing this Bose PSD to the Logitech, which is a lot less money, I would say if you are stuck on the Bose name, and have the money - and you want a status symbol, buy the Bose PSD, but, I found the sound quality of the Logitech compared extremely well to the Bose, and if you want to save a lot of $$, then get the Logitech. I also had problems docking my iPod touch to the Bose PSD, where often I had to remove the iPod and re-dock it to get a good connection. I did not have any issues with the Logitech, it docked incredible well, and again that swivel /hinging dock on the Logitech is wonderful. In addition, I also have a review posted on the Bose Portable SoundDock on Best Buy's website here, please refer to that for more details. The Klipsch iGroove SXT--well, It's a great looking system - I like the packaging of this. I wanted to like it more than I actually did. Bass was good on the iGroove, but the highs/treble range sounds muffled, whereas the Logitech's sound was well balanced and carried the high's over very well, and the mids, in addition to the Bass. The Klipsch also had a brick right in the middle of the power cord, which makes moving it around difficult, and also, the SXT does not have a rechargeable battery, let alone it can't be portable because it lacks any type of battery compartment or capability. Docking on the Klipsch - I found the dock to be somewhat flimsy, and many times I had to re-dock my iPod to get a good connection so the music could play. And again, the Logitech, was a breeze to dock. All of these systems again, are sold here at Best Buy. The Altec Lansing Mix iMT 800 is the system I would go for if you have the money, but if you want something more portable, and more affordable, this Logitech system is an excellent item, that I would recommend. I rated the sound quality of the Logitech as a 4, only in comparison to the Altec Lansing Mix, because the AL Mix's sound is what I used as the measurement as to how well other systems sounded. The Logitech is a definite 5 on the other categories, no question about that.
I considered other models that were more expensive. I read the reviews on this model, which was onsale for $50 off, and was very impressed. So, I got it. The sound is excellent. Especially for its size, which is only 15" long X 5 1/2 inches in height. It is very loud, crisp and good bass. I am very very satisfied and would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a docking station. I am not one to ever leave reviews on products. However with my excitement about this item, I felt compelled to share. You will not be dissatisfied.
The only issue I have is design. When putting your iPhone in the rest, it tips over, not very sturdy. Overall I am pleased with the purchase.
This product worked great for our backyard party. It can be moved with ease. The size is small enough to move and large enough to have excelent sound,
This Logitech speaker is a great buy. The sound is good and the carrying case makes its easy to take anywhere. I would highly recommend this product.
Everything is good with this unit except I would have liked to have a DC plug-in to be able to recharge it in my car rather than just have a AC plug for recharging.
This product is wonderful. We use it all the time to play our iPods outdoors during BBQ's, etc. The battery lasts a really long time and the sound quality is better than the other similar product that was $100 more!
Since I love listening to music, I first bought a Bose... the best I thought. True it wasn't the top of the line Bose, but it was way more expensive than the Logitech. I compared the two, and this sounded just as good and was much cheaper. I'm happy I took the other one back and went with this one.
Needs to be plugged in to an outlet for the best sound quality. Great for classical music.
A bit pricey for an iPod dock, but you can't beat the sound. Add in the internal lithium ion rechargeable battery and a remote and you can take this anywhere. Great product.
This speaker offers excellent full sound for it's size, without distortion. Portability with rechargeable battery is a great feature giving you up to 8hrs of music, sound volume is less on battery. We listen to variety of music heavy metal, classic rock, hip hop, classical and everything in between. This speaker will not disappoint.
This docking station will give you the quality of a $300 Bose system. It puts out great quality and doesn't distort when it's cranked up. It's portable and will last at least 8 hours on a single charge. Everything considered, it's the best docking station under $500.
My Bose dock stopped working after five years of use. I wanted a new one but really didn't want to spend $300. An associate at best buy recommended I try this in the store, and I was blown away by the sound. I was actually startled by the volume and quality so much so that I jumped from shock. I can't wait to use it at home. Additionally, not sure why some reviews said it didn't work withthe iPhone 4. I used mine to test it out and it worked perfectly. I don't think anything is as good as the Bose but at this price, it's a close second.
Just purchased this speaker system today and I must say that it greatly exceeded my expectations. I have it on my kitchen counter and turned about half way up and I can hear it very well throughout my home. The bass output is phenomenal as are the mids and highs. I compared this side by side with a $600.00 Bose on the shelf and although the Bose was definitely better, it wasn't by much. Kind of thought that when I got it home I would hear it's TRUE sound and I sure did! Excellent piece of equipment for a paltry $140.00 out the door. Very good job, indeed Logitech!!!! I highly recommend this product. Impressive!
Great iphone/ipod player. The first awesome feature is that it is portable. I love the option to be able to pick it up and take it anywhere I want to go. Remains charged for a long time. Bought this on a friday, charged it up, listened to music off and on all weekend and didnt have to charge it till sunday afternoon. Quality of sound is pretty good too. When you take it off the charger the sound quality goes down just a notch but it's not a big deal. Remote and carrying case are two excellent features as well. Overall, the Logitech S715i has quality sound and great functionality with the portable option.
Easy set up, easy to use, great sound quality, and great price..
For the price this Logitech is a great buy, it has very good sound for its size. I would recomend.
Prior to purchasing the Logitech S715i I considered and researched several speakers. The S715i had the best price, value and quality. Very happy with the purchase.
The sound quality is not bad for the price. There are no bass or tremble controls. It loses substantial volume when unplugged...even when the battery is fully charged...and volume noticeably diminishes as battery wears. Battery life could be longer. Storage/carrying case is cheesy.
Excellent value for the price. Sound quality is pretty good for such a small system. Does not have many bells & whistles.
I've read many reviews of how much sound came out of this thing. I had to hear it for myself and it definitely did not disappoint. The sound is so rich. You can hear the details of the highs, mids and lows. The sound became enhanced when the unit was plugged into the power supply. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants a portable sound machine.
Bought this with a coupon, as I was looking for a more affordable option than the top-of-the-line speaker systems (too pricey), and thought I would get good sound. Two primary uses: In the bathroom during showering, and on the playground at work for Physical Education with grade schoolers... For both, the sound gets drowned out very easily. It's hard for the kids to hear the music, and also it gets drowned out in an outdoors setting. Same in the bathroom, all you can hear is the base and no words to sounds or podcasts. Would have preferred to save up and buy the bose system. Please also note, this does NOT work with an Iphone 4, but works with the 3/3G series.
This ipod player is a very good value and I highly recommend it.
Sounds great! Louder than expected. Using it with Ipod touch 4th gen and works great!
I tested this device at BestBuy before buying. I used my iPod Touch G4 as the source. I tested EVERY brand and model BestBuy had, from the cheap ($ 19.99) ultra small, single speaker designs up to the most expensive ($ 400.00 Bose, non-WaveGuide design), Monster, Sony, Kicker, Altec Lansing, iHome. When you factored in the price (sale priced @ $128.99 when I bought it just before Christmas, now on sale for $ 129.99, Regularly $ 149.99) none of the other tested makes and models could compare to the Logitech S715i for sound quality, sound volume (when plugged into house current) or simplicity. This unit has worked flawlessly both at home & work, and at the beach, where it's portability shines. Some people have reported that the unit's fold-out stand doesn't function; they are not POPPING IT INTO PLACE. It has a cup-shaped insert point for the ball-shaped keeper on the back. You must push the fold-out stand on to this small ball until you feel it "SNAP" into place. You then find that the stand is VERY SECURE. Though the sound volume is reduced when on batteries, it still is plenty loud, reproduces music beautifully and the internal, rechargeable/replaceable NiMH batteries last a good 7 to 8 hours. The small remote uses a replaceable Lithium battery. My only concern is the lack of a storage slot in the body of the speaker system for the remote; it could easily be lost without a tether or storage slot. Though made primarily for the Apple line of iPhones, iPods, and iPad, it has the input standard 3.5 mm stereo mini-plug found on almost all MP3 and Apple products, so it can be used with any of these devices as well as with your laptop or desktop computer at home or work, and it still sounds great with these other device, better then any computer speakers I've every heard. These speakers even sounds better than the speakers in my new HD TV. Beautiful sound reproduction, plenty of volume for a large room, a party on the deck, at the beach or for a picnic, small footprint, very portable, rechargeable/replaceable batteries that last a long time. An unbeatable combination. Save yourself a bunch of dough, get yourself one of these Logitech speaker systems. You can always take it back if you don't agree, but the eleven friends and workmates that have iPods and iPhones and that I have suggested these to, have, after testing on their own, agreed that they are the best speakers they've heard. What a great testimonial; they all have purchased one of these systems.
i was completely caught off guard by this product. i got this the week before christmas for $100 dollars because i needed some speakers for my kitchen. after hooking this up i was completely impressed by the sound that came out of the speakers i did not think it would be as clear and loud as it was. even if you want to crank the volume up all the way the sound is still crisp. would totally suggest this for anyone looking for good speaker quality and a low price.
I have been looking for a speaker system for my iPhone and after a horrible experience with the Sony ALTUS S-Air iPhone speaker system (at $400) I was reluctant on my next purchase. I returned to this site and read the customer reviews of this product and that is what sold me. Although I think the price point of this product is a little high, it is in the range with other competing products. The sound quality is outstanding! However the sound quality is slightly lower when running on the rechargeable batteries. (You can hear the volume reduce when you unplug the AC power.) If you're not planning an all out blasting jam session, this truly isn't a big deal. I love the portability and the fact that it does have the rechargeable battery system. It comes with a nice carry case, it seems to be built to last and is very rugged. I'm impressed and I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a speaker system for your iPhone, iPod or any other device that has a 3.5mm audio output. (Yes, this unit will work with any mp3 player if you have the 3.5mm cord (not included)) With all the speaker systems of this type I have been exposed to, this one by far stand above all others...
Great sound quality and I love the fact that it's portable and charges the IPOD while you're listening to it.
This product does everything you would want some iPod dock speakers to do and it does it so well for the price. Originally at $150 I got it for $75 on a one day special for a Christmas gift. I immediately regretted giving it away because once I heard in at home it was amazing. Used it for a New Years party I hosted and several people were asking if that was my four speaker boombox or the iPod speakers. If I had never said anything they wouldn't have known. My cousin has the Bose Wave speakers at his house ($400+) and he said that they are better but not nearly worth the price after listening to the Logitech. Excellent value and they are rechargeable so if you need to quickly move them it's easy. Haven't had a chance to test the battery life yet. (I haven't tried these speakers in a very large room so as long as your expectations are reasonable you should be very satisfied) CNET review was on target.
I needed something to play my large itunes library off my classic iPod and after checking out quite a few in this price range I purchased them. They're portable, not too large, and sturdy. I like that I can easily pack them with me when I travel and not worry about damaging them - they're solid. The sound quality is perfect for what I use it for, though I'm not an audiophile, it goes pretty loud (or quiet), and it comes with a handy remote control. I definitely recommend these.
Ok, so not having bought any audio device since I don't remember when, I decide to find something I can play my ipod nano touch on. After staring longingly at the Bose products and not being able to figure out which vein to tap I push the tryout button on this dock. Despite the noise of the store in the throng of the crowd the base grabs me and treble doesn't sound cheap. When did Logitech learn how to make a good product? Who cares. At a third of what the Bose costs, I jumped all over this. I controls some of the functions of the ipod (volume, selection) but you can't jump through all of the ipod menus (a bit of a drawback). On top of that it comes with a rechargeable battery so the unit is portable without needing a plug (manual says 8 hour life). Portable, meaning it will fit in a back pack (comes with protective cloth case) but it is long and perhaps not the most accurate definition of portable. Little remote is cute too but also limited to play/pause, forward/back, volume, shuffle and repeat modes. This is my new favorite toy and I can't wait to hook my TV with the bad speakers up to it. I just have to buy the right cord.
"music is the best" -frank zappa It is. And I want to hear all of it, well mixed. I find myself going to concerts and adjusting my location based on the sound quality (over viewing the band). A great band in an venue with poor acoustics with a poor engineer, can't be that great of a band. That being said, if you only listen to music with a ton of bass, and boost the bass above what it was intended to be, and that bass comes from computer generated tones... you will obviously complain about a lack of bass on these speakers. And you probably listen to rubbish music. On these speakers, the lows are low enough, the mids are great, thick, not over lapping or lacking that tonal sound. The highs are good too, and are often more important and equally hard to reproduce as deep bass. So I am a snob for really sharp treble that isn't to "tin-ey" These speakers get it pretty close, I think they could be more crisp. I boosted the treble on the ipod EQ to enhance it a bit. In my car (with custom mounted 1.5" tweeters) the highs tickle my ears. Anyway. I do not think it is physically possible to get better sound out of a speaker of this profile. For really deep bass, you need more depth behind the drivers, a smaller driver needs a larger volume of air to move to produce really low end bass. And if you simply must have that kind of bass, you can ntoget it in any speaker that is less than 6" square on all sides around the driver. Given that limitation, you take portability, or that one spectrum of sound. These speakers don't leave anything else out, given the portability. Put it this way.... you know those $1k HD TVs everyone has... these speakers beat the ones that come on those set, by a large margin. TV makes should not even bother with their built in speakers, and put this one on top of the as an accessory. It is far superior. I put these to the test, listening to Zappa (you need full range for that music), Girl Talk (dance music), and even tested it on Outkast 'Speakerboxx' album, on the into song that is essentially a speaker test, that is meant to push the limits of a high end car stereo, super highs, really really low bass hits and tones. These speakers leave little to be desired. The quality, and functionality, for the price, is amazing. Oh, and you don't need 4 D batteries to make it portable.... which is awesome. Only improvement: adding a slot to store the remote in. And maybe some tabs to allow it to be mounted to a wall. I plan on modify it to make both of those happen because it is light enough that i could use epoxy to make a clip for mounting. I got these for less than $110. Given the rechargeable battery built in, I would pay over $200 for them and still rave about these speakers.
My husband bought me a Sony model in the same price range, but it came with a radio and alarm clock that I didn't need or care to use. I took it back and brought my own iPOD. I listened to all of the models and this one really played the best (other than Bose). Klipsch was a very close second, but it doesn't re-charge your iPOD when in use and when I took my own iPOD out of the base, it had frozen up. The sales person was able to fix it, but I was worried about it continuing to happen so went with the Logitech. I'm not very techie and was concerned about learning to use it. Opened the box, plugged it in, followed the very easy guide and was playing my music in under 60 seconds. Good sound for such a small device.
I cant imagine BOSE for $299.99 sounds better than this ! This speaker sounds AMAZING ! I personally brought my itouch and tried all the speakers at best buy. this by far is amazing !! it was on sale a week ago for $99. When plugged in it charges the unit as well as the ipod. when not plugged in to use a portable it doesn't charge ipod. I really enjoy the sound on it. Clear and Powerful ! It beat out many other options for me . of course I didnt even consider Sony or Bose for those prices. Im looking for a high quality sound for my music listening and I found it .
I bought this product for myself after I purchased my I-pod so I could listen to it in the house. When I set out to purchase a docking station I wanted sound quality period and didn't care what I had to pay to get it. Which is why I was leaning towards the Bose. After doing some research I came across this product and was very suprised. The sound is awesome and is extreamly clear no matter what type of music I'm playing on it. The sound quality for the price is the best I've found!
very attractive little unit. sounds so full sounding people will (and have) mistake(n) it for a surround sound speaker system. i have one and love it so much i just picked one up for my girl.
After reading lot of reviews, I almost decided to buy this and went to Bestbuy. I have to say didn't like it in the noisy environment in the store. I thought of trying it out in apartment and return If I'm really not satisfied. But, I like them a lot now in the closed space. They are simply superb. Clear and loud music from a small form factor. I can use this as speaker for my laptop too with Aux cable and volume can be increased to much higher level when Aux input is used. One thing I observed with this is that it is much louder with iphone4 than my 3GS. But, still its loud enough for 3GS inside the room.
For the sound quality vs price this beats the other companies hands down. Don't be the guy that paid $200 to $400 more and still believes the advertisement but knows deep down inside they really just got burned. Now who do you think is paying the actors? The S715i trayless dock works excellent. Its portable and not heavy. If this dock is not loud enough for you may need to be looking more in home theater end of sound. I think people are getting lost in what sound docks are really made for. They are more for outdoor decks/patios, dens, dorm rooms, bedrooms, kitchens, offices, small party etc.
This is one AMAZING speaker. No joke when I plugged this in I was not expecting much. After about 15 minutes of listening my bose sound dock was on ebay. It gets great battery life and hits EVERY note with complete precision! This thing will knock your socks off and I GUARANTEE it!! It absolutely beats everything in rock/acoustic sound. Do yourself a favor if you have an iPod/iPhone and pick one of these up and listen for yourself!
VERY HAPPY WITH THIS PRODUCT WILL TELL MY FRIENDS.
I shopped around and listened to just about every iPod dock on the market. Nothing compared to the quality sound of this Logitech S715i unit. The Best Buy salesman said he had not heard this model yet. They had just gotten them into the stores. I plugged in my iPod, turned it up, and looked at the salesman. His eyebrows were lifted up! We both said, "Wow!" This unit will easily fill a large room with crisp, clean sound. I liked the rechargeable batteries and remote that came with it. You can not go wrong with this unit! As you might gather, I can't say enough about the quality. I'm not all that surprised as I have Logitech speakers and woofer connected to my Mac, and have been very pleased with them.
I bought as a gift for my son and he loves the speakers only the volume isn't loud enough for him.
This speaker is just what I need to teach my fitness and ballet classes. I go to many locations throughout the week and needed something easy to carry.
I'm a best buy digital tech specialist and work with this and systems like it and none can compair (other the BOSE). the audio quality is crisp and powerful,base on adapter power is awsome and on battery is decent. Battery power is long. Some complain about loosing volume while running on battery, but it still gets very load (all systems do this because the rechargable battery cannot provide as much power as the adapter so you loose power).
I have found that the Logitech Rechargeable Speaker S715i, does everything that both Logitech and Cnet have claimed it does and more. Ever since I got my iPad I had been looking for a speaker dock to use with it. Now I do have to use a dock-extending cable from CableJive. Even with the cable I had found that speaker dock after dock wouldnt work with the iPad, untill the S715i. The sound quality itself in this price package rocks. The rechargeable battery makes it more useful for those of us on the go. The fact that it does work with the iPad is for me the biggest feature. Now I can watch a movie on a decent size screen, with great sound. Beats all the other docks I have tried hands down in all categories.
Where do I start? That sound quality is just so amazing. The true universal dock is amazing!.This thing will go SO loud without distorting. Bass is very deep and filling for sure. I feel like the next gen speakers logitech releases sound include extra features such as SD Memory card slot and a small LED or LCD screen with ID3 Tags. The remote control is a great feature. I am using my iPhone 4 for this and it works so well. I used to have a JBL On Stage III iPod speaker. This thing totally blows it out of the water. One thing that is a bummer is that when the AC Adapter isn't connected the bass and volume is slightly reduced (I'll estimate a good 30%). I don't care because I just use it in the bathroom so it's always connected. The quality is so amazing that I have been taking it with me in every room. I cannot believe my ears. I use plenty of Logitech products I have their Z-5500 5.1 Surround, Wave Keyboard, Performance MX Mouse, Harmony One Universal Remote and these speaker. I know these speakers are laser tuned but I don't know if that's something standard on all speakers and maybe it's a marketing scheme, but jesus they sound great. I feel like Logitech should make bigger speakers like this for their next 5.1 surround sound speakers. On a final note I feel like Logitech could have added a few more features like an SD card slot or LED screen with clock. Not real necesscities but overall, amazing product, I'm sure the next one will only be better. Maybe Bluetooth ? I should mention that I listen to stuff like punk rock, hip hop....Beatles, Nas, NOFX, Jimi Hendrix, Eminem, Black Flag, Bee Gees,Bob Dylan so I have a good mix and a very good ear. I am also a musician.
Fell in love with the color scheme, the cover goes on easily and does not interfere with the camera. I often like to switch covers (currently rocking an old school Gameboy cover) and wish that the Gameboy cover was of a similar quality to this cover (the Gameboy one interferes with flash pictures). The old saying is true-you get what you pay for. (Go with the accessory bundle package to save some $$)
This case provides SOME protection from accidental drops. The case on the phone is not bulky at all, but It feels slightly slippery in the hand, so gripping it may be an issue with some people. I wish I could find it in more colors. The essential 050 is hard to find for some reason.
Picked this case up when I bought my iPhone 4S on Sunday. I got it mostly because bb was having an accessories deal but I'm glad I did! Fits snuggly around the iPhone. The case is well made and all buttons and the headphone jack are easily accessible. Will protect from short drops and bumps but nothing major. Overall a great case!! The color looks really nice too against the white iPhone! Good case if your looking for something smaller.
All in all I like it....but I'm a little harder on my phone than I thought I would be so may have to also purchase an Otterbox.
Great product but they need to come out with an iphone5 compatible version now that apple ditched the 30 pin connector.
This cable allows connection of iPhone to external sound source (i.e., car sound system) and works well. The smaller jack permits connection with iPhone or iPod devices with protective cases. Other cables do not work, since the jack 'housing' is too large in diameter. The only draw back - the cable is too short.
I love this cable so much for my car (because it retracts and is easily put out of the way when not in use) that I got one as a gift for someone else! Never had a problem, only sometimes wish it was a little longer.
I bought this as a gift for a friend and figured it would be easy to store. When she plugged her ipod into the aux port to play through the stereo the sound was staticy. We tried pulling the cord out all the way thinking that it being retracted was affecting it. Nothing helped. She will be buying another one.
works fine as long as you pull both cable ends at same time and very gently. same with retrieval. otherwise, will form a bird's nest if you pull out a single side. velcroed to back of sound dock.
The first time my husband tried to extend the cord for use it became tangled within the unit and has never been fixed. You are better off just purchasing a regular cord, as that is what this turns into anyway.
This worked well as long as I didn't need to extend or close it. Whenever that happened, it caught A LOT!!! Finally, it jammed up so bad that the wires stripped themselves when I finally got them loose.
This item was great for a few months, however not so much now that it does not work anymore. This is not something I want to buy every six months it should last much longer than that especially since I am so careful with all my gadgets as they are very expensive and I like them to LOOK new for a very long time!!!
This device has a terrible design. Once you pull the cord out from the case, you may never be able to get it back in. It does not retract as advertised - even after pulling it back and forth several times. If you get one side of the cord in, the other sides sticks out. This is very annoying and frustrating. With such an expensive price, you would think it would actually work and not feel like you are going to break the cord. You are much better off getting a non-retractable cord at a lower price since the audio quality will be the same. You will most likely get the same length of cord without the bulky case.
I use my aux cable regularly. I have never had an issue with it and I've had it for a year. I love that it retracts. I had cables everywhere so this prevents that. I can store it quickly and easily when not in use. This retractable design is genious. Most importantly, the sound quality is just fine.
I purchased this to replace another retractable belkin product that I had had for 3 years. This one lasted 3 months. I should have looked at the specs more closely and realized how short the cord is. I looked at the spool and assumed it was longer. The cable itself is think and not very flexible which is likely what caused it ti fail where it joins the connector.
This is a really nice looking case but it was so flimsy that it began breaking within two weeks!! The break was at the bottom of the phone and was scraping my phone so I returned it right away.
I got this for my Iphone 5 - i wanted one that would not cover my phone. It is not worth the money - it is hard plastic and will not protect the phone at all. i returned it soon after I got it.
I really wanted an eco-friendly case for my new iphone 5. I was so happy to find this. It's slim and fits the phone well. Doesn't add any bulk or noticeable weight. Plus it's made from recycled bottles! How cool is that?! Exactly what I was looking for. I recently dropped my phone on concrete and was shocked that the case only had a little crack and my phone wasn't even scratched. Worth every penny!
The first night I had my phone, the top corner edge was nicked because the case doesn't protect that area of the phone. It also does not protect the bottom. Within 2 weeks the case was cracked in a couple different places. This case looks slim, sleek, and shows off the phone nicely. But I highly do not recommend it. You would have to be very careful with your phone. And I'm not a person who isn't. But the slightest misstep could leave your phone or the case damages.
The case is environmentally friendly and looks good. In particular, the smoked, clear design is what I liked the most. I thought it would add character while still letting some of the iPhone 5's natural beauty show through. Unfortunately, the case does not fit snugly at all. My iPhone slides up and down in the case . . . the fit from left to right seems OK, but I am not comfortable with a hard shell case that isn't completely snug on all four sides. I will be returning the case this evening.
Stylish tortoise case for the new iPhone 5. Durable and stylish
Really nice stylish cover that doesn't add bulk to the new design. I love the Otterboxes, but they are so chunky and the rubber wears out. This is a nice-fitting slim case that adds some flare to the phone while keeping the back, corners, and edges protected.
Great slim case doesn't bulk up the phone. Now that the new model iPhone doesn't have a glass back, I don't need a bulky, thick case. This one is slim, stylish and seems to protect well. Highly recommended for a slim case. If you want a little more bult, the inCase Sliders are excellent as well, so check those out as an alternative.
This case is durable, and was easy to put on the phone.
I picked this up just to have something on my iphone 5 after buying it. First thing I notice after putting the case on the phone and getting it home is that it has a very slick feel to it and slides on the counter and table. I am afraid the phone will slip out of my hands or off a table. I need something with a little more grippy feel to it. I also went to have ghost armor put on my iPhone and was told that this case will not work with the ghost armor because of the grippy strip on the inside of the case, that was ok with me since I am taking this case back.
I wanted a case immediately for my new phone so I found this one to be more fun and better than others I could find. Limited choices so far.
This is an awesome glitter case. The back is coated so that it is not rough to touch and the glitter never falls off. It is a very slippery case. There are no grips on it at all. The only other issue I have with it is the cheap plastic inside, it can cause scrapes on the sides of the phone if dust or other debris got in there.
I love the look of this case, I've had lots of compliments on it. Sturdy enough for what I wanted, I got a deal buying the case and a shield so good value.
I absolutely love this case. It is so cute. It might not be the most protective case out there by far, but I am very careful because I love this case soooo much!!
As others have noted, makes it somewhat difficult to access the sleep button, volume buttons...might have been nice if it was a 'play-through' design. Wood looks really nice, plastic looks nice. I think it will protect the iPhone 5 quite well, but it makes it nearly as thick/heavy as the 4s - which probably can't be helped but kind of a shame too. 4 stars because it does what it says it will do, and looks as good as advertised.
This case is much better than the Rocketfish brand which was already damaging my black iPhone 5. The 2 piece design is nice and the soft protection is great. The Zebrawood feels great (and smells great too lol). My only gripe would be that the power button is difficult to push one handed now since the opening is very small.
When I first saw this case, I knew that I had to have it. I ordered this case the day that the iPhone 5 came out, and believe it or not, it was on backorder. I just got it today and couldn't wait to put it on my phone. The case was easy to put on. The two-pieces fit together to protect your phone. The Case-Mate Black Ash case compliments the black iPhone 5 beautifully. It is black on black perfection! The wood and aluminum are a great touch. It is a simply beautiful combination of beauty and protective function. In short, I love it! You will too!
I preordered the case along with my new phone and was very disappointed. First, the case is heavier than others of the same size. The worst part is how cheap the case feels and looks. The edges are a thin shiny plastic and a terrible contrast to iPhone 5's brushed aluminum.
I had previously owned a cork case for my iPhone 3G , so this zebra wood case, with a touch of high tech look, was perfect for me
Not worth the price at all. Advertised as aluminum and wood. It is plastic and wood. Poor quality bulky, hard to reach to buttons.
Overall, a very nice looking case with a sleek wood back which sets it apart from many cases on the market. Had it snapped onto my phone within seconds and can be easily removed if needed. Buttons are slightly recessed but I prefer this to keep them from being inadvertently pressed - they are easily accessed when needed. I have not experienced any smell from the natural wood backing. At $50, it's more expensive than it should be but I could make the same claim for almost all iphone cases. Preferred this to the bulkier cases which offer more protection with the loss of the iphone's look.
I'm not a fan of this case for several reasons: 1. The wood makes your hand smell. 2. The user can't see the decorative wood. 3. For the money, the part the user sees is "plasticky." 4. Very, very hard to press the buttons. Don't buy.
The back of the case looks great - the wood is a great touch. However, the manufacturer claims the case is aluminum - it's not. The large piece surrounding the phone is a cheap plastic. They make it look like it's metal - but it's not. $50 for a piece of plastic is not worth it. Cheap build quality and false claims of aluminum are a big letdown.
bad product. I do not have any good to say about the product.
Solid nice looking case takes nothing away from the appearance of the phone, 2 piece design snaps together nicely. Thin profile. Only problem with this case is its complete lack of access to the volume buttons on the side and the on/off button. Unless you have toothpicks for fingers or carry a stylus around your not getting to the those buttons
Shiny cheap looking black plastic. Lightning to usb adapter will not work with case on. Case is heavy making the iPhone 5 feel like the 4s.
I returned the Case Mate EKO case because it fit terribly and got this case in its place. The fit is good and snug, and it looks good too. The brushed aluminum back is very appealing. The case is a little heavier than other cases I've had, so the lightness of the iPhone 5 is negated a bit with this case. Not sure if I like that or not. And, because of the two piece design, I'm slightly worried about the case's longevity. Nonetheless, so far so good.
What a great case. Fits perfectly, great protection, all while still showing the beauty of the phone. Buying another just to have a backup!
I like the look and slimness of this case, but I have already noticed scratches on my phone where it doesn't cover. I wouldn't reccomend this to anyone keeping their iPhone 5 in their pocket, or loose in a purse.
I love the feel of it. It's ultra slim, has a soft feel, not slippery, but not tacky feeling either. Bought blue for myself and white for my son. I would prefer white since I have a white phone, but I wanted to choose a different color. This is not the case if you are looking for a lot of protection. If you are looking for an ultra slim case with a great feel, you should consider it. I gave it four stars because I can't rate the durability of the case because I just bought it today.
perfect snap case and it was exactly what I was looking for. something minimal that will protect all sides and still able to show off the sleek design of the iPhone 5. what I really liked is the small lip around the edge to be able to lay the iPhone down on its face without the screen touching. it is minimal so don't expect protection like an otter-box case. all buttons are easy to access. just plain perfect.
Good fit, but I am not sure how long it is going to last. Material looks as though it might crack easily
If you're looking for a minimalistic case which is thin and doesn't detract from the iphone's appeal, this is a good case for you.
It's very sleek and hard case. Most of my friends couldn't realize my phone has a case on it in the first glance. Quality is great.
I purchased this case right after the iPhone 5 came out, as there were not many case options available yet. I thought this would at least protect my phone while I waited for more cases to come onto the market. I had the phone in my pocket, and it slid out and landed on the ground as I got out of my car. The phone landed on the side of the case, and ended up face down on the pavement. I noticed a very small nick on the face of the phone. The next day, this nick turned into a crack. I will admit this case is very slim, and light weight. The only thing it may protect well is the backside of the phone. If you do decide to get this case, make sure you also use a protective film on the front glass of the phone as well.
I don't know what the other reviewers were doing when they installed their cases, but it's pretty impossible for a rubberized plastic case to scratch either glass or aluminum, unless you had some debris in the case before putting it on? This case is simple, lightweight and will protect the back of the case from scratches. After reading the first 2 reviews I decided to pop the case off and take a look, and my phone is still pristine. I work in an environment where metal (steel and aluminum) chips and shavings are abundant, so far none have made their way between the case and phone. This is just as good, if not better than the overpriced, incase and belkin products.
Every year when a new iPhone comes out I always sell my old model and upgrade to the new one (Yeah, I know, I'm a geek). In order to get the most resale value out of the old model I always keep my phone in a case from day one to protect it. The first thing that I did when my new iPhone 5 arrived was to transfer it from the box directly into this case. Not even five minutes later I pulled back the case just to check things out. It had already put two small gouges in the side of the iPhone. Not just a scratched finish but actual gouges into the metal. I know that this may seem trivial to some but if you really need to protect the finish of your iPhone to protect its value, this is not the case to do it with.
After 1 day of using this case, I noticed my new black iPhone 5 has scratches along the edge (on the lip between the glass front and the aluminum edge). The case looks nice and seems to fit well, but the fact that it is scratching my brand new phone is a clear "no-go". I'm hoping anyone looking for a new iPhone 5 case stays away from this product. I've been nurturing my phone like a newborn since launch day and I can't believe I already have scratches---scratches caused from a case that is meant to protect the phone! DO NOT BUY. Here's to hoping I can get a replacement phone after the iPhone 5 demand settles down because these silver marks are going to drive me nuts.
I normally don't bother writing reviews for phone accessories, but with the plethora of cases that are available I felt like this one deserved kudos for being exactly what I wanted: a minimalist case that allows me to carry my new iPhone 5 in my front pocket and set it down on my desk or on a table during meetings without worrying about the aluminum back getting all scratched up. We all got the iPhone 5 because it's thin, light, and quite frankly a modern work of art. Nothing against more bulky cases if that's what one desires, but I don't see the point in covering up my slick new phone with a gargantuan case that nearly doubles the thickness. If you are prone to having "accidents" with your expensive gadgets this probably isn't the case for you. If you are reasonably careful with your devices, I think you'll be very happy with it. Aside from being very thin, it also does not cover the top and bottom edges of the phone except for the corners. This allows full access to the charging/data port and headphone jack, assuring that your accessories will not have issues fitting properly when you plug them in. The sides of the case are also flush with the front screen, meaning there's no "lip" around the front that tends to collect pocket dust/lint and other crud. I have the black iPhone 5 and this white case makes for a nice contrast. FYI this is my second iPhone 5 case; the first one I purchased was a black hard case with a silicone inner-layer and that thing was nothing but a dust magnet.
I like how it covers & protects the phone.. There's two things I don't like & that's it doesn't cover to much where the camera is.... It still shows a little bit to where you still scratch the phone... The other thing is that when you get the cover the power button gets stuck from the cover & it sometimes powers it off completely so you have to make sure it doesn't do that... Other then that I love the cover for its price...
I would have never thought of purchasing a case made by Rocketfish after having previous cases from all of the major case manufacturers, but this case has surprised me. Having purchased the iPhone5 on the day it was released ere were limited in store choices, but when the mobile rep pointed out this case I went for it. I'll be sticking with this case for a while.
Overall, this is a great case that's slender enough to complement the thin and elegant lines of the iPhone 5. As a reviewer of the Rocketfish soft clear case commented (about this case, not the clear), the black sides just look better than the clear on the black iPhone 5. The case seems durable, protective, and fits fantastic (no slop at all). The only thing that I would change is the back. Another reviewer mentioned that it's clear, but not 100%. I'd call it more opaque... it's barely clear. Not a big deal there, but I think true-clear would look a little better (if vanity counts). Finally, and again relating to the back, I wish it had a bit more tackiness, so the phone would be less likely to slide on a surface. The clear case (which we also bought for my wife's white iPhone 5 which we're still waiting for :-( ), is definitely more grippy, and I do prefer that, though it would make sliding the phone in and out of your front pocket a little more challenging. But, the sides of this case do have a grippy quality that makes for a sure hold. Again, overall, this is a great case that I'd buy again, and recommend to a friend (or at least let that friend see mine to make up his or her own opinion).
Great case for the new iPhone5. It gives the phone a slim look and the back has a clear look yet not 100% transparent.
I love this phone cover. It is lightweight and a perfect color for me. it has kept my phone scratch-free thus far.
As this is my first iphone, I wanted a case that looked good and didn't add additional bulk/weight. Lightweight rubberized plastic case that will protect the back of your phone from scratches. Case has a nice feel to it, not too slick, can easily slip into pocket without sticking when pulling it out. Keeps phone slim like it was designed. It will not protect your phones' screen, I would recommend getting a screen protector. I've read a couple other reviews that mentioned after removing case owners found scratches on their phones. I've removed this case a couple of times so friends/family could see phone without case and have had no problems. Makes you wonder what they did to phone before or after adding case. :)
I use this armband almost everyday jogging or jump roping, it's easy to slide the phone in and out, no smell stays dry, holds the phone securely and I have no problems using the phones touchscreen. I have not tried this product with a case waiting for life proof.
I bought 2 of these at the same time because we got new iPhones....one for me and one for my wife. We both run quite a bit but never together. I ripped mine when trying to take my key out after the very first time using it. The plastic material used is way too soft and not durable at all. I also noticed that this thing really holds the sweat a lot more than the one I used for years with my iphone4. Well funny thing about the other one I bought. My wife tore hers taking the key out as well!. I only purchased this because it was the only mainstream armband available at the iPhone 5's launch. These are both going back and I'll wait until griffin release their iPhone 5 armband because I used their product for almost 2 years nearly daily without a single issue.
I chose this case because it is very minimalist and allows you to see both the front and back of the iPhone while still protecting the back from scratches and the sides from cracks. However, after just a few weeks of using this case, the plastic backing looks smudged, worn, scratched, and uneven in texture. I have tried cleaning it to no avail. I really wish that the backing was a stronger material! It looks bad. I don't do anything crazy with my phone; mostly it sits on a table top. I spoke with Griffin's support team and they said "I have seen that a couple times, although it doesn't seem like a common issue."
I bought this case for my wife after ordering the Griffin equivalent. This case is quite a bit better as it is easier to grip and easier to access the ports and switches than the Griffin. The only negative is that the clear plastic tends to scratch (as does the Griffin), however, I'd rather this scratch than the iPhone!
This is a very nice case. I got it because I still wanted to see the rear design of the phone while adding some protection. The only downside to this case is that its hard to keep the back clear of dust and it scratches very easy. After only 2 days its already scratched from only minor use. Other than that the fitment is great and everything seems very precise.
Overall I am very happy with this Iphone 5 case. I love that it has a clear back so I can see the sleek back of the iphone instead of a bulky case. It is all pretty thin, but the surrounding bumper protects the case well from falls. The only downside is that dust sometimes gathers in the back and you can see it through the clear side. I feel like if you don't clean it out often, sand or hard particles that are stuck impressed on the back and scratched the matted part of the phone a little. They are just tiny dots though so it is not very noticeable. Also the scratches on the clear side of the case aren't noticeable when it is on the phone, especially a black phone I think. It was fairly inexpensive and does its job protecting the phone. Just make sure to clean out dust in the back, but it is nice being able to see the back of the phone.
I returned this case after about 5 days. The clear back gets alot of dust inside of it and it scratches very very easy. Made the beautiful new iPhone 5 look like it was in poor condition. I am much happier with my exchange. The Belkin Candy Sheer (Lime) Read my review on it.
This case is awesome, its great because it doesn't add any bulkyness to the iPhone yet it does a great job to keep it protected. Yes the back has become a harbor for dust but I'll take the dust any day over scratches. The back is a clear side so whether you have the white or black iPhone 5, you can still show that color off with this case. The blue grip is a nice touch as it acts as a bumper case at the same time.
I like this case! I like that you can see the back but its still covered at the same time. It does get dust and stuff in it easily but that does not bother me I rather have it protected and have dust then no protection. Now the blue is a little different its bright blue but a matte finish not sure I like it but its OK
I highly recommend this for someone who is looking for light weight case. The cut outs, especially in the bottom make it easy to use the Lightning Adapter for the iPhone. Does not add any significant bulk to the phone. Highly recommended.
Nice cover for iphone 5, does not make phone look bulky. Protects the phones finish. Looks better than all other cases.
I wanted a thin and light case that was white to match my phone. After just one month the case has started to turn black from being touched and taken in and out of my pocket. I tried to bleach it to no avail and now plan to return it.
Discoloring totally sucked. Definitely wouldn't recommend.
After about 3 days of having this case on, it immediately started turning yellow and getting dingy. I always keep my hands clean and do not work on cars so I don't know why it turned dirty so fast. I returned on day 4.
Case feels good and seems to be slip resistant and also protects well but the white case got dirty very quick and won't clean up even with Mr Clean Magic Eraser.
I've had this case since the iphone 5 came out and the back is not really transparent anymore. scratches everywhere and the case gets filled with dust and dirts very fast. The white border is just a nightmare. It turns yellow brown very fast, even if you was your hands all the time... I tried cleaning it with soap, dishwashing liquid, even 90 degrees rubbing alcohol but nothing make it clean and white again. Grey or black would probably be a better option... The protection is a little weak on the front borders.
I bought this case because I wanted to keep my white iPhone 5's "naked" appearance as much as possible, so the white case and transparent back were perfect. Immediately after I put it on I saw there were scuffs and scratches on the plastic back and debri had gotten into the case, even though I had ever so carefully cleaned it and put it on. Fine, not a huge deal, at least it was protecting my actual phone from getting scratched. After a few days on the white rubber started turning yellow from being in a procket in my purse, and now 2 weeks later it's so disgusting that I'm embarrassed to have it on my phone. So much for protecting my iPhone while keeping it looking nice!
I bought this case because it was white and sleek and looked great with the white iPhone 5. After 3 or 4 days of regular use, the back was all scratched and the white rubber became yellowish. I tried cleaning it and that didn't help. I figured the white rubber would discolor over time, but not 4 days. I have an Otterbox now. Don't buy this case.
Since I'm clumsy and drop my phone, I needed a case to cover my white iPhone 5. This was see-thru in the back, so that was a plus. But after 2 weeks of taking it in and out of my pocket. the rubber quickly absorbed whatever was on my hands, and took on a brownish hue on the edges. For $30, I expected this would last much longer. I didn't think i needed to wear gloves to avoid dirtying the case. Took this one back.
I've had this case for just over a week now. It looked great when it was new! After three days or so, I started to notice discoloration and scratching. But this wasn't just any scratching...the clear back scratches from the inside! I'm not rock climbing or anything, and my phone spends almost its entire life in the pocket of my jeans. The white edges of this phone have become an ugly brown, with some black marks mixed in. There is no way it's worth $29.99...$10 MAYBE. This product is absolute trash!
The case looks great in the store. Mine started turning blue around the corners from putting it in/ taking it out of my jeans pocket. Black border one would probably be better. Back scratches easy too.
I bought this case 2 days ago. I have never had the phone in the same pocket as keys or loose change, yet the clear back plastic was all scratched up within the first 12 hours of owning it. You can literally leave a permanent scratch in the clear plastic with your fingernail. The rubber edge grip is very sleak, as is the entire case. I tried it on in the store and it looked amazing. Unfortunately after a few days, the white is now yellow. I played a lot of game on it, so maybe average use turns it white in 4 or 5 days instead of 2. I have already seen other reviews say ONE day, so I would steer clear of the white at all costs, and probably the black and blue thanks to the easily scratched clear plastic as well. I will be returning this tonight.
Bought it because it looked nice and clean. Got dirty in a day definitely not what I expected. Returning for the black/clear.
Simply installing the phone into this case can cause scratches on the inside of the clear back portion. The scratches look like frosted plastic marks. I find the front lip of the case to be a bit too tall and wish it was rounder. The white rubber edging can get dirty, which I suppose is expected given the color and material.
Only had it for a day. Should have believed the other reviews. Save your money, there are plenty more out there now. I just needed something quick, and the selection was very limited then.
This case looks good at first but then it gets a few scratches on the clear back and looks bad. It also lets a lot of dust and debris inside the case.
Bought the case when the IPHONE 5 came out. The case looked nice. After a week, the case had all these scratches on it and it looked terrible. Then I took it to clean it and notice a little piece of rock was stuck on the case. Ended up scratching my phone. Since then, Ive put on an Invisashield on the back of the phone. Waste of money and time.
Not a good case. Looks very nice in the box, but 2 days later it looks like it has fallen off a cliff. I am VERY careful with my gadgets, and the clear plastic scratches very easily. There is also a lot of dust that gets trapped behind the clear plastic. The case is also pretty bulky. I ended up with a belkin candy sheer
Loved my bumper on my iPhone 4... Thought this would be similar. This allows TOO many scratches on the back!!! Very disappointed! I have lots of scratched on the back of a beautiful phone!
This provides my phone with good protection, but the back is clear and it gets scratched and spotted with weird stains and oils. Leaves a very poor look. Other than that it looks real nice, light, and serves its function.
This case is superlative in almost every way. Granted, it's not a case for the clumsy layperson, as its not as durable as, say, an otter box. This case looks great. I've had it for a month and still receive compliments on how good my phone looks. It barely increases the size of the phone, and protects it as much as the next case. Great buy.
DO NOT BUY THIS CASE. I had bought this case going against all the reviews that the case's back scratches easily because I really didn't care too much and figured better than my phone - plus I thought most people were over exaggerating. They were not - just sliding the phone into this case scratched the plastic backing. The biggest problem was that the case SCRATCHED MY PHONE. The plastic when it scratches clumps up and forms a rough surface, and with the iPhone 5 and its very delicate aluminum back its the perfect storm for messing up your phone - this case scratched the back of my phone just by putting the case on. Horrible product this company should stop making these cases - and I kinda wish they would be held accountable for selling such garbage. The point of a case is to protect your phone, not scratch it. DO NOT BUY UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE.
I bought this for my iphone 5, Iphone 5 also has adapters for their new connector. The adapter I got from apple wont sit in the dock correctly because of where the rubber is near the dock. Badly designed.
The back scratches easier than the actual phone! It looks bad within two weeks.
Just like all the other reviews say, this case is a joke. Although it's meant to protect the phone from scratches, it causes different damage on it's own. After just a few days of owning this I noticed the clear portion of the case had started looking horrible. After taking the case off to clean it I noticed there were marks embedded onto the back of the phone itself. Likely some small dust particle getting between the back of the phone and the inside of the case. Griffin really didn't think it through on this one and I hate this case. Do NOT buy it.
I bought this case after hearing how the iphone5's aluminum backing gets easily scratched. This case was an easy choice for me because it did not take away from the appearance of the iphone at all. Do not be fooled, though. The case looks perfect while in the packaging but when you take it out of the packaging it will most likely have scuff marks on the clear plastic backing. This was not a problem for me though (considering how it was just the case and it would eventually get scratched anyway). The problem for me was that the hard plastic backing would press against any hard material, that would find it's way into the case, against the back of the phone and cause 'dot) scratches. I call them this because they looks as if a smudge is on the phone (like a dot) but when you try to remove/clean them, you realize they are scratches. It isn't too bad because you can't see them unless you're looking looking for them, but none-the-less, they are there. The entire purpose of the case, which is to protect the phone from being damaged in anyway, was defeated. you'll be better off getting a case that has a rubber/micro-fiber lining on the inside, and a hard-shell outside.
This case is perfect for those who want to show off their awesome iPhone 5 and protect it at the same time. Throw a zagg HD shield on the screen and your phone is good to go. It's not the most rugged, but it will protect it from surface scratches and short drops. Sweet case!
The case provides a nice grasp of the phone and doesn't hide too much but it scratches easily. I'm only on day 2 and it looks horrid. As soon as I took it out, the cardboard packaging scratched the inner side of the case and now there's a huge scrape on it. Don't waste your money.
I bought this case as soon as I got my iPhone 5. I wanted immediate protection and good looks as well. This case seemed to be the answer; however, I removed the case today to clean it and there was debris that was wedged between the backing and my phone. Because of the debris getting in, the back of my phone now has little scratches all over. Never buying anything from Griffin again.
This is my second Belkin case, I had one on my iPhone 4, and now on my iPhone 5. These are the most similar to the Apple bumpers that I've found. I like they they show the beauty of the phone, and the rubber edges give a little protection if dropped and keep it from sliding around on surfaces like in the car, but still the case has a slim profile. I don't like the big bulky Otterbox, etc. cases - which the salesman told me people were waiting for. This isn't going to protect the phone if it's dropped in water, sure, but that's what AppleCare+ or a SquareTrade warranty is for.
I bought this case because I loved the owl design, but it did not even fit on the iphone 5. It was too small and would have broken if I had tried any harder to get it on the phone. I had to return it. Still searching for the perfect case.
This is not a bad case. Only wish it maybe covered a bit more of the phone around the edges.
I read the previous post, and I haven't had any of the problems that they experienced. I'm looking at the box right now, and it doesn't say it has a screen protector, but it does say "beveled edge protects screen on any flat surface". Very nice finish, and fits very nicely around the iPhone5. It has a velvety inside which seems to make it fit tightly. The two pieces fit together using compression, and seems to work well. I like that that it still maintains a relatively slim design (unlike the Otter products that are built for a jungle expedition). I just bought the item, so i don't have any experience with how well the durability is (so i gave it a raking of 4 stars).
I talked to a customer service rep about correcting the product information so it may already be corrected when you read this, but I bought this case thinking there would be a screen protector (as incorrectly stated within the product feature section). I opened the package to only find the case alone so please note this before purchasing.
This is a nice case for the early releases of cases for the IPHONE 5. It feels and looks durable. Easy to put on and take off the case. I've dropped my phone a couple of times and fortunately, this case has absorbed the impact quite nicely. I wish it had a kick stand so I can sit and stream stuff when I have down time.
This case is sleek and pretty comfortable to hold. The only downside is it seems a little flimsy.
The red and black color really complement the white iPhone, easy to install and has a nice texture finish, overall built looks durable.
I had this case for my iPhone 3GS, which I used for about four years. It looked almost new when I gave it to my son a month ago after buying the iPhone 5. I did a lot of research about cases for my new phone but could not find one I liked as much as my old one. I was thrilled to see they made one to fit the iPhone 5. The two-toned red/black is really nice. The case has a finish that is not slick, but not super rough either. It makes it really comfortable to hold. I really love this case.
This case is great, easy to install, and remove if needed. Looks good on the iPhone, feels good when held, good value.
I knew the size and shape of the Otterbox so I knew what to expect. Price is high so I am expecting a lot over the long haul of this iPhone case. Some of the buttons require very firm pressing and occasionally do not respond to initial presses.
Previous models of the otter box had some protection over the mics and speakers. I miss those. Otherwise the best phone protection on the market for the price.
Otterbox managed to improve an already awesome case with this one. It blows the Lifeproof case out of the water.
Best cover for the iPhone . This version is better than iPhone 4. Love it!!!
The otterbox does protect phone better than anything else out there. The screen protector has a small space between it and the screen which causes your touch screen to be less responsive. The case is also a little bit long for the phone, which enables it to move up or down just a little inside the case. Also, if you use the belt clip, mine started to scar up the rubber on case from snapping it in and out of the belt clip. If you are looking for the best protection available for your phone you may be able to live with these small issues.
Great case, worth the money. I would definitely recommend it to anyone wanting a really protective case. It's already saved my phone at least once.
It completely protects my phone, screen and all. I love it!!
Case is nice and hard nothing will danage phone. High price, needs to be lower.
I bought this when I got my phone because I work outdoors and need to have my phone on me at all times. It's professional and comes with a belt clip that is durable as well. I remove the case during my weekends which can be tiresome but I can't keep my phone in this case because it's just too bulky for everyday life. I also connect the phone to my car and when I have to access the connectors it can be annoying because the connector cover area can be tough to open at times. But if you work outdoors and need a good protective case this is the one to get.
I have tested this product several times with drops and my iPhone 5 still is surviving. Thankfully!
Good clean look. Gives good solid feel. Though rarely if ever needed, is difficult to remove.
It's the best product for an iPhone for the money.
I had an otterbox for my iPhone 4 the design was bulky and the outer case was very pliable. The protection on the other hand was amazing. I dropped it many times (once from about 15') and it never damaged the phone. The outer case on the iPhone 5 is a lot better than the floppy silicone on it it's predecessor. My issues are with the design. Like all other iPhone 5 accessories that were released at the time of the phone release....well lets just say it all seems a little rushed. - The opening on the ear piece and camera lens has no protection at all. This would be fine if I could fit a zagg protector on the phone but the tolerances are too tight for that. - The flaps on the bottom for the headphone jack and lightning cable, open down and to the back of the phone. This may seem like no big deal but for use in the car, for say music (or any other function like apple maps) the case has to sit cockeyed unless you place it face down (which defeats the purpose for apple maps). I am a service technician that works with petroleum products and out of a vehicle. So It gets kind of annoying to have to buy an extra accessory to prop it up to not damage the bottom flaps overtime. Other than the above stated everything is tip-top. My last otterbox kept my iPhone at near unused condition. This one on the other hand, will look a little beat up around the mentioned areas. And unless I can figure something out, I will be stuck taking it apart weekly and cleaning all the junk from the week out of it. It does the job of keeping my phone in one piece. But to me it's the little things that make a product stand out. Otherwise it would have had 5 stars.
This is the best case I've ever had. It's very durable and I dropped my phone from 10 flights of stairs and my phone and case was in perfect conditions. From now n I will only buy Outterbox Defender cases - you won't go wrong.
This is an impressively strong case. I like the feel of the rubberized outer skin and the strength of the polycarbonate. The unit presents visually as strong and practical. The down side is the screen protector, which is adequately strong, but which leaves a small air space between protector and screen that lessens the brightness of the screen and causes the screen to be less sensitive. I simply removed the Otter screen cover and installed an invisibleShield on the screen, and I could hardly be more pleased with the result. Stunning.
This is the best case I've bought thus far. It protects my phone from the back side to the front. It allows for a cover over my screen to protect the display.
Since my iPhone 3G, I've been a heavy believer in the OtterBox. Three phones later, the OtterBox has protected each iPhone and an iPad from multiple drops, three kids and even a few light spills. The iPhone 5 case is as sturdy as the others, but unfortunately it lacks in the looks department. Gone is the ridged, rubber shell, and the option for the color red. Now it's a solid rubber coating with several offbeat colors available. But to me, protection is more important than appearance. And the new OtterBox serves its purpose.
This is the best case that offers your phone protection in 3 ways silicon protection and screen protection and clip holder
As soon as these were available I ordered one for my iPhone 5. I have had an Otter Box for every iPhone I've had and this one does not disappoint in the protection department. But, it does NOT work with the 30 pin to Lightning adapter. Its a great case other than that.
Because The iPhone was just release the manufacter had to guess at size and location. Large areas around camera and other external parts should be redesigned soon.
Overall I am satisfied with this case but the only complaint I have is that the end of my Beats Audio headphone cable that plugs in the device will not fit. The case is designed more for a straight connection and not one that is at 90 degrees. I have sent an email to Otterbox and have not heard back.
Previously owned OtterBox Defender case with iphone4 and was very satisfied. Decided to buy another when I upgraded to the iphone5. Great product.
Love the camera lens area redesign compared to the i phone 4 version. it is very rugged i use it with out the holster the iphone 5 is to big for holstering in my opinion.
This is an excellent case for your iPhone 5! They have made a lot of improvements from the 4/4s cases. It's still not quite as tough as the cases for the 3 but there has to be balance between safety and style.
I've had the Defender series on my iPhone 4, 4s and now the 5. This case will help protect your investment like no other case. I work in landscaping, my phone would not have survived had it not been for the otterbox defender series case, I mean come on this case is dust proof, crush proof, water resistant (not water proof, but they are working on the armor series case which is) and so much more. Some complain that the phone is too light, with this case it makes the phone feel perfect IMO. Getting the rubber case off the shell is a slight pain but its because its a perfect fit, no sliding around, and if you do happen to accidentally rip the rubber- otterbox will replace it for you. This is the BEST CASE PEROID well untill the armor series comes out :)
It looks great and does its protection job quite well, but it is bulky.
This is my first "Otterbox case Defender" I gotta say this case is really made well (not sure why the other guy was having problems) but, based on my removal of the case experience Ive had no rips or tears. The outer rubber shell is really durable its thick great grip on the hands. The inner plastic shell is hard to remove takes time once its off you will notice theres a rear soft foam that protects the back of your iphone 5 which i really like. Also the built in screen protector is cool it doesnt watermark your screen whatsoever. iphone fits snug no extra movement whatsoever perfect fit and protection. I suggest you clean the iphone really good especially the screen and under the screen protector so there is no lint or unwanted debris when you do put the case on. I dont see any reason to keep taking off and on the case do it once leave it in there and forget it till you really need to take it off.
I thought this case would be perfect for my phone but I ended up returning it after a couple weeks since I got so irritated off having to take it apart and cleaning the cheap screen protector or the rainbows I would be getting every couple of days. It was not worth the headache. I ended up switching to the commuter case. I was also expecting this case to be white and pink but it is actually pink and cream which looks really nasty on my white iphone5.
I work in the petro-chemical service industry and I am very hard on my iPhone. It's been dropped at lest 20 ft and has fallen on very hot surfaces and has protected my phone perfectly. I can take the phone out of the case and there is not a scratch on it.
This case has a pretty color on the back. the rim is green and really looks plastic. I still was ok with it, till i dropped it the first time. Took a chunk out of the corner. phone survived the fall, but the case is going back. I think it's worth about $5.99. will probably go with the otterbox.
This case looks sturdy, but the colors on the unit I received were murky and not at all vibrant like what is represented on the website. The green from the peacock feather (as seen in photo) is a light gray on the finished product, and is screened on at like 50%, so it doesn't even look like a peacock feather. Looks more like a giant polka dot toward the top of an orange and pink iPhone case. I returned it immediately.
While I've been fortunate and not dropped my phone up to this point, I'm not certain how the case would perform in a "protective" role. While the case fits well, easily snaps on, is snug and from the back, is attractive, the lime green plastic in which the design is adhered to doesn't appeal to me. It shows very clearly around the face of the phone. Would prefer a more finished look. It does appears as if it might serve well in an accidental dropping situation ... just what I think from looking at and handling the phone with the case on. Appears durable and seems to be somewhat scratch resistant, but given enough force the plastic will likely scratch.
I got this the first day the phones came out. The pattern is definitely one of a kind and was what drew me to it. I mainly needed something to cover right away so i decided to try this out. the feel is very sleek and slippery, it has already slipped through my hands in my car before. It's nice to look at but I don't feel like my phone would survive a fall unless on carpet. Oh and another important thing, i already have a small nick on my aluminum part of the phone and i have never even taken it out of the case till recently only to find that! Very disappointed to see that. Needless to say I will probably shop for something that offers more protection.
Greatproduct and I know my iphone is protected. Has one on my Iphone4 for several years and the phone was totally protected and with in "living" inside my purse where it would surely be damaged with all of the "things" inside. I purchased another for my new iphone5 and notice they have improved the Otterbos considerably as if doesnt stick to everything like when you try to put it into your pocket
i love my iPhone 5 case. there are some cuter ones perhaps with other brands but i never worry about my phone being protected or my screen getting messed up. it gives me complete peace of mind and i love that. i will always use otterbox <3
Great starter case for someone that wants their new phone protected from scratches and or damage resulting from dropping the phone.
Good over all protection. Case frame very close to keyboard...may cause mistypes.
excellent quality, great value for the price, i will recommend this product
I believe that the Cover is great for the Iphone. I however do not like that I have already lost the holster off of my belt and can't seem to find another one for it.
As I walked pass the color stood out. Had to try it on, which led to me purchasing it. It's a but bulky, but what could you expect with such protection.
The phone case is wonderful other than it getting dirty really easily. It keeps my phone looking stylish and sleek. Also, I have gotten a number of compliments on it.
I bought this case for my phone and I put it on, it does a good job of protecting him the front and the back, not like an OtterBox though, I know this is not Suppose to be a imposter of the OtterBox or the Griffin military like cases, But in any event they are good cases but I got this one and in one day of phone usage and I'm a high school student so I use my phone a lot. I noticed the case got very dingy, not overly dirty, but you could see that the case was getting dirty from normal use, but overall, the sleep/wake button is a little hard to press and so are the volume buttons, but other than that it's a good case.
If you want a lightweight, durable, and useful case, this is the perfect option. I was a bit skeptical when I first got the case, as the hard shell version of it scratched my iPhone when I removed it. However, this case is better in every possible way. First of all, the color looks awesome with the white iPhone. The colors almost seem like they were meant to go together. Next, this case is incredibly easy to install remove and does not damage the fragile iPhone 5 in any way during the process. The case also just feels perfect in your hand. It has enough texture to offer the perfect grip, but it isn't cheap-looking or feeling silicon by any means. I am fully convinced that, with the Zagg shield, this case offers just as much protection as the Otterbox Commuter, but at half the price! The volume buttons are covered on this case, and there are separate sections on the bottom for the speakers, charging port, and headphone jack instead of just one big opening. The only thing I would change about this case is the covering for the back camera, which I fear could get scratched pretty easily. However, I am planning on installing a Zagg shield on the back of my phone as well, so I think that will reduce that issue. Overall, this case is great. It's not flashy like the Otterbox or military tough like the Griffin Survivor, but for those who want to protect their iPhone 5 without spending $50 and adding a lot of bulk, this case truly is the best of all worlds.
I love this cover as it allows the beauty of the Iphone 5 to be seen clearly and offers great protection at a great price! Thanks.
Great product, got my iPhone 5 on day one and was looking for a case (didn't want to scratch it, and the Apple Stores still do not have cases). The thing feels great in hands, is sturdy, and "illuminates" when Flash alerts are turned on. The only downside (very very very slight) is that dirt sometimes slip under the case. This thing, however, happens with every other cases out there. GREAT case, possibly one of the best I've owned-do not hesitate.
Wanted something with a reasonable cost to show off and protect my new iPhone 5. Being clear (ish) this fits the bill. Even they guy at the Apple Store liked it. :)
I got this case as a temporary solution to protect my new iPhone 5 until the case of my choice comes out. It is working fine and gives the protection I need, but as soon as the Twelve South Book Book comes out for the iPhone 5 I will be getting that. I had one for my iPhone 4 and I loved it and cannot live without it now.
This is the case I have been waiting for. It's clear to show off the beauty of the iPhone. It is slim and form fitting, not bulky nor heavy. The only thing I don't like is that it is curved on the edges, you can't stand the phone on its side without help.
Feels comfortable, is light, is perfect and the most important thing PROTECT MY iPhone, I tested and it worked great.
I am also a case snob! I really liked the idea of a clear case for my new phone. I had testing this case in black in the store and really liked the fit. So I ordered the clear online for in-store pickup. As someone else mentioned, the feel and fit of the clear is totally different from the color cases. The comparison to jelly shoes is right on. The fit is pretty decent, although bulges a little on the top and bottom. The back doesn't look so bad, and the "watermarking" look is slight. I haven't had any problems with lint showing through. My big problems with the case are the sharp edges that others have noticed. I don't feel it much with the phone upright. But it really hurts when I turn it sideways, and particularly playing games. If I were to keep this case, I would definitely try to shave off this ridge. Also a clear rubber case just does NOT look good on the top or sides of the black phone. It ends up looking really cheap. It actually looks like the phone is in some plastic packaging that I haven't taken off yet. Maybe this is not as noticeable on the white phone. I do still like the clear back, so my next step will be the black/clear combo cases. Rocketfish has one (I've already ordered it) and Griffin has one.
An OK temporary case while you wait for companies to design to iPhone 5' size specifications. Aesthetically, this is a nice clear TPU case. However, the two rough seams along the edge of the case makes it feel uncomfortable to hold. The poor fit causes watermarks and lint to get trapped in between the case and phone also. I returned this case the next day.
This case really is a good looking product on your phone. A lot of people bought iphone 5 for the light weight and sleek thin look. This case keeps the thin appeal and shows off the great look. The case seems pretty sturdy to be so thin, but I am still concerned if it will protect thoroughly if dropped. All of the edges on the front overlap for good scratch resistance but the top and bottom feel a little less tight than the sides. All in all a good case for the money.
Bought this for myself, but ended up giving it to my daughter because she wanted it. Love the way you can see through to the back of the phone. There was one area that showed a watermark like the other reviewer said, but it's very minor in my opinions. I didn't personally like this same case in other colors, because the material is different, and it's harder to press the lock button.
So far happy with the case. Material is a stiff rubbery, silicone type material, software than plastic but much stiffer than silicone. Clear is great for my new white iPhone 5. The back and sides look great. The edge makes the phone look sort of cheap plastic, but I don't think there's a better approach to try and see as much of the phone as possible. I like the lip around the screen. When I put the phone down, its not resting on the glass.
Love the look, feel, and protection this case offers. But, it causes major watermarking. I have a black iPhone 5 and it makes the back look ugly with all the watermarks. I will return and try another in store, if second case causes watermarking I'll be looking for a different case.
This is my second . The 1 st one kept my old iphone in pristine condition. when I traded it in it was in "out of the box" condition
Attractive, easy to access all areas of phone with great protection at the same time. Do not need those peel and stick screen covers, this has a clear cover that goes over your screen.
This is a far cry from a lifecase but does the job until the latter ships. Once Lifecase for iPhone 5 is available. Otterbox is finished.
I really like this product. I wish the phone was this easy and reliable.
Model for IPhone 5 does not seem as tough. Also was disappointed that Night Sky Blue was only choice in Defender style at time of my purchase. I wanted to protect my phone from time of purchase but wanted a brighter color choice. A brighter color cover makes phone easier to locate in purse or carrier. Do not want to spend more $$ just to replace for color. Also finding cover already showing wear and its been only about 6 weeks. Had Defender on previous IPhone and it lasted 3years without wear. Also notice this model has problems with humidity under screen between cover and phone which I had no issues with before.
If you are looking for a nice temporary averagely priced iphone 5 case and still thinking if you're going for the minimalist style case or the thick lifeproof/otterbox cases, this may be the right case for you. It's not too thin nor too thick. It does serve it's purpose of protecting your phone from short drops because it is minimally shockproof, its not waterproof and doesn't come with a screen protector, although the protruding front lips does offer some protection. It is made of rubber so you do have that rubbery feel which kinda helps it not slip from your hand. I do however recommend that you buy a screen protector.
Great case minimalist soft case...and I'm an iPhone case snob. Protects iPhone without overdoing it with the bulk of many other cases. The lip on the front does a nice job protecting the screen when placing the phone face down.
Needed a simple case to cover my iphone 5. This works perfectly. I wanted to keep phone naked but there are reports of them easily being scratched. Mine came with slight nick in the black out of box and there are reports of this being a common issue. Rather than returning phone and getting one that is worse , I opted to cover it to help my OCD until apple gets the issue fixed. This case adds very little bulk and feels secure.
I have never liked the hard shell cases, so when I recently purchased the iPhone 5, I was pleasantly surprised to find a soft shell case. This case is very high quality, and has openings on the bottom for the speakers and lightning cable and on the side for the silent switch. There are molded buttons on the side for the volume and on top for the lock switch. This case feels great in your hand and gives the iPhone 5 a more rugged feel, but at the same time it complements the slim features of the phone perfectly. My only complaints - the case is hard to install because it isn't as flexible as you might think it is and the opening on the back for the camera and flash is a little too large and it lets part of the metal backing of the iPhone 5 show through - the opening could be a tad bit smaller to only let the glass band at the top of the phone show.
If you want to keep your new hardware safe, I recommend keeping it in a case, and my favorite rugged case is the Otterbox. If you don't want a bulky case, it's not for you. If you want fantastic protection with a lifetime warranty (on the case, not the phone) you can't beat Otterbox. I have used Otterbox Cases on all of my previous phones, and when I went to sell/trade them in, they came out of the case looking brand new, no scratches, no dings, not a mark on them. In each time the phone held its top potential value for resale and therefore paid for the cost of the Otterbox case.
I'm still trying to decide how I feel about this case, but here are some of my first impressions: It's a gorgeous color combination and really adds to the overall look of the already-beautiful iPhone 5. The polycarbonate shell also seems more sturdy and of a higher quality than the Defender case for the iPhone 4S, and the silicon cover feels more like a "foam" than the silicon for the previous model, which I think is a good thing. I feel like I have a good grip when I'm holding the otherwise-fragile phone, but the case doesn't seem like it would stick to my pockets or anything. However, there are a few downsides: The openings for the front and rear cameras are a bit too "wide open" for my tastes and I'm worried about the aluminum getting scratched since part of it is exposed in the back camera opening. I just ordered a full body Zagg shield today and will be putting screen covers on the front and back of the phone for additional protection because the aluminum scratches so easily. There is also an air bubble between the screen protector and the iPhone glass, making the touchscreen not quite as responsive. It still works, but it's a bit more of a pain to type. Overall, I like this case. It offers decent protection and looks awesome, though I do think it's overpriced for what you get. However, unlike some other cases, you can rest assured that this case will NOT scratch your phone in any way during installation and removal.
Excellent for the money, tough and sleek and doesn't add Much over all weight to the phone at all. Looks Better on the iPhone 5 than the older model cases Did. Can't beat it. I actually liked this series of Otterbox So much I purchased one for my new iPad as well!
The screen protection is a complete joke. I bought this case because I needed something that had a durable shell and a good screen protector. Thought I was smart in saving ten bucks. If you are going to spend $40 bucks go ahead and spend ten more dollars and buy the defender. I put the screen protector on as instructed and within hours I have bubbles forming and it is already peeling off. Not happy at all.
I bought this case because I wanted a no-frills phone case that would protect my phone, not add too much bulk and not look ridiculous. This case fits the bill on all three counts. It's very easy to install your phone (yes even for non-techy types!) and seems to protect the phone extremely well. Yes, it does add a bit of bulk to the very sleek and slim iPhone 5, but that's a small price to pay in order to insure the phone is safe in case of accident. It comes in different colors, but I bought the black, which I found blended in nicely with the color of the phone. This seems to be the ideal case--- not as flimsy as many of the silicone sleeves are, and not as much "overkill" as the Otterbox "Defender" series.
Case is perfect not to bulky and its durable I would recommend a better screen protector
New design leaves very thin line of silicone across face on both top ad bottom which sometimes gets caught under harder plastic part of case. Also, on/off button on top is hard to press.
Both me and my fiance purchased the Iphone 5 and as soon as we did we purchased the commuter case, mine black hers pink and white not that color really matters. Both of us have taken our phone out and put them back in to clean the inside of the case and have had no problem with breaking them, its pretty simple if the way your trying to get the case off isn't working don't force it and it wont break aka don't be stupid. Next I have no idea what this guy is talking about "The Apple lightning adapter will not plug in to the bottom of the phone because it cannot reach through the opening. Seems like a pretty big design flaw. Since most people will not be willing to remove a case like this every day, this basically makes the case unusable." obviously he cant find the flap at the bottom of the phone that is there so you can plug your phone in.... I don't know people amaze me. Moving on, I have dropped the phone twice but not from very high up nor on a very hard surface but still the phone nor the case was damaged. If you are in a very physical job, known for being hard on phones, or maybe even a little clumsy you know happens to all of us this case isn't for you look into the Defender. But if your work is the opposite or if your just really cautious of your phone this case this work just fine for you.
When I got the iphone5 I wanted a case that would protect the phone and not be super bulky. This case fits the bill perfectly. I have dropped my phone twice while trying to put it in my pocket and both times the case has done its job. If you want solid otterbox protection AND less bulk this case meets the expectations.
This is my second otterbox product the Defender case was just a little to big.
The cover looks good and I think it does a good job of protecting the phone. However, there is one MAJOR issue. The Apple lightning adapter will not plug in to the bottom of the phone because it cannot reach through the opening. Seems like a pretty big design flaw. Since most people will not be willing to remove a case like this every day, this basically makes the case unusable. One other issue is that mine appears to be slightly warped. It doesn't lay completely flat on a flat surface.
The case feels nice, good fit, and secure. However just like previous versions of the commuter case, the covers don't stay "closed" when they should, everytime I go to reach for my phone the cover is opened and gets really annoying. This seems to be classic amongst most of the otterbox family that I've owned before. If you don't mind that, it's great, if you do, find something else!
This case has a great fit and medium to high level of protection , it's not as bulky as the defender series and fits well in my front pocket , I don't wear skinny jeans... Lol. There's a lot of cases out there and this phone is gorgeous so cover it with this attractive one. I didn't bother with the added screen protector it seems to rigid, I always buy zagg since its hard to scratch.
I bought the OtterBox and picked it up in-store the day after I received my iPhone since I heard the back can scratch easily and didn't want to wait for the case to be shipped. I do have to say this case does look like it can take a licking. The phone fits snug into the case and doesn't feel like it would fall out if dropped. While I do not feel like testing the limits of abuse this case can take, it has held up very well to everyday use and removed my worry about scratching the phone when i put it down somewhere or any other everyday hazard. Only issue seems to be the screen protector. I was able to apply it well if I do say so myself, but it left the cloudy look on the bottom edge of the phone that won't go away even with a credit card or using their edger. The good news though is the case covers the edge, so I don't see it when using it, but it may be a nuisance for some to know it's there. I do have the feeling I will be replacing the shield sooner rather than later so you may want to invest in shield you're confident in now rather than use theirs. Overall, definitely worth the investment if you want to keep your phone in good shape, especially when it comes time to resell for your new upgrade in the future.
As expected the OtterBox case itself is amazing. Slim figure, durable,good price. But the screen protector was a waste of plastic. Who ever designed it was not thinking clearly. They put a sticker to instal it easier but when the screen protector was on the phone the sticker didn't peel off and left the sticky reside. For that price I expect the whole package. I will be sticking with PowerSupportUSA for all my screen protector needs.
I was a little skeptical buying this case because it said for "new iPhone" not iPhone 5 but I was surprise it fit perfectly. It comes with free screen protector. The only thing I don't like about the case it is a little slick meaning there is not much grip but this is fine since I feel like the case is very protective. I would be fine if I drop it. Definitely the best case for iPhone 5 until the life proof comes out.
It's a decent cover. It does what it has to do. It's been durable so far.
I really like this case. I like the way it feels and the fact that it's slim and light. It probably doesn't provide as much protection as one of the bulkier and heavier cases, but it's easy to hold and fits great in my purse or my pocket.
The case itself is of a good quality. It is soft touch material all around and all access ports have plenty of room. I also enjoy the fact that it isn't too thick making the phone bigger. The problem is after just a week and a half of use, (I got my iPhone 5 on launch day and I put it into a case right away) the black anodized paint is scratching off of the corners where the case is applying the most pressure, revealing the shiny silver underneath. If you have the white iPhone 5 then this won't be a problem. Just a warning for those who have the black one.
This case is a good idea but very poor fitment quality! I don't recommend this case until they fix the cover fitting flush to the screen. The otter box blows this case as of now.
I had a Lifeproof case for my 4S and absolutely fell in love with it. I recommended it to many people(some bought one for themselves). Like everyone that bought a 5 and wanted a Lifeproof, I waited patiently for them to create them because I felt like they were making it perfect the 1st go-round and not just pushing them out ASAP. So they finally are available and I buy one. They look GREAT and the water-proofness has worked great. However, the sound quality is horrible on this case. The 4S case sounded good. I am also getting the beeping noise that others have written about in their reviews. However, my biggest complaint is that when I pull the phone away from my ear, the screen doesn't come out of dark mode like it normally would, making me unable to hang up the phone. Agh!
Was thrilled to be able to finally get my hand on one. But after using it, did not like how the sound was being distorted.
I, like a lot of others, eagerly awaited the arrival of my Lifeproof Case for my brand new iPhone 5. The marketing by the folks at Lifeproof is great. Unfortunately, the product doesn't live up to the hype. While it does look great and offer a superior level of protection, it does come at a cost. I cannot tell you how annoying it is to hear the "beep" that happens during calls. It is intermittent and the person on the other end of the call can't hear it, but I find my self missing parts of the conversation due to the noise. Also, I cannot use speaker phone due to the fact that the person I am talking to says they can hear themselves as they talk. The speakers sound terrible with a noticeable vibration at higher volume. Also, the screen protector is loose and kind of bubbles up. This makes the multi-touch interface of the iPhone 5 VERY multi-touch; meaning that you have to tap multiple times or very hard in order to get the phone to respond. If you want maximum protection with minimum phone performance, then buy the Lifeproof Case. If the performance of your iPhone is most important, look elsewhere for protection. I know I am.
I love my lifeproof. I had one for the iPhone 4, and now I have it for the iPhone 5. It's amazing to be able to swim with the iPhone, and have durable protection that rivals an otterbox with a fraction of the thickness.
At first i wasn't that convinced because the screen was not fully accessible due to the Speaker components on the top part. But with some use its Great! It had like rainbow colored rings on the screen so i went to the website and asked them about it, they said it was humidity. I had to put it on top of the air conditioner for an hour. When i got it off of the air conditioner and on my phone again only a bit of the rings were left, i haven't had time to try something else. Also the sensor next to the front facing camera doesn't work that well when you take it off of your ear during a call, and that kinda gets on my nerves but with time it gets better. I recommend you buy this if you are a clumsy person and drop it a lot! Thanks!!
I work outside, off-roading and hiking through the desert at night. My phones have been dropped, smashed (ran over by vehicles), drenched in monsoons, etc. This case is the best phone case I have found to survive all of this without being unreasonably bulky and unpleasant to use. With this said, I ONLY use this case when I work because I prefer not to have it on when I'm in my house or on the town. - Very water RESISTANT. I would never trust any case, short of putting my phone in two dry bags, and then a Pelican case, to be 'waterproof'. I don't care what the company claims- if you take any phone case swimming you are playing with fire. - Very dust/shock proof. My phone is pristine after being outside all night. Yes you lose a bit of audio and it's a tad bit annoying (only sometimes) to have to tap something twice. BUT it's the price to pay for knowing that your $$$$$$$ device is the safest that it can practicably be. So- get for outdoor adventures. Don't get to protect from coffee in your office because you will only complain about how the screen protector feels and how the audio suffers, even when it just saved your phone from your latte.
Anything that uses the speaker is respray with vibrating plastic. ( I.E. Siri, music, games, speaker phone, ringtones, alarm, texts, and movies.) It seems to me Lifeproof didn't spend enough time with product testing. I purchased one for my wife's 4S and it is fabulous. We took lots of videos under the water in the pool. They even had sound from people talking on the deck. It pains me to buy anything else, knowing how great a product this could be. They'll probably come out with the next generation for the iPhone 5 in a few months. So if you could wait, WAIT. It will probably fix everything they missed the first time. I could also mention a few other issues with blocking some of the sensors, but sound is something I think we all have in common. I'm not giving up on this company. I'll be right there buying the next one.
Best all around protection for you iPhone and can be used underwater and in the rain and snow!
I found this case to be a complete waste of money. While it was nice to have an option for a durable protective case that was not as bulky as an Otterbox Defender, Lifeproof failed at providing something with good functionality. The sound quality of the phone when in this case is awful. The case causes the phone to vibrate so loud that you can hardly hear your ringtone even when the volume is up all the way. Forget listening to radio, music, videos, they are muffled and distorted. There is significant pillowing on top and bottom of the phone. This is annoying when playing games or trying to use apps. It takes away from the quality of the screen. I also noticed some "oil slick" appearance but it wasn't too bad. The screen protector scratched really easily and takes away from the clarity of the screen. I would only recommend this case to someone working in a job that involved being around water a lot. Otherwise you may as well just put an advanced protection plan on your phone and enjoy it without a bunch of plastic blocking your way.
I have no idea what everyone is complaining about. This case is awesome. The otter box is a compete piece of junk compared to this case. This case keeps dust completely out and better yet water. The touch screen works fine as well as Sound. Just wish they were faster at getting it made. Thanks to the otter box I have rub marks where dust got into the case.
I bought the life-proof iPhone 5 case. Because i loved my 4S case. But i just returned it today because i couldn't stand when i was in some apps it wouldn't respond to stuff that i was clicking on on the sides and when i was in a call I couldn't end the call most the time because there is a big gap between the case screen and the iPhone 5 screen,and it don't tell you are trying to push it.Besides that its a very good case.
I installed my case it does exactly what it says it will, except for one critical problem, it remains permanently on silent, the button springs back to the silent position as soon as you install the case, and when you try and take it off silent still it continues to spring back to silent. As it stands right now I wouldn't recommend this case unless you don't want your phone to ever ring. I'm going to try returning it for an exchange just to see if I received a bad case. I will also be contacting LifeProof about the issue also. Hopefully it's just a bad case.
The case is a great idea, but there are a few major drawbacks which prevent the case from being usable. The back of the case vibrates when the volume of the phone is turned up causing a horrible sound. Additionally, the screen has and air gap at the top and bottom of the screen, aprox 3mm on top and 2 on the bottom. This makes it annoing to press buttons on certain apps. On the plus size, the phone feels well protected and the case passed the water leak test performed prior to installing my phone per instructions.
The case quality does not seem to justify the price. It does offer supreme protection, but that comes with a few drawbacks. The screen is not as responsive around the edges, due to the plastic membrane. The membrane also causes a plastic tapping noise whenever the screen is touched. Also, having to plug and screw in a headphone adapter is a big nuisance. Time will tell how I like the case. I will probably be using this case only when going to the beach or outdoor events when rain is a possibility. Therefore, I'll need something that allows easier access to the headphone jack.
Just picked up my LifeProof case about an hour ago and so far it measures up to the hype. Compared to the lifeproof that I had for my Iphone 4, this one may be a bit more flimsy. I don't have any intentions of going swimming or getting in the shower with my phone... I mainly just want the LifeProof case for accident purposes. I definitely like this case better than the otterbox I had previously for my iPhone 5.
Its waterproof so I don't have to worry about dropping it in the toilet, sink, or bathtub. it's impact resistant so I never worry about drops. And if I every get it dirty I can literally wash my phone in the sink without worrying.
Had a Lifeproof case for my Iphone 4s and it was great. The Lifeproof case for my iphone 5 is terrible. Sound quality is lousy. When you put the phone on speaker it would crackle and the only way to stop it is to push the back of the case against the phone. Lifeproof was in such a hurry to get this case on the market I doubt they even tested it. I'm returning mine. Otterbox is coming out with a waterproof case soon and I'm sure it will be a superior product.
I was excited to get this case, I loved my lifeproof for iphone 4s. However, this case has severe audio problems. When talking on normal calls, with the phone up to my ear, I often get an intermittent high pitch screech sound in my ear. On speakerphone callers complain of hearing their voice echo back at them and complain every time. Forget listening to music with this case. The sound is distorted at all but the quietest of volume levels. So, unless you are buying for looks only I would not recommend the lifeproof iphone5 case.
While this case does everything as advertised (waterproof, great protection), I can't get over the screen protector. It sometimes is difficult to type as the other reviews stated, but the great thing about iPhone 5 is the retina display - the screen protector really dumbs it down and doesn't give it's great picture justice. It looks like the screen on the original iPhone (pixelated, not as clear#. It bothers me, as I do take a lot of pictures. It does get annoying having to press harder around the edges, too. I also don't like that you need the headphone extender to use headphones. The 1/8" jack should be able to fit easily. That's just a design flaw. I also don't like the removable cap for the headphone jack - could be easy to lose #it comes with an extra, though, in it's defense#. If you need your case to be waterproof, then go for it. If you need something for casual everyday use, maybe look at some Otterbox's. I will be exchanging this for one myself.
After scrolling through numerous reviews I decided to at least give the case a try because I had it for my iPhone 4 and loved it. After putting it on, I received a call from a friend and the sound quality of the ringer was comparable to my first phone 10 years ago. Not only was it muffled and sounded like garbage, it wasn't loud at all ether. I put on a song after this to play it through the speakers and it too sounded terrible and even made terrible screeching noises during the highs of the song.There was also a lot of space in between the screen protecter and the phone itself which made it difficult to use the phone. The case itself also seemed like it was made cheaper and with less durable materials compared to the old cases for the 4/4s. I read on here before I purchased the case that Lifeproof "fixed" these issues with a new case that could be determined by a strip of foam above the back window instead of plastic, well this case had the foam and was still awful. Would not recommend this to anyone unless they spend a lot of time underwater.
By far the best case out there! Nothing wrong with the case!Don't believe all these bad reviews, get up, go out, and see for yourself! No disappointment guaranteed! You have nothing to lose, if your not satisfied you can RETURN the product!
the latest cases are the ones with the white foam on the back cover above the window, these latest cases solve a lot of the issues people are having, however they still need some tweaking, i have added foam to the rear cover below the window and near the bottom of the cover now the sound from the speaker is much better. the secret is you need tp keep the rear cover from vibrating so much. the only issue im experiencing is i'm getting a vibration from the ear speaker on the front cover i have not been able to resolve. for $80 lifeproof needs to keep working on these issue's they can make the case usable and prevent all the negative reviews.
I love this case. It seals the phone in great and doesn't allow dust to get in like other cases and i have purposefully jumped in my pool with the phone and it is everything as advertised. The one thing i don't like is that none of the headphones i own (beats by Dre and the earpods that come with the iphone 5) don't fit into case. The case comes with a headphone extender that you think would fit but IT DOESNT!!! thats the one drawback of the case.
I had read the prior reviews and was skeptical about buying the case, but I figured I had 30 days to try it out and could return it if it didn't live up to expectations. The case was easy to install and seems to fit snugly around the phone. All the switches and buttons work fine. The waterproof test worked as advertised. Prior reviews indicated that the users were not able to use the read 'end call' button but I have not had any problems ending calls. The only issue even close to that is that the top section of the screen is slightly elevated above the glass due to the extra waterproofing material used around the front ear piece and camera. This means that I have to apply slightly more pressure to use any controls at the top of the screen. The sound quality s slightly diminished through the speakers. I compared it side by side with a second, uncased iPhone 5 and there is a slight muffled sound through the case. However, the quality is not nearly as bad as other reviews. I have used it for speakerphone calls and it works fine. Overall, I think the case is worth the money and works as advertised. My wife and kids opted for the Otterbox Commuter case and after comparing the two, the LifeProof case is far superior is fit and protection.
I read the reviews before purchasing and was quite concerned. I purchased it anyway to see for myself. The case is very small and sleek. In fact, it seems hard to believe that a case that adds to little to the overall size can truly protect from drops. It looks great, and feels great. It slides into my pocket easily, and due to the dustproof-ness, I never have to worry about dust or lint getting into the ports . . . and keys that also are in my pocket will never damage the screen. The downside: the screen is not very tight-fitting at all! it puffs up badly on the bottom. If you text, you have to mash down on the screen hard on the bottom letters and put serious effort into ensuring your space bar actually worked after touching it. Ending a phone cal doesn't work easily either. All in all, its a great case that protects WHILE being thin (unlike OtterBox). However, if you want a sensitive screen, text alot, or get easily frustrated with mashing down on your iphone screen, maybe try something else. I will probably return the case due to this shortcoming . . . but if Lifeproof fixes the screen I will certainly re-purchase it.
I found no issues with this case. Mine came with an a adapter (waterproofed) for headphones. its light, makes handling my iPhone much easier as its not so slippery. I found that i can place and end a call with no problems what so ever. you do have to apply a little more pressure along the edges but not that much. Overall I find it to be more than i expected...... way more. if I were to add a minus it would be the price but considering the cost of what its protecting its not so bad after all. Im very happy with this case.
After three days of having this case on my iPhone I feel that it is awesome. All of the negative reviews on this site made me second guess my decision but I felt like I had to try it for myself. I originally had a Zagg shield on the case when I put it on and I DID have a smudge on the case when the protector was on from hitting the cases screen protector but once removed it is no more. There isn't need for a screen protector while being in this case anyways. Yes, the music is dampened a bit but what do you expect from a completely water, dust, and everything else proof case? You have to expect somethings to give for the durability you are gaining with this case. Definitely happy with this product, recommend it to anyone who works or lives in harsh conditions!
I wanted to keep this case badly, I have small kids and I love to be able to hand them my phone and know that if they get it sticky or dirty I can just run it under water and have it cleaned up and good to go. Also, it is smaller than the Otterbox. I love that this case seals the phone in, with Otterbox dust gets in through port holes and scratches the phone. The Lifeproof case protection was not worth the sacrifices in function. The light/proximity sensor did not work with the case on, it rattled and buzzed like crazy when the phone speaker was on and the screen protector is poorly designed. I am willing to deal with muffled sound, understanding that some compromises will be made to have the protection that this case offers, however, I was not able to deal with the screen cover, buzzing, and loss of proximity sensor funtion. Great Idea....Needs some refinement though,especially for $80.00 I had to return this case and get the Otterbox.
I bought this the first day it was available! I need a waterproof case and that is why I went lifeproof! This is a awesome feature that I can't pass up and one that Otter Box does not offer as of yet! The fact that I can take this thing under water and I can keep my phone with me where I normally would not is A+ in my book and out weighs any issues that you read about elsewhere in the reviews! If you do not need a water proof case then stick with the bulky heavy Otter Box or whatever case you normally use! I'm telling ya this is priceless for what you can do with it! As far as calling Lifeproof, I did and they are sending me another case (just like that) to try and see if it changes anything! I had no problems and the phone call took less than 5 minutes, however I was on hold for about 15 minutes prior to talking to someone, but it was an easy call w/pleasant service! My best advice is consider what you need the case for and make a decision based on your needs! I love the case and would recommend it to anyone with the need for a waterproof case!
This case is horrible. The sound is muffled, and makes a high pitch squeal while on speaker. The screen feels cheap and has a watermark. I've tried 3 cases this week, two black, one white, all of which have had the same issues. The Otterbox Defender on the other hand is the best case they've ever put out. They actually improved their case for the iPhone 5. I will be returning mine LP cases tomorrow.
If Otter box made a water-proof, they would be doing so much more business. Their cases are solid and attractive as well. I bought this simply because of the water-proof feature; however, you give up alot of great qualities in order to get that. It is water-proof, but not very good functionality. The screen protector is simply cheap, clear plastic like the windows in children's toy packaging.
The sound quality of the Iphone 5 case is horrible vs the Iphone 4 case in speaker mode. I don't mind that the sound is a bit muffled but it sounds like the speaker is blown. If you put your finger on the clear window in the back of the case the quality improves but nobody wants to always have to do that to listen to the speaker phone. Other than that, the rest of the quality of the case is great. I'm just very dissapointed with the HORRIBLE sound quality of the case while in speaker mode. I used to be a Lifeproof product advocate...but not with the iphone 5 case.IMO they released it too early to make it available for christmas...
It really does depend upon your needs. I'm an arborist, so I bring my phone with me on climbs, in case a 911 call need be made. If I drop it out of a tree, no case is going to protect the phone sufficiently. I've been using an Otterbox Defender case while I waited for this case to be released. The Otterbox is larger, (though not by any great dimensions), but it is much beefier, and I suspect that, in a side by side test, it would give much greater impact protection. However, my work pants' pockets are full of sawdust and grit. That said, the Otterbox case has openings around the mic, speakers and camera lens; in the month or so I've been using it, debris tends to get into the case, causing minor scratches to the face of my phone, (I did experience the minor play in the otterbox case, top-to-bottom, which allowed the phone to shift up and down slightly). I really don't think I require a waterproof case, (probably few of us do), but the full seal is important for my needs. The lifeproof case does not seem to be constructed with the same quality of materials as the otterbox. I did get a case that has foam on the back, near the top, but I still experienced the vibration from the backplate, which causes an audible buzzing and distortion, when using speakerphone, playing music and during ringtone. I solved this by placing a thin piece of cotton on the back of the phone about 2/3 of the way down and closing the case back up. I suspect that lifeproof will solve the vibration issue by putting another piece of foam lower on the back, perhaps a vertical strip. There is much more airspace between the screen protector and screen than there was with the otterbox, which I've realized requires a firmer push, much less screen responsiveness with the lifeproof, especially near the top of the screen where they have applied foam to keep the protector away from the speaker and sensors. If I did not require a fully sealed case for my working situation i would have stayed with the otterbox and saved the extra money. Hope this this helps.
Nothing like this case out there on the market. Does "EXACTLY" what it's supposed to. Works perfect and I'm a little particular about my cases. Never had one quite like this. Highly recommend it. Very slender compared to OtterBox Defender. Great quality. Sounds quality is adequate. You can't expect a phone that is totally encased in a water tight sealed case to sound perfect. Someone else mentioned that if you listen to music you can open the charging door and it works fine? Absolutely correct. Sounds just fine. Awesome case. I've only had OtterBox Defenders in the past. I'm sold on LifeProof now! Go LifeProof!
I received my case yesterday and have had no issues and like it much better than my 4S LifeProof case!!!!
Lifeproof is selling a defective iphone 5 product with no intentions on maling good for their loyal customers with the only response being its best buys issue
Whether or not you love this case or hate it is all going to depend on how you're expecting to use it. If you're expecting it to be a full-time, everyday case you're probably going to be severely disappointed. If you're expecting it to be a case that you only put on to allow you to use your phone in situations where it previously would have been impossible, you're probably going to love it. There are enough quirks with the case (pretty bad sound quality and diminished touchscreen responsiveness are the biggest two) that using it as an everyday case would significantly detract from your iPhone user experience. However, using your iPhone while floating in a pool, sitting on the beach, out on a boat, or skiing down a mountain is still a pretty cool experience even if the sound and responsiveness are a bit diminished. After all, using a slightly less responsive iPhone is still a better option than the previous choice in these situations, which was leaving your phone at the house. So if you find yourself in these types of environments often enough that you can justify spending $80 on a case that you only use for specialized situations then you won't be disappointed. Just don't plan on using it everyday.
This case does what it is advertised to do. It is waterproof. It is rugged. It keeps your phone safe. The case looks very sleek and well designed. I had the otterbox defender series case before this and returned it because it was AWFUL. The screen protector had a rainbow effect, the case was MASSIVE, and it didn't protect the phone from anything other than dropping it. The lifeproof is 100 times better than the otterbox defender case. All of these people claiming that the otterbox is better, probably work for otterbox. The lifeproof case is half as thick as the otterbox, 4 times as durable, and actually protects your phone from the most harmful things. The screen protector can be awkward because it does not sit flush to the screen. Although it is a bit loose, the functionality of the screen is not really hindered. Sometimes I cant hit the end call button, but I simply hit the lock button instead. The sound is a bit muffled, but what did you expect from an air-tight case????????? Just open the bottom door if you need to listen to music with the phone speakers. The case slides easily in and out of my pocket unlike the otterbox. Overall, this case is the ONLY option for people with an active lifestyle. It keeps your phone completely safe all of the time.
So I got this despite the bad reviews and that was stupid. The first night I used it it was OK. I did not get any of the sound issues that have been mentioned in some of the reviews. I hear there are 2 versions of this case floating around. I think i have the newer one with the foam around the speaker.... And that is what is causing the problem. You cant hit end on a phone call. When you press the bottom of the screen, it pillows up at the top and sets off the proximity sensor which locks the screen. To end a phone call, you have to either 1. Open the charging port. or 2. use 2 hands to stabilize the screen. It is a very poorly designed product. Can't really use it everyday. Support is ZERO. I have called 20 times and the line is busy. Sent 3 emails and never heard back. Guess I have to return it. I hear that Otter-box is coming out with a similar case soon called the Armor Series.
DO NOT BUY! Too many issues with this case and way too expensive to have so many things wrong with it. Go get the Otterbox Defender!
I had this case for the 4S and my case for the 5 actually works better than the 4S case did. I will never have another phone without one of these cases. I am a buisness professional, a photographer and I live an extreamly active lifestyle. I no longer have to worry about water damage for my phones. I have several friends who are parents of small children who swear by these covers. I love it only wish they would have made the new 5 cases in colors.
Just picked up case I have no issues case is fine it fits fine looks excellent very light I recommended the case without a doubt #teamlifeproof they did it again GREAT JOB
I really wanted to like this case! It is slim for the amount of protection it provides. Even after getting it and noticing that there was so much space in between the screen protector, I thought I might be able to just live with it or that it would maybe get better...it didn't. Because of this space (I'm assuming), there are a few functional problems, not just aesthetics. -occasional earpiece feedback -when calling, the red "end" button does nothing. I'm guessing that one of the sensors is covered/not covered/whatever and the phone is confused. -along the same lines, while using the Waze app (gps), I cannot quit the app the proper way since, again, a sensor is covered. -typing is a pain. I'm a lot slower and tend to go back and correct a lot more because of the space. -the back of the case vibrates very loudly when the phone rings, while playing music, on speaker phone, etc. It's not just a little either. All in all, I'm extremely disappointed with the case and also with Lifeproof as a company. I sent an email to their support address and am still waiting for a response.
Not sure why so many negative reviews, I was apprehensive. Needed a case for work so I decided to try it. Very similar in performance to the iPhone 4/4s case... Screen isn't as responsive as without a case but as expected. If you've used an iPhone 4/4s in a lifeproof case it is very comparable.
I got this case because I had it for my iPhone 4. I went to put it on and used it for a day and kept getting a ringing sound in the earpiece this would not go away it sounds like feed back. I was also experiencing that I couldnt touch the end button on the phone and end a call because the air pocket was too great. I exchanged out the case thinking that it was defective but it wasnt. I will be returning this case when I have time to. Great idea but it still needs more R&D.
Ive read some of the reviews and I have to be honest here. Im not looking to listen to music unless I use plugs on a plane during travel, so speakers sounding a little distorted is no big deal. The touch screen is sensative enough to use with no problem. This is a high speed low drag case that is made for those of us that cant take the time to dust it off and hang it on a belt. It goes from bugout bag to pocket to the ground and in the water and keeps on smiling.
At first I was very excited to pick up this case, seemed like the perfect fit for me, as i work construction and deal with a lot of abuse and dust daily. The case does that part as advertised and is waterproof and dustproof, it also seems pretty tough. However the case has many design issues that make it hard to deal with on a daily basis. For some reason it frequently causes really loud feedback during phone calls, its annoying and usually wont stop until you end the call. The built in screen protector is also hard to deal with daily, it sits off the screen so you have to push hard, especially near the top of the phone where a seal around the earpiece raises it even further. With the new iphones longer screen this is a pretty annoying issue making you have to push down hard several times. The speaker phone also becomes useless from my experience, you will be able to hear your caller but they wont be able to hear you through the waterproof seal. Last but not least you cant listen to anything on the phone though the speaker phone, music, videos etc without a huge amount of rattle, like your speakers are blown. Its incredibly annoying and you have to push on the back of the case to prevent it. At the end of the day unless you want this case just as a waterproof gimmick, stay away until they work some of these issues out
Bought white and black for my phone and wife's. Feels solid as a rock. I've had no issues when using phone. Music sounds horrible but if you open charge port, sounds perfect. I wanted my phone to look cool and be protected - this does that.
I'd heard great things about lifeproof cases from friends with one for the iPhone 4/4S and decided to take the plunge with my iPhone 5. The company took a while to get the case to market, but promised it was because they were designing the case to fit the new phone. I waited because it is much smaller than the Otterbox (which is so big I think it detracts from the iPhone) and waterproof (a great feature living in Florida and being around water a lot). Well, I got the case and it proved to be waterproof (I even took it in the shower because I could after I got it) but that was the end of my loving the case. I found the speakers didn't sound very good unless you opened the charger door (which ruins the waterproof part). In fact, they sounded like a blown out speaker and dampened volume. That was a problem, but not what's causing me to return the case. Today I discovered I can't end a phone call with the case on my phone! It's responsive to use the dock on the phone (so I can open up the phone app and whatnot) but when it comes time to hang up, the case won't let me. Seeing as I have an iPhone in part to make phone calls, a case that won't let me end them has committed a cardinal sin for a phone case. Hopefully Lifeproof will get it together in the future, but at $80, I expect to be able to at least make and end calls. Don't get the case unless you're never going to need to end a call on your phone.
This case is worthless. It has a severe pillow effect that that raises the screen protector upwards, and prevents you from ending calls. The proximity sensor is rendered useless due to it getting blocked by the case. I tried three cases, and each had the same problem. Not worth the $86 price.
After waiting month and half, becouse they wanted to get it right, looks like a failure. have same oil/water mark around the middle of screen as some others do and sound gets muffled when you go about half volume. doesnt matter if your talking to someone or listening to music. I have had complaints from other people when i had phone on speakerphone that they got bad feed back. I also noticed that the protective screen doesnt sit right on the screen, so u may have to hit or swipe again.Its a great looking case, needs improvement
Hoping this case would be as good as the 2nd gen 4S case. NOT! I went thru 6 cases before getting one I can live with. Horrible sound, horrible pillowing! Try again lifeproof
Today (11-09-12) I purchased the LifeProof case for my brand new iPhone 5 based upon the brand recommendation from a friend. I activated the phone and put it in the LifeProof case, which resulted in multiple issues. The front screen on the case is clearly not made to fit the phone. It bubbles and could be characterized as wavy in certain spots. In addition, the touch sensor was totally off to the point where I was unable to touch "end" to stop a phone call. Humorous enough until you go into a voicemail and can't stop the message until you open the case and take the phone out in order to stop the call. Thinking it could possibly be a new phone issue, I took the phone out of the case and it worked perfectly. I replicated the issue multiple times, which indicates there is major issue here. Last, but not least, there sound quality is subpar and callers get interference if you even rub a finger anywhere near the bottom side of the phone. In the end, I am seriously disappointed with this $80 phone case after all the anticipation I had purchasing it. Do not buy! I will be returning it tomorrow and probably going back to the OtterBox!
I've had the 4/4s Lifeproof case and it was okay, but a let down for the cost. It is insulting that Lifeproof calls this the free because it is way pricey and not worth the money. The one I bought today for my Iphone5 failed its leak test... so it is returning tomorrow. I went ahead and stuck my phone in there to check sound quality--- awful speaker quality.... low and very muffled. Not only is the price point this unacceptable, leaking out of the box sucks as much as the sound quality.
I loved my 4S LifeProof case so I purchased the life proof case for my 5. LifeProof definatley dropped the ball. The sound is horrible and the screen protector is worse then my 4S case. Life Proof claims they made changes for the better. Not true, they made changes for the worse! Wait for someone else to make a waterproof case.
Great case with some flaws. Music sounds muffled and vibrates in case. screen is a little flimsy. Haven't tried the waterproof test yet so can't comment on that. Other than that seems to be a good case just wish the sound quality was better.
The case design is initially quite good but after much use the annoyance of the screen cover and the inconsistent reaction to touch is very annoying. The middle of the screen works just fine but the top and the bottoms of the screen are difficult to use. Texting is frustrating, trying to hit the space key is hit & miss as is all other keys at the bottom of the screen...which is all of them. Most headphones will not plug in through the headphone port so you must use an extension that screws in to the case and is cumbersome. If you only use the Apple provided headphones, which are still terrible in both comfort and sound quality, the headphones port will work just fine without the extension/adapter. The headphone adapter degrades the call quality with headphones and seems to have more static than plugging directly into the phone itself. If you use speaker phone often this case is not good at all. Phone volume must be very high to hear adequately, the case then distorts the sound quite badly when turned up high enough to hear.
I wanted so much to like this case. The Pro's: its a slim design, I owned an Otter box for my iPhone 4 it was a great case it was just too bulky for my my tastes. When the life proof case came out for the iPhone 4 I wanted to switch, but the price was just too high knowing I was going to be upgrading, so I waited. For the most part this case seems very well designed. It's slim the door for the charge port has a metal hinge rather than a rubber 1 like the Otter Box. after 2 years the rubber one came off after heavy ware. I don't think the Life Proof will do that. The Con's: For the price it should come with a belt clip. The built in screen protector bubbles up around the corners so getting the screen to react to my presses is an annoyance. I thought it was just mine, but I bought 2 cases 1 for me and 1 for my wife they both do it. The sound enhancement feature that the case provides is another annoying thing, if you turn the volume too high it distorts the sound. If you turn it down it does not amplify it enough to hear properly. I made a speaker phone call to my wifes work and she could not hear me I had to hold the phone almost to my face like a regular call for her to hear. What's the point of speaker phone then. Also when I used it as a regular phone I would get massive feed back when I spoke on it. I took the phone out of the case and made several calls no issues. My wifes case does have the distortion, but she doesn't seem to have the feed back issue. So maybe its just the case I got who knows. A minor annoyance too is the switch on the side for the silent feature is reversed so when you want to make it silent you have to push up on the switch rather then down. Again this is minor if this were the only issue it would not be a deal breaker. I will be exchanging this case mainly because I use my phone a lot for work and frankly the hit or miss with the screen touch, is just going to make me mad so not sure if I'll give it another go and exchange or just switch to the Otter Box.
I held off on getting this case for my iPhone 4S and regretted not doing it after all the great video and pictures I saw from friends that used the case underwater or at the beach with their kids. This case is great for active parents with kids who have sticky fingers and butterfingers that tend to drop things. However, the sound quality is horrible. The speaker is muted so the sound vibrates throughout the case. I don't expect perfection, just decent sound so that I can listen to music at my desk or watch a movie. I don't know if its possible to accomplish this, but it's definitely a drawback to not have good sound through the membrane on the bottom of the case. The ports on the bottom are deeply set in. My 30 pin adapter will not work for the lightening connection. Another huge drawback since I still dock my phone to my clock radio with the adapter overnight. For almost $90 after tax, it's a huge chunk of change. Almost not worth it at full retail. I've only had the case for a few hours and it does not seem to be growing on me. The size is great. It adds very little to the bulk of the phone, almost like carrying the 4s. It's very light and for the most part, sleek. I may take this back tomorrow and save the money for a waterproof camera.
The home button is raised off the phone a little, but otherwise, it's a snug, secure fit and feels like it will really keep my phone protected
Fit snugly and protects my phone from damage. Color fits my style. Doesn't add too much thickness.
Really like this case. Fits the phone like a glove & is not slippery. Not dropped it once yet. Doesn't leave fingerprints & love the color.
The case is nice and made very well and I like how it just slides on...BUT it is nowhere near true to color!! It says magenta, but it is a burnt orange color. Do not get it if you're looking for a pink magenta colored case. I will probably return it and get something else...I don't like the color.
The case is light and not bulky, I like it but the problem is that I only have had it for about a month and it's already peeling on the edges next to the glass.
Such a tight fit I could not remove. Took it back and customer service said they did not want to try to remove because it might damage the phone! Totally unbelievable! Would not stand behind the product they sold me. Will say customer service personnel did make numerous phone calls including local apple store, but to no avail! Thank goodness for techie Andrew who offered to try.... Success after several attempts! Do not buy if you want to change cases or maybe a battery!
I love the case durability and belt clip, it works flawlessly. Whatever material they used, does not stay white long. It's not like I dropped this in a mud puddle, it's just normal use and didn't even make a month before all the edges look dingy and yellow. If you need a belt clip/case then go for another color. Pity since my iPhone was white, but now i'm buying something else because it looks dirty all the time.
Great to finally get a lightweight case and hip (belt) clip combo for a reasonable price.
I grabbed this case on the first day the phone came out. I was not expecting much but after using the case it has turned out to be a great case. The case has the tightest fit that I have ever had with any case, and it adds basically no bulk to the phone. If you are wanting a case that is drop proof this is not your case, but if you are not wanting to add weight and size to the phone but provide some form of protection from scratching this is the perfect case.
I love my case!!!!!! Will recommend to all my friends
Have always preferred iSkin cases for my iPhone but with no Revo for the 5 I needed a new case. Looks great on the phone, very minimal and thin. Still has a good grip. I wonder if it will provide the same protection from drops being so thin. Was worried that the holster would be fragile, but it's been very solid.
i like this case its just the right size and not big and bulky.
after getting my iPhone 5, had to get a case. I was looking around at the case section.. I find this case in particular appealing. Took a while to unpackage it as It comes in a tricky to open plastic carton. I like the inner suede like feel inside the case parts and holster, and the case locks on pretty firm. Like the above review, it was definitely hard to remove. The trick is, on the bottom short half of the case, there are these 3 notches or guides. I lay the phone on my bed face down, and hold onto the bottom half pressing my thumb at the top where those guides are and then the case releases. I dropped the phone with the case once; phone is fine, but it appears some of the smooth covering on the case itself may have rubbed off, showing a bit of shine. Overall, its good for a start
Perfect for for the phone. Barely adds any bulk. Solid belt clip so you don't have to keep the phone in your pocket.
I like that it gives me the option of carrying the phone in my pocket or attaching it to the enclosed clip with the same protection. It has a velvet lining to protect the screen as it faces inward into the clip. I purchased a bundle set that included the Zagg invisibe Shield to provide an additional level of military grade protection.
This well built belt clip case appears to be more solidly built than some of the belt clip cases I've seen. You can place the iPhone 5 in the swivel holder with the screen pointed inward to protect the screen. The case around the iPhone unclamps easily in and out of the belt clip holder. The case swivels on the clip holder. I prefer to carry my phone horizontally so the tight fitting swivel works out perfectly. The only thing I would change is make the clip a wee bit longer for a little bit more security..
I bought this for my iPhone 5, because I wanted a case with holster that wasn't too bulky. It's a nice looking case and holster, but I tried taking my phone out to show my sister and the case is almost impossible to remove. I am considering breaking it off my phone, but I don't want to damage my iPhone 5. Lets see how long it takes me to take it off!
THE CASE IS OKAY BUT THE KICK STAND DOES NOT WORK FOR THE CAMERA IN THE VERTICAL POSITION
Buy it, you'll love it! The case comes Steep price but it's worth it
It's a great deal. You get a sleek case, it has a nice kick-stand, a nice holster- all for a great price. BUT... the kick-stand broke on day 4. The door uses a magnet glued to the kick-stand to stay closed. On day 4, the glue gave up. The magnet came off the kick-stand leaving it propped open at all times. (Picture below.) I took it back for the the non kick-stand version. If they fix this defect, it will be a great product, but until then, it's worthless. Also, not a real concern but worth noting: this kick-stand only works in the landscape position, not portrait like other stands.
I am a heavy cell phone user: I don't own a home phone, I bank online (via my cell), I check and respond to email (via my cell) and make calls and text often. I needed a case that protected my new iPhone 5 from scratches and wear and tear, and didn't take away from the slim look and feel of the phone. I actually went all around town buying cases (7 cases to be exact) to make sure I found what I wanted. I took them all home to avoid the pressure of sales reps and rushing to buy only to regret it later. This case stood out well above all the others, HANDS DOWN! Very secure holster that can be used with the case or without. It holds the phone securely and it will not fall out no matter what you're doing. Nice soft, yet firm feeling case. Sleek black that compliments the phone. The kickstand is perfect for viewing hands free while watching movies or listening to music. Needless to say, I took the other 6 cases back. This is the case to get! It's costly at $40, but once you use it for a day, you'll realize your money was well invested. I'm hooked on this holster and case and see why it is highly recommend by all that use it. Don't sleep on this case. If you do, all other cases will not satisfy your every need to transport your new iPhone 5. Check it out for yourself, you wont be disappointed!!
I love the new case.Fits much more snug.Its very thin,sleek and protective.The kickstand is very handy watching Netflix with wireless headphones!
I hate the look of "Mr. Business Man with a phone holster", BUT....it's slim enough that it doesn't actually feel like you're holding a case, and it's still durable and solid enough to protect your phone and stay seated in the holster, regardless of the activity. The small kickstand is also a nice feature, although it DOES NOT allow you to stand the phone up in a portrait position (landscape only). I had this for the iPhone4 and without hesitation got it for the 5. Easy to take on a off if you'd like (for putting in an armband for running, etc.). Love it!
Overall this case it very nice save for the high price. The useful kick stand has a design flaw however in that it should have opened up in the other direction. As it opens now, the volume control faces down on the table, I feel it would have made more sense for the control to face up instead for quick volume control access.
I've only had this for a day but since there are no reviews I thought I'd throw in my two cents after getting it out of the package and having some hands on time with it. First, this is a two part thin hard shell slider case with a built-in kickstand and a separate belt clip holster. All parts are felt-lined so it does have a small level of protection against dirt/grime scratching up the phone while it's in the case. All ports have cutouts and no ports are blocked. The case extends slightly over and completely around the front bezel with a raised edge for screen protection. The slider locks both ends firmly in place and requires quite a bit of pressure to unlock (press hard right in the middle while pulling it apart). I highly doubt this thing would come apart if dropped. Even with it's minimal extension over the front bezel, the edges still caught on my screen protector so either get a case-optimized screen protector or be very very careful when sliding it on. It's a very tight, secure fit. Back to it being thin - it feels thick enough to protect the phone in case of an accidental drop but also thin enough to keep the phone slim. I wouldn't feel safe doing a test drop, but I also wouldn't trust my phone in a case that were any thinner. For me, it's an ideal compromise. The shell material itself is like a very hard TPU. It's not super grippy like silicon, but it's not glossy slick like plastic or most other hard shell cases either. Overall, I like the texture and think it's a perfect blend. I like how easily it slides out of my pockets when I'm sitting down, but also has enough grip to stay seated on angled surfaces. There is a small protrusion on the back for the magnetic kick stand. The kick stand itself is kept extended by a spring. When you're done with it, you just push it back in to the case and a magnet locks it in place. I believe the entire kickstand assembly is made of metal, but it's hard to tell. Either way, I'm very pleased with it. The kickstand is silver in color regardless of what case color you choose. The included plastic holster will hold the phone face in or face out with a simple spring-loaded lock clip to hold the phone in place, the holster itself is black no matter which case color you choose. The inside of the holster is also felt lined in case you choose to store the phone face-in. The clip that holds the phone provides good locking pressure, just enough to not be a pain but also to keep the phone secure. The belt clip on the back rotates and has detents to lock it into whatever angle you want. The belt clip itself does not lock open like the Otterbox cases, but that's OK. I noticed that even without locking it too can also serve as a kickstand when the holster is horizontal and offers a comfortable viewing angle if you don't want to use the kickstand on the case. All of the pieces seem well-constructed. It's no Otterbox, but if thin, light and versatile is your thing than you'll probably be happy with this case as I am. For what you get compared to the Otterbox I see this as being priced a little too high. However, the Otterbox is big and bulky and there are currently no other thin, light and well protected alternatives to all the advantages of this case so the premium was worth it to me.
Overall great product...thin yet durable................
This case discolored quickly less than a week. It is also hard to take on and off. If all you need it for is the kickstand it works great for that. If you care about appearances which if you own an iPhone 5 I assume you do don't buy this product.
Great case. Very thin and has a kickstand. Protect the phone and also has a small lip in the front , so face down doesn't scratch the screen .
i have been useing these cases for years & one thing i know is that for each phone , these are a must you also have a kickstand for viewing on the 4" screen hands free, also good for facetime. protect the phone and also has a small lip in the front , so face down does not scratch the front at all
Great case. Very thin and has a kickstand, Quality case. Great price.
Aesthetics: I have the teal case on my white iPhone and the color combination looks very classy, yet fun. I like that they contrasted the somewhat bright teal color with the gray edging, to achieve this look. I also like that the case is translucent, allowing the Apple logo to be visible. I'm also glad the "Belkin man" logo is NOT on the case. The text "Belkin" is molded into the side opposite the volume buttons in a simple, low-profile classy font. The case is thin enough to not add much bulk, and allows the phone to easily slip into jeans' pockets, yet thick enough to provide good protection for the phone. Function: Volume and power buttons are functional and have a good feel. Case provides good impact protection. I dropped this phone about 4 times in 4 weeks, and the phone was in perfect condition afterwards. All ports function with OEM plugs (Lightning, headphones). I don't have the "no-wire' Lightning-to-30 pin adapter yet, so I don't know if that will work. I've seen other reviewers say that it does NOT, but I think the adapter with the wire between the 2 plugs should work fine, since it's just like the Lightning plug that comes with the phone. The only potential negative part of this case relates to the deeply recessed silent switch. The silent switch might be difficult to work if the user doesn't have fingernails of some length. Overall, I am VERY happy with this case and recommend it for those who want a low profile, classy case to provide basic impact protection and provide more grip to avoid drops.
If you're looking for a stylish and protective case that doesn't add much bulk then this is it. I bought over 25 cases for my iPhone 4 and I'm somewhat of a case addict. I know my cases. This was the first case I bought for my iPhone 5 after my positive experience with it on my iPhone 4. Overall, it's a great case and I don't see any reason you'd be disappointed in it.
I've been trying out a few cases for my new 5, and this was the first one I picked up. I liked the two-tone style and the see-through back. When I put it on my phone it looked great! But... after getting it home and using it awhile, I noticed the sides of the case are really thick. So thick, I have to use my fingernail to reach the mute switch. I got the same case for my old 4, and I have to use a dock adapter to connect it. Also the 5 felt wider in my hand, so it had a bulky feel. I was very sad to return this case, but it just wasn't slim enough.
It took me a week to choose a case for my new iPhone 5. After much "window shopping" I finally chose this one. I am very pleased with it. This is the first case I've had that is easy to use. It fits the phone well and I think it will protect the phone very well. I love the color - it looks great on the phone!
So far I absolutely love it, best iPhone case ever. It fits the phone really nicely and feels real nice in the hand. The colors also look awesome. In typical iPhone case fashion it was $30, but I think it was well worth it. The quality is great compared to the other cheaper cases I got on Amazon. Because they had it in store the day after the iPhone was released I was a little scared it would not fit properly but that is not the case. (Apple doesn't give specs of their phones to anyone before release) Here are some pictures of my phone with the case: http://imgur.com/a/kG6aM
Fun colors to choose from; really like the raised, exterior buttons that make it easier to access the on/off and volume buttons. Other cases often have "cut outs" for the existing buttons which can make finding and using the buttons a bit more cumbersome.
Really like this case for black IPHONE 5 . Feels good in my hand, front edge bevels back in towards screen, so protects glass when facing down. Like the purple/teal combination, but would love to see some more options such as purple/red, but this was the best option for something colorful that looked good on black when the phone first came out. I like a colorful case to make it easier to find phone in purse, around the house, etc. Price maybe a bit high, but good value and will use this for several years.
I got the case in a package deal, when the 5 was first released. There wasn't many other options (or other options quickly sold out) so I went with this case. It's great, just what I wanted - something to protect my phone from light scratches but won't add weight or bulk to my phone.
This is a great case, The colors a beautiful, its slim, it's just perfect
Cute colors, sturdy, grippy, overall a good buy to keep the new iPhone 5 clean
This case fits the iPhone 5 much better compared to the Rocketfish Soft Shell Case - Clear and Griffin Reveal Case. The smooth satin finish and rounded front lip make it comfortable to hold. My phone did slip off my lap today due to the finish though, so be cautious. Note that there is no 'dot-man' logo on the back of the case, as pictured above. Belkin is still spelled out on the edge of the case. Also note that the front lip, power and volume buttons are the same semi-transparent blue as the back, so you get some more color accents than what's shown in the picture.
This case is great! Doesn't change the shape or weight of the phone. Available in great color combos although this one is my fav!
This is the best iPhone case I have ever bought. Impressive appearance and color. 100%fit the iPhone 5.
This case is a great alternative to bigger bulkier cases. It's the same as a bumper case but has a backing to protect the back of the phone
The case is great and fits wonderfully, but the yellow green band around the outside of the case discolors after use. I keep my phone inside a microfiber case to protect it from the dyes in my blue jeans. I exchanged it twice thinking it was a defect in that case but ended up returning for a refund because it continued to discolor only after a few days.
Tried out a few different cases, this by far is my favorite. Lightweight and very protective. I wouldn't hesitate to get it.
This is a great case. IMO it doesn't add too much thickness to the iPhone 5 like other cases. It easily slides into and out of your pocket. As far as protection not sure how it will handle a drop and I don't plan on testing that out. Overall this is a great looking case. The only thing wrong and it is not the case's fault is that if you have a screen protector that extends all the way to the edge of your phone the case may peel it off. I solved this problem by buying a case optimized skin online and it is perfect.
I have tried many iPhone 5 cases thus far and this is by far the best. This case fits perfect, has a nice lip around it to protect the screen and looks nice. The feel of the case can be slick at times as it is not grippy at all but for me this is not an issue. The only issue I have is that the black iPhone does not really show through the translucent back at all (my wife has the teal/gray case and her black phone is visible through the teal back). I imagine a white iPhone would show well through this case but again this is more a personal preference than a strike against the case. Overall I am very pleased.
This case is thin, has a pleasant tactile finish, and provides scratch protection for the iPhone 5's aluminum back. Don't ruin the incredible minimalist design of the iPhone by engulfing it in an abomination of over-protection like the Otterbox Defender. This is an outstanding case, especially for the price.
Purchased this as a temporary case but it has now become my permanent case. I have purchased dozens of cases starting from the iPhone 3gs through the iPhone 5 and this by far has the best attention to detail and the best fit by an exceeding margin. The phone is very solid in this case and it adds minimal bulk and weight while adding exceptional grip. In my opinion this is a required purchase for any new iPhone 5 and worh every penny of the price. Awesome work Belkin! I almost wish this case had shipped with the iPhone 5 to provide immediate protection straight out of the box. Now there's an idea for Apple to consider... drop a case of this workmanship and quality in that beautiful box to protect our investment. ;)
I purchased this Belkin case to use as a temporary case but it may end up being my permanent one. There is no "dot man logo" as depicted on the website which is what I prefer since it gives it a cleaner look. I got the black/neon green case because I thought the neon would make it easy for me to spot my phone when set on a table. The black is not very sheer so you can't really see the apple logo. I also purchased this case because I wanted something with some grip and this case give its grip without the tack of rubber (which I hear would make it difficult to take out of a pant pocket). The case fits perfectly snug and the bulk is minimal. This case also has a "lip" which allows you to put the phone face down with worrying about the screen scratching on a table. My only gripe is that dust may accumulate on the edge which is not a big deal to clean at all. Another reason I chose this case is that it is made of TPU which has a soft rubbery surface which doesn't scratch like plastic would. I also feel that the TPU material offers more of a cushion than hard plastic would. One thing I hadn't noticed until I compared it with other cases is that ports on this Belkin case are cut out individually rather than having 1 big open hole (more protection?). The volume buttons are also covered and colored to match the back of the case. This attention to detail almost justifies the cost.
I love this case. I purchased it to replace the Griffin Clear Back because it scratched to easy. This case has precise cutouts, great fitment. Color is very nice. I can confirm it isn't as sheer as it appears in the photos and the little green logo is not in the corner either. Couldn't be happier. Hope they make it in more black other color combos.
I really like the look and feel of this case. I like how it overlaps the screen a bit as well as covers the buttons well. The only negative thing is that, while it says in the description that it is sheer, it really isn't. All-in-all it is still a good case.
I love the texture and it feels like it would really do a decent job protecting in a fall . It fits snug, and adds a slight lip over the screen so you can put the phone face down without the screen touching any surface.
The fit is great. The bottom has separate ports for the speakers and lightning. However, I bought the case thinking it'd be more transparent. It isn't really at all. The logo in the corner isn't there either. Overall I'm happy, but I wish I'd seen it in person before ordering it.
This case fits extremely well; all of the cutouts perfectly match the iPhone 5. I really like the texture, too. It's not glossy, but it's not rubbery, either. It adds very minimal bulk but does have a slight lip that provides some protection if you lay the phone face-down.
Just like it, it feels good in my hands and fits my phone perfectly.
When I look for a case for my iPhone, I like the ones that are flexible, but not overly rubbery feeling. I want cases that don't slip from my hand when using my phone. Another good feature is the fact that it protects the side buttons from dirt and the case is easy to put on and off my phone so that I can clean it if needed. My only complaint is that when I purchased my phone I was limited to just solid color cases. I would like more designs to choose from in this type of case.
I like this case a lot. The fit is snug and it feels like a nice hard plastic. There is a slight overhang around the screen for protection. Because it is plastic, it slips easily in and out of your pants pockets. But there is also a raised logo right where your middle finger rests when you hold it in your right hand, which gives you grip where you need it. Very clever. I appreciate that it comes in clear, because you can still see the beautifully resolved industrial design of the iPhone 5. If anything, it makes the iPhone look visually a little more sleek, while adding almost no physical bulk. My only complaint is that the opening around the volume and mute buttons is a little tight, but they are still functional.
As a regular texter, I really appreciate the light-touch typing and autocorrect that combine to allow for fast texting.
The iphone5 is an amazing phone! This phone is amazingly fast and the LTE is a great feature to have. If you have used an iPhone before then there is no learning curve, the OS hasn't changed that much but the new features that the update brought work very well. The phone itself is extremely thin and light. When I first picked it up I could not believe how light this thing was, and the larger screen was much needed. Overall if you are an iPhone user and you have a iPhone 4 or an earlier version than this phone is a must buy, but it you have a 4S then wait for the next one it has all the same features minus the 4 inch display.
I really like the phone, we just have issues with our service. The service cuts in and out, not the fault of the phone. This phone does cool stuff and if doesn't, search for an app that will make it cool. Very fast compared to my old phone. Love it!!!!
Way better than my old droid phone! I never have to reboot or anything it just works like always I love the iPhone this phone is awesome
Love this phone, And so fast and the battery last real long.
I had the iPhone 4S with AT&T. Loved the phone but hated the service! I chose to go with Verizon iPhone 5. All I can say is I'm amazed! I would have to say the phone is Fast and Flawless! If you like a phone with seemless works then you need a iPhone 5 I use to have a Android as well! If you like to personalize your phone stay with android! But if you want a flawless design without any hiccups then choose the iPhone 5. The size and look of the phone are perfect! I have the white and love it! Camera is the best just like a high end digital camera! The process speed and Siri is amazing on Verizon LTE and in my area I have never lost the LTE service! Battery life is amazing! I can go about 2 days on a charge and that's with use and texting! All I can say is Apple you have come out on top again!
This is bar none probably the best phone on the market. The phone is just so smooth and works without a hiccup. The phone just works. I was coming from an android phone and the battery life blows my old phone away. I was actually afraid to use my old phone due to the poor battery life. Now, I can use my phone and not worry about my battery draining. This phone is awesome with Verizon's blazing fast 4G LTE. The overall package that Apple gives you is amazing. Amazing display, amazing speed, amazing design, amazing phone. Well worth the money, you will not be disappointed.
Love the phone features especially SIRI. I also love the 4G
My first IPhone, would never buy anything else! Awesome!!! Very happy!!!
So to level set- I am on the first generation iPhone schedule so I bought the 3,4 and now the 5 (skipped the S generations with the 2yr contract interval). I waited 2 years to upgrade from my AT&T iPhone4 and it was a LONG 2 years mainly because I wasn't impressed with the signal quality. Moving to Verizon I was amazed that I could take a phone call in my basement! I used to have to stand on my front porch when my phone rang or the call would drop. The only downside is using data while talking on the phone but honestly, I have only had 2 occasions where I wished I could have done that and it was no big deal to wait until I hung the phone up to search for something. When I first used the iPhone5 the biggest difference I noticed was the weight. If you hold a iPhone4 and iPhone5 side by side there is a clear difference in weight. The length of the phone is a little longer which I actually liked better for talking purposes. The 4G/LTE is way faster than 3G hands down. The addition of Siri is nice but more of a novelty. The only weird thing I have noticed is that sometimes the sound fades out slightly on some calls but it is intermittant and could just be my phone (or my ears!). All in all - If you are on the fence about getting the 5, I would say shoule feel happy about your purchase. It is a great piece of technology. Moving from the 4s maybe a slight improvement but a must if you want a lighter phone.
I love how smooth and quickly the phone works and the ease of it's use. After having this battery life and no more lagging like my previous droid razr, I would never go back.
I love my iPhone 5. It's the perfect size and very lightweight, yet doesn't feel cheap. Easy to learn to use. Even my technology challenged husband has learned to use it and loves it.
It's nice to finally have LTE service on the Iphone. Phone has a nice large screen and fast processor. So far no issues, great product!
Fast. Sleek. Long lasting battery. Great reception. Fast LTE coverage.
I hate that I have to cover up my beautiful trinket. I would love a mirror/chrome choice. Why offer color choice if the phone is so fragile it needs a total bubble around it leaving no sign of the original design. Better design, better repair cost, refundable insurance at better price. Scared to death of harming my new trinket!
Get it! You won't regret it. It does everything you need it to do as good as you need it to. It's Apple so you know it will work! Buy the american Apple company product to support your dedication to the USA. I have had all 3 major wireless carriers: Buy Verizon if you need dependable service. It costs a little more but is worth it. AT&T is good but has a lot of dropped calls - frustrating. Sprint is the last choice I would get because of poor coverage, speed and customer service.
If you want a phone that works, makes calls, social networking, etc..that you don't have to reset multiple times a week or day, with a clear crisp picture, easy to use, easy to learn, that is always reliable, iPhone 5 is your phone. No it's not the biggest smart phone made, but if you want a big phone buy an iPad. With all the oversized phones out there, apple did the right thing and made their product bigger but yet still comfortable in your hand and pocket. Yes droids can do more customization and are larger, but if you want reliability IPhone 5 is the way to go, super fast over LTE!!!!! ,
Apple has impressed again with the new iPhone 5. The improvements to the design are lovely. The A6 chip is lightening fast, especially when on LTE or a fast wifi network. The new screen is the perfect size. Any taller or wider and the phone would not fit as comfortably in your hand. At first I wasn't a fan of having the added row of apps on the screen, but I got used to that quickly. The new redesigned ear buds are good quality sound and are comfortable in the ear. The phone is very very light, which takes some getting used to. Once a case is added it takes a lot of the bulk away and makes it more comfortable to hold without worrying about dropping it.
I've had Blackberrys for years, but when I bought an iPad earlier this year, and switched to Mac (which my company uses and I purchased one of my own), I was frustrated by the awkwardness of integrating the BB email, etc., with my Apple products. I decided to switch, and to wait for the latest version of iPhone. So far, I am VERY happy with it. It is pleasant to hold in your hand, alone or with a case. I've heard many complaints about "scuffs" and so forth, but my phone was perfect out of the box. Best of all, it plays nicely with my other Apple devices, and my email life (one of my main reasons for having a smartphone to begin with) is now simple. I have to carry an Android (Bionic) for work, and I like the Apple iOS much better. Having already learned to use the iPad, the learning curve was not too steep. I like being able to switch back and forth between the devices at will, without having to mentally switch gears as to what I am using. Apple's tendency to sometimes over-"simplify" things can sometimes be annoying, but overall this is a fantastic phone for my purposes. Glad I was able to get my hands on one so quickly--just dumb luck that a store within driving distance happened to have the one I wanted in stock. I've been with AT&T for years, and like their customer service and coverage. The 32GB size seems "just right."
I upgraded from my iPhone 4 to this one. A huge upgrade. Forget the obvious of the larger screen. Verizon's 4g LTE speeds equal that of my comcast wifi. Battery life (which a lot of 4s owners complain of) is really good. I used my phone for work, and I leave the house with 100% at 7 a.m. and at 10 at night I still have around 40% left. At first the weight is a little odd, it is so light, but after a day or two it is just another added bonus to the phone. OVERALL, if you own the iPhone 4, any earlier model, or any non apple phone stop what you are doing and go get this phone. If you have the 4s, I could see waiting until your upgrade date but that would be very hard for me.
I replaced an aging iPhone 3GS and have been very satisified with the i5. The screen is larger and the resolution is a big improvement. My only regret is the battery life is shorter than I would like. Overall, I would recommend the i5.
Great phone but the droids are more user friendly.
I am new to this whole world, so I experiment with all facets of my phone when I am "killing time". It is amazing for doing most of the things that I normally do on my desktop.
As usual for an Apple product, build quality is excellent with fast, responsive performance. The hotspot feature is a major plus, but takes a while (45-60 sec) to show up as available. Excellent screen. Still not a big fan of the limitations of iTunes for syncing and management. Battery life is not quite as advertised, but considering the size of the phone and the available battery space, it is very respectable. I can usually go a couple of days and still have 25% left.
This is my first iPhone after a few years with a Droid Incredible. I agonized over whether to get the iPhone or the Samsung Galaxy SIII. I'm glad I chose the iPhone love the haven't had any issues. Battery life is great, it's fast, Siri is cool, and I love having iTunes on my phone. The camera is very nice as well. The only issue I had is that for the first week I had this phone without a case and was terrified that I was going to scratch or break it, feels very fragile to me. I wrapped it in an Otterbox Defender case and now it feels bulletproof, although a lot less sleek and streamlined.
Just an overall gray phone. Even though the pinch to zoom can be challenging, it does not outweigh the other gray features or overall quality.
I love my iPhone 5. It is my first smartphone, so I don't have anything to compare it with in that respect, but the internet is speedy (fater on LTE than on wi-fi), the video is great, and it holds a lot of music. The lightning port means that you can't use any of your existing Apple cables, but with a $29 or $39 adapter (depending on if you want just an adapter or if you want about 6" of cable length in addition) the new iPhone can be docked into your old iPhone/iPad/iPod radio or speakers and you can use those old docking cables.
I am very happy I waited for the '5'. It has all the things I need (and then some) for both work and play. The only criticisms I would have is that I thought the camera would be sharper and, if I raise the phone quickly, Siri wants to help me. :-) But I still give it a strong 5 star.
This phone is very easy to learn and use. Lotsa features and apps. Best display I've seen on any phone, photos look outstanding and the camera is awesome. Easily connects with outlook exchange without the need for additional apps. Apple makes great products and this phone delivers the goods.
Very excited for this phone it does everything and more battery life could be better
This is my first smartphone, and I really love all the features, especially icloud, and Siri. I had an iPad, so it was easy to transition to this phone. I am still learning how to use it, but marvel at how much I depend on it already.
This is my second iPhone (1st was 4). Love larger screen and touchscreen. Also first experience to SIRI. While she isn't perfect on answering questions, but great on commands within iOS system. Meaning sending email, text, setting appointments. LOVE IT,,,
Great phone , great display , great camera , nice form factor/design. Battery life is mediocre with moderate use . No generic Lighting Cables available yet so I don't look forward to paying 40 bucks for an extra car charger or office charger .
Really a great phone except for charging problem!!! ; )
This is by far the best mobile phone I have ever had. I came from owning several droid phones, which worked great, but this IPhone 5 beats them hands down for my personal tastes. From the ease of use to the speed of the phone is incredible. It took me a day or two to get used to it being a non droid but I prefer the iPhone interface better. A coworker of mine just bought the Samsung S3 and I must say it is a nice phone but the IPhone 5 has a crisper display. The S voice on the S3 is not nearly as nice as Siri, I played with both. All in all I am very satisfied with my purchase, it was worth the wait.
I had an iPhone 4 changed jobs and went back to a BB! Torture!! I love the phone and the improvements are great! I do not see any improvement in battery life (disappointing). I hope they figure out why service drops and will not come back without reboot!
Love it no problems with the phone itself provider is a different story
Overall, I like my iPhone5. It's easy-smart and very talented for a smart phone. The keyboard is a little sensitive until one gets used to it! I had the iPad3 first, so the transition was simplified! If Apple makes any future changes, I hope they make the screen a little wider...not longer!
So happy I got the phone. I have an iPad (1st one) liked that. I knew my next phone would be this. I had an droid incredible before...this is way better.
Buy one. You can't go wrong. Really. It's the best iPhone yet. On Verizon
Just bought this phone a few days ago. I have jumped back and forth between Apple and Android, and after having many issues with my Galaxy Nexus decided to give the iPhone 5 a try. I'm glad I did. The larger 4" screen makes more of a difference than you would think, and the best part is that Apple did not sacrifice pixel density, so the retina display still looks incredibly vibrant and sharp. Pros -The A6 processor really zips along, with almost no noticeable lag when opening apps or scrolling around. -4G LTE is blazing fast on Verizon's network here in Atlanta, however the phone still says 3G on the top corner sometimes when the speeds are definitely 4G. -The phone is incredibly thin and light, with beautiful beveled edges and a classy looking slate back. I was depressed to have to put an Otterbox Defender on this beauty. Unfortunately my profession calls for nothing less. CONS -The charging port is different from all previous models, being decidedly smaller. Apple plans to sell adaptors to the old connection but they don't seem to be available in large numbers yet. Given that I don't own any iPhone docks or accessories yet, this was not a dealbreaker for me but it undoubtedly will be for some. For those people with lots of money invested in docks and cables, it looks like you have two options- invest in the adaptor for $30 or buy an iPhone 4S instead. For what it's worth the new "Thunderbolt" connection seems to charge the phone incredibly fast. I plugged it in at 15% life and it was up to 35% in under ten minutes. -Battery life is not great but serviceable off of 4G LTE. I use it largely on 3G for e-mail, heavy GroupMe (online instant messaging), Facebook, moderate texts, an hour or so of Pandora, and some phone calls and come home with 60% juice left after a 12 hr shift. I have yet to use it all day on 4G but would **GUESS** I'd be close to dead after the same amount of time. -The back aluminum slate colored surface does seem to scratch a bit easily, so as always a case is strongly recommended. -It could just be me, but as far as the main speakers are concerned, the iPhone 5 seems to have a tinnier, quieter sound than the iPhone 4/4S. It simply sounds a little bit crackly when at its highest volume. Surprisingly, the "Earpods" that come with the new phone sound much better than the old earbuds that came with all previous models, and the Siri integration with the Earpods is a nice useful touch. Lastly, as far as a phone is concerned, it appears to perform as well as the other smartphones out there- no better or no worse. Call quality is great in strong signal areas and iffy in weak signal areas. No dropped calls to speak of yet and it manages to hold on to a 3G/LTE signal fine. -The much maligned Apple Maps app sometimes works great for me and at other times leads me to a location roughly a block or two from where I meant to go. Other than that I have had no problems, and Apple claims to be working on fixing the issues as we speak. Still no Google Maps app to be found on the App store. If you have an iPhone 4 or older, this is definitely worth the extra money over the 4S. If you own the 4S, then you won't find a ton different here. Still, this is clearly the best iPhone yet.
I'm not sure why this phone is getting mediocre reviews, since it is a far cry from mediocrity. It seems like Droid lovers/Apple haters being biased as usual. Let me tell you, first off...I am not biased. I was actually talked out of purchasing an iphone many times by reps at the Verizon store. Hence, I've had countless phones with Droid software because they crashed so often that I was constantly trading them in.. Most recently, the reps convinced me to stick with Droid because the new OS was better and didn't crash as often but I shouldn't have bought into it. Thus far, this phone puts them to shame. For anyone who says Apple never changes it's products; you have to keep in mind that Apple only releases one phone per year. Apple also runs it's operating system on one type of phone; the iPhone. You can't go purchase a Samsung or a Nokia that runs iOs 6. Look at how many Android-based phones come out per month. To me, Apple gets it right the first time. They sell you simplicity and reliability and to me, that has become so important. All of my Droids had so many bugs. They crashed constantly and would restart all the time. The last one was crashing within the first month. In fact, the second week I had it, it froze completely and was not responding to anything so I had to let the battery drain and finally, it restarted. That's when I'd had it and traded it in for the iPhone 5. Thus far, it was a great decision. I was skepticle of Apple at first, but I wish I had gone with my first instinct and purchased the iPhone 4 years ago. My husband has had it since the week it came out and has not had one problem. With the iPhone 5, I am getting better battery life, clearer call reception, it hasn't crashed or frozen once, and personally, I like the more compact design as opposed to giant screen. I can text and take pictures with one hand. The big Droid screens are lovely for watching videos, but that's where it ends. I had burn-in on two of the AMOLED screens in the first week. The Verizon rep also told me that Apple's retina display is not noticeably different and the human eye can't differentiate that it has more pixels. I don't agree. The screen is noticeably more vivid and clear. The battery isn't amazing, but it's far better than any other I've had..oh, and it charges to 100% lightning fast!! I think what truly sets it apart; is the user-friendly software and yes, the camera. No shutter lag, amazing photo quality, and it seems no matter what, my photos look stunning. All in all...I am impressed.
I think personally the 4g is enough of an upgrade for me. I have come from using nothing but iPhones since the 4 came out for Verizon all together awesome phone
If you're using a smartphone for the first time, you'll love this phone. Those who have used Iphones will like it as well. Those of you coming from Android or even Blackberry would likely find this lacking in a lot of very basic and logical features that you now take as a matter of course. Like: o No blinking LED for notifications - those of us who have gotten used to keeping the phone silent and knowing we have messages waiting by the blinking LED - no ability to do this o Notifications ring in ear while on phone - you'll be in the middle of a call, and suddenly a text will come in and your eardrum will burst because the notification goes full on through the earpiece. Not only will the damage hurt, but you'll miss what your caller is saying if they happen to be the one speaking when it comes through. You can flick the switch to "silent" while on a call and avoid this, but who wants to have to do that every time a call comes in? o No file manager/sd card - a well-known issue, but using it for the first time (or rather not having it available to use) is very annoying o Can't email files - Apple made a big deal about the ability to email pictures from an email draft, but that's all you can email. If you're a business user like me, and you email Office docs and/or PDF files, you're out of luck. o No toggles for Bluetooth or wifi - it's the long way or the highway my friend! o No envelope for text messages - related somewhat to the blinking LED. If you've got messages waiting, you won't know unless you are on the home screen which has the icon for your email/text program - unless you keep those particular icons on the dock. o Can't talk and surf - a Verizon issue (I think Sprint too) but this is annoying - I've spent the last year-plus talking on Bluetooth or speaker and surfing the web while doing so, now I can't because the phone doesn't haef a second radio??? o No user dictionary - those of us who use Android and add words to our dictionaries in order to have them be available while typing are out of luck. You can add some words in the background (in settings) but unlike Android, you don't have the option to show a bunch of words as you type. o No Swype - another thing I knew going in but I underestimated how annoying it was going to be to have to type every letter again and take 3x as long to send a message as I was used to. Battery life isn't all that great, not horrible but coming from a Razr Maxx, this thing is pretty short. All in all, a pretty good phone but not very comprehensive. You'll get more features out of Android, but again, if you are new to smartphones or coming from an earlier Iphone, have at it. You'll love it.
I traded in the RAZR M for the iPhone 5. I'm not tied down to any OS platform and have switched among Android, Windows and iOS handsets. For those who already have a 4S, you can probably pass up on the 5 as it really offers no large benefit in performance from day to day usage, unless you have to have LTE data connectivity. The screen is physically bigger and still an excellent asset for the iPhone, but quality is more or less the same as the 4/4S since the pixel density is still the same; the change in aspect ratio offers benefits for those who will see a few extra lines in the browser or emails. I haven't ran into any of the issues reported by other iPhone 5 users such as the scratched aluminum frame or the odd ball issues with the new Maps application, but the battery life has taken a rather large hit when LTE is enabled; I've had the phone go from full charge to 67% in five hours, whereas the 4S would still be at 85-90% with the same usage scenario. Cellular signal is also still inferior to some of the other handsets I've had; I've never dropped a call with my Motorola RAZR M or Galaxy S 3, but I've dropped two calls already in the last five days of ownership on the iPhone 5. Signal and voice quality is fine when the phone gets excellent signal, but it seems like it doesn't perform as well in less than ideal scenarios. For those with Verizon, you may want to look at the Galaxy S III if you like PC-like hardware specifications in a phone, or the Motorola Razr M for those who prefer a more modest or compact device. Not sure if I will keep this phone or use it to trade for a Windows Phone 8 device in November. The much acclaimed A6 Processor in the iPhone 5 looks like a real winner, but there are not any apps or games right now that takes advantage of it to justify an upgrade over the 4S. Original 4 or older iPhone owners that loves the Apple platform, this is definitely your worthwhile upgrade.
I was talked into this phone by some buddies.... i like it i geuss, heres the thing, i come from android. they said " its got a huge screen" my old phone was .5 inches bigger... they said "its 4g!" so was my old pone... they said "its got siri!" i had google voice. They said "its integrated for facebook" Android has been integrated for as long as i can remember, and on a lot more than face book. Now, i know it sounds like im another android fan dissing the Iphone... im not, this is a great phone. my family members love it. im just not totally impressed, i figure it took them 2 years to release this, why doesnt it have anything state of the art? I was just expecting more. i ended up trading this for an S3 2 days after i got it, because the Droid was too much for my friend and the Iphone was simpler... so there's that :/ I guess to sum it up, If you want a super reliable phone, thats easy for a newcomer to smartphones, backed with great customer service, then go for it, you wont be upset. If you want a small computer that ca make phone calls and do everything and Iphone can and more(alhough, you have to learn to use it) get an android phone (probably the GS3 or Gnex) its not rocket science, get the phone that feels right.
The new iPhone 5 is an awesome smartphone that offers great quality. You appreciate the technology, fluidity, and integration of the product when you "HAVE ONE." Of course, the haters are going to speak out against the iPhone 5 knowing good and well they are only listening to the critics who actually "Have One." Yes, Apple will need to improve on the Maps, Passport feature, and other areas that fell short upon initial release, but what product doesn't? For those who are genuine about evaluating the smartphone, give it a try first then decide. Don't settle for what you hear from the haters, because you can give them 5 brand new iPhone's for free, and guess what, their still gonna hate!
Not sure why the Droid lover has to rate the iphone bad, problem with the droid is they release a new one every week, Ive had my iphone for almost 2 years now and have not had a single problem with it, once i switched from a droid that is loaded down with verizon junk i found that the iphone is the best you can buy for a phone, its easy to use, great features, has 4g now and of course the amazing sensitive HD screen, motorola has to release at least 10 phones before apple releases their next iphone, tells you who is ahead of the game in the phone business. Apple for the WIN!!!
Anyone who says the iPhone5 has a bigger screen and a faster a6 chip is completely right, but they're leaving so many other improvements out! Not only has the new a6 chip made the iPhone 5 faster by boosting speeds close to 2x quicker than the 4s but, it hold efficient battery life at the same time. They've also integrated LTE into the iPhone which speeds up all data usage and can even be faster than your average wifi network. It now allows you to connect with anyone face to face over your carrier network from anywhere in the world, they've combined it with CDMA making processing more efficient overall. Android has proven itself to be inferior time after time, the closest to get near the iPhone is the Samsung glaxy s3, which everyone knows samsung has done nothing but piggy-back off of apple's innovative ways. On top of all that no one is going to touch 326 ppi retna display and intense graphic upgrades from the help of EA. Although Siri may not always work perfectly, they've made huge improvemts as to what she can now task. iSight is breakthrough camera quality to have integrated into any phone, panorama imaging and full HD recording with awesome imaging features such as low-light settings. Let's also not forget that the iPhone is the best looking and sleekest phone on the market. To say Motorola's androids or others can stand anywhere close to apples iOS6 processing speeds and user interface is pure ignorance. Apple reinvented the cell phone and help build the mobile phone market, and now they're dominating it.
Ok the new iPhone is just a bit faster and has a larger screen, Droid has had that for awhile now and I believe that people buy these apples phones for the logo thats it!
Good except for battery. Camera is good. Connections are good.
The features and picture quality are great but call quality is poor. I need to constantly repeat myself when I am talking to someone. It is way too easy to call people in error with a touch screen. I guess my expectations were too high for smart phones. I was disappointed when I could not use SIRI to find I-tunes songs or apps.
Best phone yet from Apple. Bigger screen makes for easier use. Apps continue to be great. Addition of 4G service greatly increases data responsiveness. Storage more than adequate for my needs. Facebook integration is nice, but the fact that it changes how names are listed in Contacts is a little bit of an issue. Native support within iOS for group email would be very beneficial. It exists via smart groups in Address Book on Mac OS X. Also, it would be nice if I could get Siri integration with my Ford Sync handsfree system without having to push the button on the phone; possible solution would be to have Siri accessible from the top power button somehow.
Lighter and faster than iphone4. Not dramatically different from previous version though.
Great phone, Like the new screen size. Would of been happier if it was a little bit bigger, but it is good enough and the battery capacity so far has been great. I like the style of the new design, but durability of new casing is a little bit questionable. I would highly recommend purchasing a protective case. Nothing really ground breaking on this model, but it is a very solid phone.
I have no problems with the battery if I manage location settings and wifi, I get LTE in town 3G at home, and 4G LTE in the city. I use the phone for everything, its an amazing machine for music, photos, and am learning to make and encourage video calls via Skype and Face Time. I experience data connectivity if I connect to wifi at home where I spend a lot of time working. I bought this phone outright to utilize Verizon unlimited data, its great with iTunes and Spotify Pro. Siri is great, no issues with iMaps, google maps on the web, or google earth app. Upload photos to web apps with photo bucket or iCloud, which is great keeping my calendars notes and photos synced and backed up.
Very fast - keeps up with my searches and switching between apps etc Wish Verizon would add the capability to talk and surf the web A bit pricey in comparison to some of the new Samsung phone specs
Over all I am very pleased with my purchase. It keeps me very organized and entertained.
I am very happy with my new Iphone. I had a droid before and was never happy with it. This phone is easy to use and understand. I love the look and feel of it. It syncs effortlessly with my Ipad and Ipod. I love using Siri to text and make lists. The phone is nice and light and fits in all sizes of pockets from my coat to my purse. I had some trouble with texting but Verizon helped me out. I also really like the imessage that makes it possible to text other iphone users for free. The Panorama feature on the camera is a little confusing at first but once you get the hang of it it is a great and fun feature. the camera and video itself is very easy to use and I have gotten some fantastic photos and videos. I love taking photos of my cat (ok, call me crazy), and you can see every hair on her tail! i rarely even carry my camera any more This is my first Iphone and I am very glad I got it, even if it did take so long! I recommend this phone to everyone.
If you want easy to use, feels great in your hands, this and easy to carry around,no hassle everything phone, this is it!
The iPhone 5 is great, but it's just a little faster version of the iPhone 4s with a little bigger screen. The new power cord is 30 dollars, and new cases are limited. The screen is beautiful, but it's just a small iPad with a phone function. I work in sales and drive daily, and need the phone functions. Having on both an Android and an iPhone, the ease of use off the phone function on Android far outweighs the iPhone. IPhone also does not have Google Maps which is superior to Mac's version of maps. I traded my iPhone 5 in for the Samsung Galaxy s3. I believe after using both phones, that the Samsung Galaxy s3 is a much better purchase. It does everything the iPhone 5 does, and much more. It's just as fast and the screen is bigger. Its also cheaper which is a bonus. I also did not have to buy another car charger are home charger, because it works with my old Android universal chargers. If you are wrestling between buying either phone definitely go with the Samsung Galaxy s3, you won't be disappointed
I had an HTC Incredible since its launch and towards the end of its life it became the worst phone I have ever had. Antenna would completely lose its signal randomly and the phone itself required constant maintenance. I upgraded to the iPhone 5 as I already have an all Mac environment in my household. Being able to use iCloud to sync my documents from my Mac (Numbers, Pages, Keynote, and OmniFocus) has been a life saver. I would also recommend getting at least a 32GB as 16GB does not leave much room to do anything unless you want to carry around a Seagate GoFlex Satellite Drive.
I enjoy my iphone for calls, map, checking emails, playing solitare, going on Facebook and taking pictures.
A significant increase in speed and app sustainability comparing to the iPhone 4. Absolutely pleased with this device pronounced as The iPhone 5.
Picked it up two days after in was released and very happy with purchase, Maps is very good, better than my gps by far. Like all the Data phones these days you must turn off apps after use to save the battery, doing that and it last all day. It is the perfect size to hold and I find the flat sides handy to hold it up hands free videoing or watching a clip. The panorama feature is much better than anything else I have used. The operating system makes it so easy to use without some of the confusion of previous data phones.
This is a great phone, it is much faster than the 4 S. However, Apple did not do so well with the mapping issues. But, since I don't use it too often, it's not really that big a deal
The only thing I really don't like about this phone is the fact that I have to get adapters for the chargers I already own due to the new Lighting connector Apple has gone to. Not only are they not readily available in stores, when they are available, they are quite expensive. Eventually this problem should be resolved, but since the phone is so new, they just aren't out there. If you are an Apple fan (and most people who have used Apple products seem to be), you won't be disappointed with this phone. If you're new to Apple, you will find it very easy to use. Some might complain about the Apple proprietary issues (you can't change the phone the way you can an android product), but since I neither know how to nor want to, this is not an issue for me. I like the way my phone works and don't see a need to do all those things to/with it anyway. I'd describe myself as a moderate-techy person, and am very happy with my phone!
Overall this phone is great. The battery life is not great.
Best iPhone yet, apple keeps hitting it out of the park every time they make a new iPhone. The screen size is perfect not to bulky, perfect size for any size hand. I recommend getting one on verizon LTE network. It is lightening fast.
Lovin' it. Got the 32 GB Black and covered it on day one, so I can't speak to the scratching that others have written about. VzW LTE is super fast. It seriously feels much lighter than my 4s.
I would give this higher marks but Verizon does seem to be able to figure how to have the phone keep time and the correct date. When I spoke to the local Verizon store manger he sys he had ever heard of it. Should have gone with AT & T.
Apple products are always well designed and very user friendly. The screen is smooth to the touch and very responsive. It is very light but still has a durable feel. There's lot's of memory and the apps load fast. The Apple map has been working fine for me, but I would have like to be able to choose between the default one and Google's map app. It's a pleasure to use everyday.
I had the original iPhone, then I switched to an Android based smartphone for about 2 years, now I'm back to the iPhone 5. I love how simple everything just works. Easy to setup, easy to use. Everything integrated. Android is great if you want to modify the look of your phone, and change a bunch of settings... but sometimes you can get too bogged down with customizing every little thing. And being able to modify so much stuff does come at a price. Usability goes down. Ability of getting everything working together goes down. The iPhone 5 is fast. Easy to use. Has tons of apps. A great feature of the new lightning connector is that you can plug it in any way. There is not "top" or "bottom". Its a simple simple change, that seems so insignificant, but now, I can't imagine, why every plug isn't designed this way. Why do you need to mess with plugging it in the right way. I've dropped my phone a few times. On carpet, and gravel. The screen is much more durable now. No issues. The iOS Maps may be an issue for some people, but I've used them alot to look for phone numbers and addresses of stores near me ( Orange County Ca ) and have not had any issues. And the turn-by-turn navigation is AMAZING! I loved TBT on my old Android phone, google based. The iOS version just blows it away. It has the "Apple polish" that makes it so much more appealing.
A lot of other phones do more for less. Don't get me wrong, this is a nice phone but a lot of the androids will eat this up. I love apple but I have also owned a galaxy nexus. I would recommend you keep the droid and don't fall victim to the hype. Also, get ready to buy all new cords for the iPhone 5.
Another evolutionary win for Apple. The upgrade from the 4 was well worth the new features, and LTE is fast! (When you have coverage at least) Very satisfied, and would recommend to anyone coming from an iPhone 4 or earlier. A bit disappointed that all the Lightning connectors weren't available at launch (still aren't) but nobody, not even Apple, is perfect.
I picked this up September 21st a week after I preordered it and I can't be happier. It's thin, light, and the 4" screen is just beautiful. The response times are lightning quick and the battery life lasts longer than any other phone. I had the samsung galaxy s III but I had to exchange it after two weeks and I'm so glad I did. This is much more compact and easier to operate with one hand only. If youre debating between the two get the iPhone you won't regret it. Who needs more than 32/64GB on a cell phone anyway?there is no need for an SD card this is plenty of storage. The phone just feels better its casing is metal as opposed to the plastic on the Samsung making it more durable and you can't lower the volume or shut it down by accident because the side buttons aren't as sensitive and misplaced as on the galaxyS III. The best phone I ever had.
So far so good. I have had it for 60 days and still happy that i upgraded from the 4s.
Great phone. So much you can do with it and there's probably an App for anything. Battery life is my only complaint
This phone is over price and nothing spectacular like everybody make u believed plus you need hook it io to the pc for everything
It seemed a little small at first (previous phone was an EVO) but now I'm used to the size and really enjoy carrying a smaller device.
Phone was returned because of dropped calls. This may have been the fault of the carrier providing service as family members using I-4S phones service with other carriers had no problems from my location. Make sure your carrier provides good service for your usage location. Explore Verizon and AT&T.
I love this phone. It is small enough for one hand usage. The camera is very nice and produces great images even when the light is low. This phone actually replaced one of my digital point and shoot cameras. The HD video recorder is awesome. The only thing I don't like is that the phone moves very slow on the 3G network. Can't wait until Sprint gets 4G LTE towers in my area.
I upgraded from a 4s and although there wasn't much of an upgrade I love the longer screen and the picture quality. This phone has everything I want in a phone.
This is the best purchase I had made in a while. Easy to use and works great for me.
The iPhone 5 for sprint is a good phone. LTE is really fast and the camera is really nice. Problem is that the black iPhone scratches way to easily which if your like me may p*** you off. Paying so much for something that scratches so easy. I would give the phone a 5 star except for the scratches that can occur so simple
Great phone , camera and product overall ! Apples best phone yet didn't think it could get any better cant wait too see what's in store for the next device ! Good performance great battery life ! Size is perfect !!!! You'll absolutely love !!!!
Best phone I have ever had and I have been using cell phones since they were in bags.
All in all the iPhone5 is a good phone, but it is still severely lacking in a few areas. Yes, the screen is a tad bigger, but it's still not where it should be. The biggest complaint I have, by far, is NO JAVA or FLASH. I really get sick and tired of not being able to go to websites that require Java or flash and this brand new state of the art phone from the likes of Apple, won't work on these sites. It's terribly annoying. When the phone switches to roaming I sometimes lose my call. Oftentimes, even though it shows 3G coverage, it still won't connect to the internet. Haven't connected to 4G. On the positive side the phone charges incredibly fast. Just can't believe how long it's taken Apple to get the accessories to market.
I have had androids for the last three years and I almost used my upgrade for a 4s last year but decided to hold off to see if the next iPhone would have a larger screen. It's something that I really liked about my Evo. Although its not as large as I would have hoped, I think they hit a good balance of size and usability. The biggest plus has to be battery life. With my android I had three chargers. Home, car, office and I basically moved my phone from one to the other. With the 5, the only time it's on a charger is when I'm driving. That's it. Which is about an hour a day. Great phone and no problems so far. I've had it since launch and I couldn't be happier.
ok, maybe if we had 4g lte here in spokane this phone woulda wowed me, but with the processor being limited by 3g, it wasn't any better than the iPhone 4S my wife uses. maps sucked, and ios 6 wont let me use google maps. i figure my available upgrade is worth, what... 500 bucks? until we get 4g lte, it's gonna take more than siri and itunes store to use that upgrade for something not much better than i already got. i took back the iPhone 5 and am gonna hold out for the Samsung Note 2, which is spozed to drop the end of october.
It is my first IPhone. I enjoy it but not so happy with the battery life. if I need to go long distance, car charger is a must.
I love this phone. It does everything I'm so glad I upgraded.
I upgraded from a Blackberry to the iPhone 5. It was between this and the Galaxy SIII. Everyone kept telling me I'd love the iPhone, so I decided to give it a try and they were right. It's clean and I can keep everything organized. It also really easy learn and to use.
Great overall phone. Very comfortable to hold and use. It has a great camera and the panoramic option is awesome. The navigation work great, about the same as my HTC EVO. Very happy I switched to Apple since I already have 5 other apple products, make syncing very easy!
The phone is pretty good the durability is greatly increased the phone is lighter and thinner. Apple was totally Unprepared to release IOS 6 and the Iphone 5. Battery Charge was supposed to be better , its not .the Maps misguide you.There are no available Accessories to adapt to old docks and there are no new docks out yet..and it seems that passwords are not required for some blue tooth functions and Itunes which makes me wonder about security issues..
Great phone! Easy to use and navigate. Enjoy sleek new look
i upgraded from the iphone 4 and alot of the features are still the same but how can u really improve upon a already perfect product. im not happy with sprint service but otherwise everything with the iphone 5 is just great
The screen size and resolution is wonderful; the speakers are nice and loud. It still seems to run as slow as my 4S did. I have LTE in my area, but it rarely turns on. I would love to be on LTE all the time. The battery life doesn't seem to be any better either; I have used my phone a lot though since it is new. I hate that I don't have an extra charger for my car yet. I ordered one from Apple's website, but it won't be ready to ship until October. Overall, I am very happy with the phone, but it doesn't seem to match the hype.
Great quality and easy to use, also works great with My other Apple products.
The iPhone 5 is great and all for the average businessman or high-end job holder, but my biggest worry is the 4G-LTE. It may be RIDICULOUSLY fast right now, but that's because not too many people are using it; give it a year or so, and the 4G-LTE hype will die down and carriers will soon have to make a 5G network for web users, and by the time that does happen, an iPhone 5S will probably be out by then too.... the only reason why I bought this phone was because of the fabled 4G-LTE, but the more that I think about it, the more I realize that the 4G-LTE is just going to become like its predecessor, the 3G network.
First time iPhone user. Just swiched from Android. When compared to the Android, the iPhone is definitely easier to use but much more limited in things that you can do. Plus the same app's that are free on Android costs a couple bucks on the iPhone app store. Overall its a decent phone, but I think the iPhone is overhyped. It really comes down to personal preference and how tech savy you are. If you want an easy to use phone go with iPhone. If you have above average tech skills, go with an Android.
I returned the iphone after 14 days...waited for the note 2 to come out...it was one of the best decisions I made regarding cell phones! The note impressed me right when I turned it on! The iphone made me mad because all this hype about how great it is and when I got it...it turned out to be unimpressive at best....the treo that I had 6 years ago did more than the iphone 5 does now!
Over all I am very satisfied with my purchase of the iPhone 5. I have had a blackberry and 2 androids and now the iPhone. I have a Mac Pro, iPad 2 and an iPod nano, and I felt that the iPhone would be a great addition. It was a little rough at first with getting used to iOS 6 but I am learning more and more daily. I put the signal as a con because my 3G is not as good as my android. I have to go to certain parts of my house in order for people to hear me. The battery life is great to me. I already charged every day at bedtime but now I can charge every 1 1/2 days, depending on how much I use the phone. I was not disappointed by the small charger because I don't have tons of equipment that I have to have the adaptor for. The camera is really nice and I haven't tried the panorama yet, but I hear its nice. I also love that the display actually dims with the light around you. Not too bright in the dark and bright enough in the light. I am disappointed that Sprint didn't opt for the 2 antennas to talk and surf at the same time, although I didn't have it with my androids, I would have loved to have it with my iPhone. Overall, I am happy with my phone.
I used to have a HTC-EVO and upgraded to an iPhone, and I'm glad I did. Although I have Sprint, the processing with the iPhone is so much faster and I never have any problem while using it at work where it's hard to get a signal unlike the EVO where it always failed me before. The resolution is very clear and crisp. The size of the phone itself is comfortable in your hands and doesn't make any difference to me. I haven't used the earbuds yet but I liked that it came in it's own case that way I can keep it untangled in my purse. I found out that the charger's USB cord fits right in to my old HTC-EVO charger, so I just need to get an extra ligthning cord to take along with me in the car. Battery life last a long time, and it helps that I turned off some apps feature to save more power. I know I wrote price as a drawback but I'm glad I got a 32GB. It says that of the 32GB I used 2.6GB but also listed the available storage only as 25.4GB. So I think some of it's storage GB is already consumed by the preloaded apps. I haven't uploaded it yet with my music, videos and books. I bought a case for it right away so I haven't proven how easily it gets scratched as I've heard from other users I know. (And I don't want to find out :))....
I had the original htc evo 4g and loved the android operating system. Only reason I went with the iPhone was because of how much I used my iPad. I have had the phone for a week and can't put it down. The iOS operating system is smoother and user friendly. The phone is gorgeous fits in my hand and incredibly light. I worried about the smaller screen from the androids and seriously considered the S3 but after using the iPhone 5 I have realized that yes, the screen size matters and it can get too big. The retina display is amazing and the camera is just as good as a stand alone. I had to take pictures of a car accident and the pictures are crystal clear and shows every detail. Even from 20 feet away. I don't know of I will ever go back to the android system.
I was an android fan, tried Iphone 4s in 2011, did not like it returned it back to android, now bought Iphone 5 on launch day, as I was tired of apps instability on android and also the fragmentation and google not having any control. Also gave android 3 yrs to mature and decided to try ios again and could not be happier, yes the screen could have been 4.5", but 4" is not bad either, as I wanted phone to have at least 4" screen.
I bought the first iPhone didn't really like it but I needed to get a new phone works super fast response with Siri is great don't ask multiple questions gets confused but besides that great pic light weight battery life is amazing if you listen to music with out disturbing the phone in one location will last past 8hr surf the Internet great battery all around great phone .
This iPhone is great. I didn't have a problem paying 299 for this because I use it all the time. I notice a faster response on some applications with the a6 chip. Siri is also very helpful.
I love this phone. My prior phone was am HTC Evo 4G with an extra battery. The difference in weight between my old phone and this iPhone is striking and a little bit unsettling. Now a warning for Sprint customers: there was some trouble with the 3G data in the beginning. After almost four weeks of frustration, Apple sent out an update via Restore and the Sprint directed me to erase all data and re-activate. Things seem better now, but be advised.
I got the iPhone the first day it dropped. I haven't been able to put it down. I love how it communicates between my MacBook Pro & my iPad2. Highly recommend this phone! No other phone comes even close to the iPhone.
I am familiar with phones that use the Android system and phones that use IOS. After leaving Android I made the switch to the Iphone 4s (purely for convenience because it seemed to merge my Ipod touch with a phone so I only needed to carry one device instead of two). The iphone 4s was my first iphone and I was very happy with it. I like the thin lightweight body of the Iphone 5 but I traded my iphone 4s in for the Iphone 5 mainly becuase of the larger screen. I have had excellent call quality and everything has worked smoothly as it did on my previous iphone. The phone's battery life has been as good or better than the Iphone 4s (I made it 26 hours without a charge; used it as a phone, music player, surfed the internet and checked facebook from time to time). If you are thinking about getting an Iphone 5 I highly recommend it. In my opinion other than screen size you won't notice a huge difference in the iphone 4s vs the Iphone 5, but I sold my iphone 4s for almost the cost of the new Iphone 5 upgrade price so for me it was worth the trade. I opted for 64g because my previous phone was 64g as well, I had already surpassed the 16g capacity but had not used 32gs, but I figure with a 2 year contract and app sizes getting larger not to mention the size of pictures and videoes now that they are HD, and the lack of expandable memory, I decided to go with the larger one. But even though my Android phone boasted expandable sd memory, only certain apps would go there, and there was only aproximately 1g worth of space on the phone for apps that would not go to the external memory. So a finite amount of space effects users of both systems I suppose. The bad if any so far, would be the price of the phone, for example, $200 difference in the 16g and the 64g phone when most 48gs of flashdrive space do not cost $200. I bought my phone at the Lexington, Ky store on Nicholasville, Rd and Dustin/salesman was very knowledgable and helpful in doing my upgrade.
Best phone I've ever owned. Not too big like other phones.
Great phone, significantly faster than previous models, everything you need/want. Very easy to use. Best phone to date.
For the price, battery issues should have been resolved before release, Software fixes after purchasing is not acceptable. Too top heavy to use one handed for its size. I returned it and am going with another phone for less price, but more self setting capabilities.
This is my first IPhone and I love it. Siri works great. Facetime is awesome and works well on a 3G network. Cloud synching works very well. The only knock I have is the battery life but it's still better than the EVO I used to have.
I have used an Android phone for the last couple of years. EVO 4G. While overall it was a great phone to begin with, over time it got worse and worse. I have only had this phone for a week and a half, but so far I love it. All the gripes I read online about it seem to be minimal in my eyes or people that are just too picky about certain things. The phone works and works well. I had an ipod touch, so everything I purchased or downloaded for that seamlessly transferred via the icloud to the iphone. I waited for things to download while I synced it and charged it for the first time and everything was there. It actually started downloading my apps and everything the minute I signed into my apple account. I have only used the maps and gps once or twice, but it worked when I used it. I know there are flubs, but definitely not a deal breaker. They will have these very small issues worked out within the span of me owning the phone, so no big deal. Battery life has been great so far. It lasts through the day. The phone's speed is a huge improvement and I love 4g lte speed when it's on. I know Sprint is working on this as well and it won't be long before this is on all the time. Bottom line though, in a week and a half or so, I have not lost a signal or dropped any calls. I have always been online, so the coverage has been great. If you like a phone in your pocket, this is the lightest and thinnest you will find. Hardly notice it's there. Great phone overall. Highly recommended.
the iPhone 5 its a good phone just not on sprint!! you get unlimited internet at print but super slow internet ,its the worst service i ever had on internet !! don't buy this phone for sprint carrier
I sold my Iphone 4G and purchased the iphone 5. The 5 is easy to navigate and picture quality is great. I carry it everywhere I go because it is my MP3 player, recorder, photo library, video library, and fastest connection to the people I care about.
4G Lte is faster than all third party wifi I have witnessed and sometimes faster than my Brighthouse RR Lightning wifi at home. Larger screen allows for more favorite apps on Home Screen A6 processor is significantly faster than Iphone 4 models. battery still drains quickly
As always with an apple product you get the best of the best. This is my 2nd apple phone and its better than my 4 and I would never own any other phone. I've had the rest now I have the best. Great phone, worth the money, user friendly my 4yr old has mastered it!
I have had the opportunity of owning every model of iPhone starting with the 3. In this occasion Apple again has constructed an incredible piece of technology, you will notice it by how it feels, solid and elegant. The screen is nicer than you can expect. Size wise is perfect and as you will find out the operating system is easy to learn. The back of it has silver coat that is great looking. Overall performance, looks and feels are excellent.
Am really enjoying this easy to use cell. It is light weight, 4G network is super fast, camera is awesome, the apps are great, the sound is awesome, battery life is excellent.
I love the battery life and I love how thin they have made it.
I have had all of the previous iphone models. I must say this was not an upgrade at all. Apple has yet to innovate there devices. I exchanged my phone and got a galaxy s 3. I was very disappointed, the screen on the iPhone was longer but the letter size was smaller. honestly I saw no differences between this model and the iPhone 4S. Beats me why people go crazy for this phone. I definitely do no recommend it at all. Save your money and just get the iPhone 4S if you must have an apple product.
I love all of the little things that changed, like the addition of Reminders, the quick launch for the camera (no more missed shots), being able to delete songs from your iPod, updating the phone on the phone. I upgraded from a 3g so I'm in love with the 5!
This is our 3rd iPhone model and we just like how the product operates. It's stick, lighter, and has a larger viewing area. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this product and one of our children who was a Andriod diehard switched to the iPhone 5 which we were very pleased.
I'm happy with the phone. The only problem is the battery life is short so I have to be charging all the time.
Not much different from 4S. However, am having problems with background voices heard by people I have called. They report hearing pieces of other people's conversations during our calls. After so many people telling me this, I finally called AT&T and was told to reboot my phone. Then was told that maybe it was because I was using speaker. Always used speaker with previous phones and never any problem. Makes me wonder if others are hearing pieces of my conversations. Kind of sorry I did not keep the 4S.
I've had iPhones before and I love them. I upgraded from the 4, skipped the 4s, and I have to say that I am surprised. You here that it is just a stretched out iPhone but you just don't understand until you start using it how great the screen is. I can reach every part of the screen and it hasn't gotten larger in a way that sacrifices usability or comfort. I assumed it would be faster and surely haven't been disappointed. One thing that gets me is just how light the iPhone 5 is, it's just crazy! You also hear folks complain about the new lightning connector but its small, really sturdy, charges super fast and the connector itself is waterproof so I don't see what all the fuss is about. Overall a great phone!
I waited for the Iphone5 to finally come out so I could upgrade my Iphone 3GS. The new Iphone5 is a taller device, has a great display, easy to use and extremely fast most of the time when in the LTE areas. If you are use to an Iphone as I am you will enjoy the same ease of use. I briefly switched to a Samsung Sky Rocket which was large and very fast being an LTE device, but if you are use to the Iphone OS it makes the switch hard. While I had the Sky Rocket I experience troubles with some operation one being the camera not working properly so I gave up and went back to my Iphone3GS and waited for the Iphone5. Overall the Iphone5 is a great phone to use.
This is my third iPhone and I love it even more than the last version! The camera takes excellent pictures! Although, I've yet to master the panoramic picture function. The new chargers are easier to connect, but I don't like that fact that I have to purchase an adapter for my existing chargers (car and docking station) for an additional $30 - $40. I've yet to be able to get my adapters (even from Apple) and think they should've been available when phone released!
If you have wifi on at home and try to send a pic to anyone that's not a iPhone member they do not get the pic unless you turn wifi off. I was told by att that its happening to alot of ppl and hopefully it should be fix soon!!
its a great phone for practicably anyone, its easy to use and easy to master
Defective phone with no reacement available since purchase over 6 weeks ago. From day one my phone has been deffective
I waited for Apple to release the iPhone 5 for at least a year. I went from a 3G to the 5 and WOO HOO!!! It is so worth the wait. The images are so crisp and clear. The new LTE makes it superfast. And of course, it's an Apple...so easy to operate. And trustworthy apps! LOVE IT!!!
iPhone 5 is wonderful, easy to use and fun. Beautiful colors are in the pictures on the screen, good sound quality, and interesting to use, much like my iMac. Glad I have it!!! Use it every day for more then just phone calls. Suri is great for reminders and information. Also makes phone calls from my computer contact list. But not easy to learn, need the manual for information on how to do things, and also took a class at the Apple Store, yet I still have much to learn. But it is fun to learn new things.
Love this phone and all it's features. Fast loading. Holds battery life. Great phone!!!!
Great phone overall, easy to use and support is great
Very well put together phone, easy to use and really good quality.
amazing phone! would recommend to everyone! there is no better phone on the market!!
Love my new IPhone 5. Love the bigger screen. It's fast. It's reliable. I use it for everything. Siri really helps a lot when I'm driving a commercial vehicle while at work. I can speak to Siri through my Bluetooth and send and recieve texts, as well as get directions. They do need to do some work on their Maps app. The turn by turn directions sound terrible and often the first part of the spoken directions gets cut off so you only hear half of what is said. I'm sure they'll fix this soon with an update. I was reall hoping they were going to make the new iPod Nano in to a Bluetooth watch that you could use to control your phone but maybe sometime in the future.
Would recommend this device to anyone with a iPhone4 or earlier.
Battery life seems longer. Thinner and lighter. Don't like how it has everything all the older versions have once they are updated. So only thing new about it is that the screen is a lil bigger its thinner and lighter. I am told often that I sound like I am in a tunnel. I have restored and it got better but started again. Sometime I am told That someone called but never got a call.
Apple has innovation and quality is excellent. Love dealing with apple instead if a cell phone carrier if I have issues.
Phone is okay not a difference between iPhone 5 and 4. Save your money. Maybe iPhone 6 will have new features that will make you have to have it.
This phone is everything that iras said about it. Great pictures extremely fast 4g LTE is wicked fast on this device!! Best phone ever!!!
I pre-ordered the iPhone October 15th and had it for about two weeks now. I have no complaints but it does use up data faster than my previous android phone, which is to be expected with LTE, screen, etc... Some apps have not yet updated to support the iPhone 5 and some people may complain about the thin black strips on the right and left of the screen, but it is no big deal, even with a white iPhone and should not be a deal breaker for anyone. The camera is great and the video sound quality actually really surprised me because of how clear your could hear voices. The new charging connector seems to charge the phone faster then the previous one does, and for the maps, I have had no problems with either. I would recommend this to any person in the market for a new smartphone because of the speed, reliability and speed. And for the people saying the iPhone 5 is not enough of an upgrade from the 4s, ignore them. If Apple changes too much, people complain, if they change too little, they complain.
This is best iphone apple created. I got it one first week itself.
Love the phone can't not go anywhere with out .very versatile
it's a great phone. it's alot faster than my 4. I'm glad I updated
Its an iphone, little better then the last not as good as the next version
i was expecting a larger screen. We seniors have an issue with small things. i did like the GPS with voice interaction. Siri is great but it will not give me an audible alert (or did i miss someting?). Apple could have let us continue to use our old accessories..but NOOOOOOOO, gotta make an extra buck.
Just as I loved the iPhone 4 and 4S the iPhone 5 is yet another great addition to the iPhone family. It is the fastest smartphone I have ever used and the call quality is even better than past generations.
I've been an iPhone user since the 3g. I upgraded from the 4. I was sort of hesitant at first, but am glad I made the upgrade. The screen is larger and looks a lot better. The sound has improved. The earbuds are sweet. Siri is pretty neat. If you are a 4 user or below upgrading is a no brainer.
I am satisfied going from a 3GS to this. Love the improved maps app, Siri is cool to have, noticeable bigger screen, fast Processing, etc.
To be fair, it's a good device, iphone still goes beyond of most categories of smart phones. But what can you do when the battery dies so quickly? I don't use much app, not even a heavy texter, more than 90% time of a day I let my phone stand by. But I have to charge the phone twice everyday to make sure I won't miss income-calls. Whenever the battery shows low when I'm outside, I start to worry if it can last till I got power outlet. It makes my life suffering. I don't understand why do apple pursuing the thinness so much. Don't they see how thick the cases are that people put on the iphone? When I knew iphone has bigger screen, I was expecting better battery lifes. But turns out that it's even worse than iphone 4S and Samsung galaxy that I used to own.
I love the new screen size, it is lightening quick. LTE (in available areas) is also lightening quick.
Overall I love it!!! Everything about is great!! I love the bigger screen, the camera is the best. Also safari is a bit faster..
I love this device. I really love Siri and voice dictation. It's nice to pay bills while on the go. My life revolves around iTunes and it works perfect with it.
Ridiculous to have another plug. Why have a completely different one that the other Apple products or standard plugs for all other cell phones?
The one thing I liked about this phone is its feel in hand. The phone is great in hands and looks solid. The work externally is exquisite. I am an Android OS user and felt all the mobile phones were lacking the solid build as iphone 5. However one cannot go by the experience of the hardware alone. I didnt like the iphone 4s due to its dimensions as the iphone4 but this iphone 5 is niche and top quality. If anyone is looking for buying a device for the 200 bucks range go for it. If you can spend more get the Samsung note 2. I would suggest anyone to have a whole new experience and not stick to the same OS. Please switch OS to see how it fares against competition. If i had already used an iphone, I wouldnt have opted for this one. At the end of the day you want something new to work with and not be stuck with the same look and feel for years. Also the processing prowess is much more compared to the older versions and some of the older versions of Android phones. Also if you are a person who would like the google experience on a solid phone get this one and install all the google apps. They work well and you get the best of both worlds.
I've owned an iPhone since the 3G, and I've never been disappointed with apple yet.. The only thing that bothers me about the iPhone 5 is how the headphone jack is on the bottom. Maybe it's just me, but overall still a great phone!
Great phone bigger screen, good camera the panoramic feature is awesome
It would be nice to be able to customize the lock screen. Other then that,it works great.
Went from the iPhone 3GS to the 5 and the improvement is amazing! Night and day between the two, so for those of you thinking of upgrading to the 5, it's worth it. I will say that there is marginally better battery life compared to the 3GS, so that's nothing to have a parade about, but everything else is. The camera's filming and picture taking capabilities are very crisp and clear.
I like the phone overall for the features it has. I phones have always been a very high quality product and reliable. I do not like the battery life. They claim that it has better battery life than previous versions, but it does not. I still do like the phone and I would not trade it for anything else on the market.
This is a great upgrade from the iPhone 4 I previously had, in every department! Feels a good deal lighter too.
Needs stronger antenna, screen could be a little wider, could be much faster
Very fast Internet. Excellent pictures. Good first time phone. Siri sometimes don't understand me but all in all works well.
Upgraded from an iPhone 4 16gb to iPhone 5 16gb - smooth transition. I like having Siri to assist with some hands free. The slightly larger screen is nice and it weighs less than the iPhone 4. The 4G LTE seems very fast. I am on AT&T
I have had iPhones since the second gen. It is my opinion that are just a better built phone. Also it is the only phone that I can sync with outlook without paying another 50 bucks for software. Yes the screen could be bigger ( even on the 5) and I don't like that you can't change the battery yourself. I still love this phone and its perfect for my needs
This is the best iphone yet. I have no complaints.
The clarify is fantastic, reception perfect and everything works great
iPhones are, by far, the easiest cell phone I've ever used; wouldn't even consider a Droid -- too complicated!
First off, I received this phone flawless, without the scuffs users have been reporting, but put in a cover as soon as I got it, just in case. I use Poetic Atmosphere for those curious, and I am very pleased with it. Moving on to the phone, it really is excellent. Although it may not appeal to those with an iPhone 4S, any other phone owners, including iPhone 4 and even Galaxy S3, should seriously consider this phone. Simply taking it out of the box, I could feel just how light, and high quality it was. Its hardware quality is breathtaking, and its thin and super lightweight design truly stands as a benchmark for all phones to go by. Now, turning the phone on, I immediately noticed it booted faster into the setup than any other device I have seen. It was a simple process, and pretty soon I was on the familiar iOS screen. For those wondering, iOS 6 is a very useful update, but the maps is inferior compared to Google Maps. It has some useful features, and is in no way "bad", but it seems like Apple took a step down in replacing Google Maps. However, this being the only issue, it was manageable. The iOS software provides an amazing, zippy experience and a reliably smooth as well. In this aspect, it dwarfs competitors such as Google's Android JellyBean, which may run smooth and "faster than ICS" most of the time, but is subject to lag now and then, making it unreliable. Finally, I want to talk about the call quality, camera and battery life. Battery life is exactly what you'd expect from a typical Apple product, about 1 whole day of usage. Takes very little time to charge 0-100% with the new Lightning Connector, about 1.5 hours. Nothing special there. However, the camera has to be one of the BEST smartphone cameras in the market right now. Picture quality is superb, with all the sharpness of the 4S with better colors. Video looks even better with video stabilization. The front facing camera is very much an improvement over previous generations, and will fare you well during a Facetime / Skype call. At&t in my area get very good LTE speeds, about 10-15 MB/S, and call quality was very good, with 4 microphones built into the phone. All in all, this phone truly is spectacular. Though it may not be a huge update and have completely redesigned software, this incremental update is exactly what was necessary. It is easily the best smartphone in the market right now, unless of course, you absolutely MUST have Android. However in my case, iOS is a better experience and will serve most of you well too. I would reccomend this phone to anyone with plans to buy a smartphone, as long as it is in their budget.
Im very dissapointed in this phone. I had a feeling I might regret uprading from the 4s and I should have listened to myself. Its a major letdown. The .5 inch increase in size is nice but still not up to the takes of other more powerful smartphones. I will now have take a hit trading this phone in for what I should have gotten to begin with, and S3 or a note 2.
I would not recommend using your upgrade unless you have to if u already have an iphone because essentially its the exact same except for a bigger screen and lighter weight. on a good note though, the upgraded maps are way better for use as a gps
While I waited for almost an year to upgrade my phone because I had high hopes for iPhone 5, this new phone failed to inspire me. I still got it because I use Macbook pro and iPad, and did not want to compromise on compatibility of my products. I still think, other smart phones in the market have more to offer than the iPhone5.
This phone left me missing my iPhone 4S. It has some really great characteristics. I love how thin and light it is. It slides into my pocket very easily and isn't too visable through my pants. The camera is also very good. iOS is basically a very stable, usable interface, and your Apple ID comes with some free iCloud space, which is great. The larger screen is nice, but not as useful as you might expect, especially considering that most apps don't take advantage of the larger screen and leave you with a black bar on the top and bottom of the screen. This doesn't sound so bad except when you consider that the placement of your keyboard now has a black bar below it, so your while your thumbs are trained to tap the spacebar at the bottom of the screen you actually hit the black bar and nothing happens. It would have been much better it they put one, wider black bar at the top of the screen and pushed the keyboard to the bottom but they didn't. Also, Apple made the system requirements make no sense. You can use 12 year olf Windows XP but not Mac OS 10.5.8?
Of course getting the iPhone 5 upgrade was the best, but being able to pre-order and be given an appointment to come in to receive my phone was absolutely amazing. I will do this again next time.
The iPhone 5 is by far the best smartphone to ever hit the market. The new design makes the phone much lighter, battery life is greatly improved over the previous model and the LTE speed is phenomenal! The only drawback -- the ease and speed of use makes it tempting to record lots of video and download lots of apps, eating up the 16GB pretty quickly. My suggestion, shell out the extra $100 for the 32 GB model. Oh, and invest in a Otterbox.
Coming from a previous Samsung Galaxy S III user I can assure you that the Apple iPhone 5 is STILL the king of the smartphones. It's really this simple... it's better in every way. You have a better marketplace with better implemented apps, and a larger variety of apps as well. Yes, it's a huge selling point, and even apps represented on both platforms always seem less well done on Android. Also, the screen size simply makes more sense. Even Samsung recognizes how ridiculous their 4.8" screen is, coming out with a new mini version that is... drum roll please.... the same size as the iPhone 5. Although I have to say, if you like to watch video, the Samsungs screen was really nice to have.... but how often does that really happen? You also get all of latest iOS updates and never have to worry about manufacturer and carrier bloatware delays that can last months like you do with Android. And to be frank, iOS is a better user experience. It's easier to use and they've clearly put more research into what users like, and how they think. Ice Cream Sandwich relied heavily on the hardware buttons for navigation, which is so 10 years ago. And battery life was terrible, causing you to cut the hardwares impressive specs at it's knees with power/battery savers just to make it through the work day. Guys, I've owned both phones, and Apple is still the leader. Yes, there are others trying to copy their success, and they are getting closer, but they still haven't gotten it right. Apple has created an ecosystem of vendors, support, 3rd part accessories, and a marketplace that trumps everything else, and it's not even close.
This is the best cell phone on the market. Very fast internet access, great sound quality, and huge screen. The camera is remarkable, as it has capabilities beyond what I thought I'd ever have in any camera. Those are just my highlights. This phone offers so much more. Check it out. As an owner, I would highly recommend a good case. Also, the Zagg invisible shield for the screen is a fantastic companion.
Great phone with new features that dazzle-I like siri but some friends do not-nice feature for everyday answers-phone is light and easy to carry even with a case-I had an I phone 4S previously and it was great but this is an improvement in weight-bigger screen is appreciated and the back being aluminum makes sense as I had no problem with the 4S but a friend dropped his and the back shattered which is a needless problem The extended battery life is much appreciated and worth the price of the difference compared to older Iphones-I am in to purchasing american products although this is not made in America it is an american company and that is worth something to me
Product is great. Easy to navigate. Audio insert on bottom is something I have to get familiar with. If you can afford another charger I suggest buying it bc battery will not last an entire 8 hours with use.
This is an awesome phone. Apple has always managed to provide a good quality built product. This is my second Iphone I have owned. My first was a 3gs had it 2 years then went to windows phone for 2 years as I have been a Microsoft-Windows fan all my life. I have since bought a mac book pro and now an iphone5 which sync beautifully together.
These phones jus keep getting better and better. The panorama picture option eliminates the need for the Photosynh app. E camera takes really good quality pics and videos for a phone. The numbe of quality apps available is best in class.
I have had 3G iPhone and 4G iPhone. This phone, iPhone5, is faster with better picture quality. Also, has faster network with 4G LTE. Quality of Facetime depends on faster network. 4G LTE allows you to experience smooth Facetime conversation with anyone. It helps, especially, if you are Deaf.
Best phone ever! This is my first iPhone, but it surpassed all expectations!
This is the best mobile phone I have ever had. It does so much more than anticipated such as syncing with my other devices, Apple TV AirPlay Mirroring wirelessly for on the spot presentations, Siri (great for sports schedules, scores, weather, etc.), easier to read screen/display, better camera/video recorder, more calling options, faster speed and more. It keeps me up-to-date with family and friends around the world!
I was an early adopter of the original iPhone, ( no I did not wait in line for three months ). I waited for the iPhone 4 and got a 4S for my wife last Christmas. I like Apple products because they just work out of the box. We both have an iPhone and an iPad.
Battery life poor -goes from 100% to 20% in 4 hours - this is wifi being on, notifications turned off, etc
iPhone 5 is the best phone I've had so far. I've had the previous iPhone's(3 & 4s) & android phones. This phone blows them all out of the water.
I had never owned an iPhone and when I got the iPhone 5 I remembered why. The so called innovation that was made for the iPhone 5 is not innovation at all, 3 years ago phones had faster speeds than iPhone (apple finally caught up), camera is worse than 4s it gets this terrible purple glare when the sun is around (which is most of the time, I have tons of iPod accessories and docks (non of my docks work, after installing about 2gigs of apps it gets incredibly slow and glitchy, the material around the rim gets easily chipped when its in a case, having it in a case takes away the only good thing about this phone which is the design, it sometimes doesn't post or send pictures, and doesn't even have NFC support yet. My old htc Titan was better than this. I wanted to use this phone for both personal and business use, but I a returning it for the Nokia lumia 920 for personal, and getting a Samsung gs3 for work. Very disappointed with apple.
The larger screen size is welcomed. Apple had fallen behind in screen size and the previous iPhones look puny compared to newer models on the market. Screen is clear and OS is intuitive and easy to use. Maps are terrible, phone gets hot, battery life is short and Apple has done something to the previously excellent camera. Images no longer have the same color saturation and focus is not as sharp. It's a mystery why Apple brought this phone to market when it did. I am sure the shortcomings will be corrected, but for now, the iPhone 5 is a disappointment.
The phone is just like the 4s nothing diffenrent. Most app cant funtion the whole screen. The design is easy to get scatch even if in thd case. I would wait for the iphone 6 but for now i just use the galaxy s3 must better..
I tough It would be the same has the 4s but I was wrong... LTE is really fast, the A6 chip makes the phone run smooth and fast the color saturation is one of the best features I like, the 4' display is more vivid like the s3... The camera got better low light the speaker is more loud I love it i can now watch YouTube without the headphones when I'm home, for me the battery last longer some people say is the same overall is the best iPhone yet!! I did make the right choices... The only thing I would like it if iOS got widgets or more widgets in the notification center.
I upgraded from a 4s and think it was well worth it. The bigger screen, better picture quality and LTE made it a no brainer.
Bought at the day it was released. Everything was fine until I discovered a paint chip. Also the Wifi was having issues, couldn't find the networks and doesn't stay connected. Talked to apple and got a replacement a week later. Wifi issue still exists. No scuffs at the beginning, but now have a very small one. I guess the new design has flaws and hopefully apple would correct these issues. Other than that the phone is nice, very light and the processor is pretty fast. The map as we know is below the competition. Overall OK device except for cosmetic issues.
Let's see: 4-in. screen, sealed case with a non-removable battery, Apple Maps has lots of flaws and redirects to Google Maps anyway, still stuck with only syncing to one computer. Only positive is the fast A6 processor, except that it's manufactured by Samsung. This is what we waited for?
This is the phone perfected. Refined and mature, Apples best work
Bought it very first day from At&t store i didn't see much change from iPhone 4s every thing same except screen even most apps are not showing in full screen including apple store app. Battery is getting over very fast than 4s. Maps are no so good. For those who is upgrading form 4S it's not worth.
Best thing about this phone is lte other than that its the same phone as my iphone 4s. Dissapointed because the backing on my phone is scratched and u can see the aluminum under the black gloss..i dont like using cases i feel that defeats the purpose of the thinness. Nothing has really changed except for maps and sceen is longer not bigger but longer. I compared features to the galaxy s3 and to be honest im kind of envious of what it can do. Oh well maybe ill sell and go back to my iphone 4s and wait for galaxy s4
I have many good words to describe this phone: its Simple, elegant, responsive, reliable, well made, FAST!, durable, smooth, impressive, to my opinion this is the best phone you can buy. I love it :)
Simply the best phone on the market. iPhone has no competition -- unless you count cheap knock-offs as competition. No other phone manufacturer is engaged in active innovation. If you want the best, get this phone.
I had an iPhone 4 before this, this phone blows it out of the water in terms of size, screen resolution, speed, weight, it's all great. The battery is reasonable when in normal use but drains when playing anything graphic intensive but that goes for any phone. Apple will always prevail in this market. As a side note, didn't realize how useful Siri would be!
So far there is a lot to like with few exceptions.
In general this iPhone is as good as any other iPhone but with a couple improvements that should've been done a year or two ago. I've have had every iPhone, and finally they put in a bigger screen but not big enough compared to other phones out their, another thing is apple should really think about increasing the battery life. 4 inch screen is not going to cut it. Come on apple add features that other phones don't have, give us something that we can have that android doesn't.
The iPhone 5 is a great phone if you want an easy-to-use/ do-it-all type of device. Overall a great phone. This phone is also very fast compared to the previous generations of iPhones. I tested the speed over LTE and got just over 29 Mbps download speed. If AT&T did not have a cap on the data, I would get rid of my broadband at home. I love the size and weight of the unit as well.
The iPhone 5 is a great phone for anyone that needs to effectively use the latest technology in a simple and easy to learn device. While the rants will tell you that others are innovating well beyond Apple, I suggest that the iPhone provides the vast majority of users with exactly what they really "need" vs. catering to the wants of the uber technology geek. I want a phone that easy to use, that I can't easily break through configurations and has a large app base that will suite all my personal/professional needs. The iPhone meets these needs and goes well beyond.
When I first got the phone, the camera wouldn't open. So I took it to the store and they reset it for me. But since then it has been just as glitchy and the apps do not function all the time.
love the iphone 5 cause I already know how to use it and I can do lots of things no it like go on the internet, and post pics and check my mail
Overall the iPhone continues to be powerful phone. Apple has once again perfected the iPhone
Got the Iphone5. Complaint.....None of my Bluetooth devices work. That Sucks
I pre - ordered the phone and was happy to wait for it so I could see the first reviews. I have read some negative things but considering that over 5 million phones were sold it is not unreasonable to anticipate a few phones with problems. I asked about the return policy and held on to my iPhone4s for safety measures. Since I could return the phone I decided to buy it. I have an iPad 3 and a MAC BOOK PRO so I want to keep everything APPLE. I love the phone. It has exceeded my expectations so far. I am very impressed with the battery life as well of how fast the battery charges. The sound quality is excellent. So far I have had no problems with the phone. I have a USB outlet in my car and the IPOD function works great. It displays the entire menu on the GPS Navigation Screen and allows me to use the touch screen to change songs, etc There have been no problems with light leaks, screen bubbles, excessive data usage, purple in photos, etc. The display quality is excellent and I love the longer screen. It makes a big difference in Facebook, etc. It is very lightweight which is easy to get used to. I think I made a great choice and if any problems creeps up I will add to this post but very happy so far. I think you will have no regrets buying the phone.
Great buy! iPhone 5 has exceeded my expectations!!
Apple makes products that are easy to use! This phone is the latest example of great design, inside and out!
Siri is great improvement over the iPhone 4, use her daily. still, Google is a necessity. like the voice texting very much also.
Wow. It has a LOT of "failed calls" I can hardly use it at home. I have installed an AT&T micro-cell in the house because signal strength was SO POOR. Now also 50% of the calls result in: "Call Failed". And they discontinued the "contacts" icon on the home screen. Why? And all of my contacts DID NOT transfer over from my iPhone 4. I discover this periodically when a contact I'm looking for isn't there.
This is an excellent phone. I do like the compact size, however, my hands are larger than normal and it would be nice if there was a slightly large model.
I waited a long time to buy my first Smartphone, and I am glad I waited for the iPhone5. Easy to use, and it takes great pictures and video. I simply love it!
This is my first iphone (shocker). I wish it did more things like my blackberry (easier to manage my email, calendar, etc with my blackberry). Overall I like that I have all my music, the phone quality is good, battery life good, and the apps are very good and useful. The larger screen size is nice. The camera is OK, the zoom not much better than my friends iphone 4 and 4S. It is very fast and its easy to navigate the web (I downloaded google app).
Great investment if you utilize all the features. Apple develops products designed for everyday use. Have fun.
Great size. FAST! Sharp desktop and picture. If you don't have an iPhone, get one!
Love it, lighter, faster, bigger better screen. I waited for the 5 since the 4S was released and worth the wait.
Great iphone, picture quality is excellent, razor thin, Overall I think is the best iphone yet!
I held off last year in replacing my iPhone 3GS in favor of hoping for the iPhone to have 4G LTE capabilities. While AT&T has still not rolled this out to my area, I cannot fault the phone or the manufacturer. The phone does work great on LTE in MD, where I spend most of my day anyway. Camera is great on the phone, althoug I stil prefer to use my Sony digital camera. This is an iPhone folks, so there isn't much to be desired if you are not a fan of Apple products, but luckily I am.
I'm happy with this purchase, and I would recommend this phone to anybody.
If you are due for an upgrade this phone is worth it. Makes the amazing iPhone 4 seem small and clunky. Now the mic and speaker reach naturally between mouth and ear and the new head set rocks.
The slate colored metal is too soft and gets scratched very fast. Small click on side of phone make a mark on it. May be Jonathan needs to see this before saying that iPhone 5 does not need cover.
Upgraded from the iPhone 4 to the 5 and its definitely a phone I'd recommend. The LTE speeds are fantastic, the new processor is super smooth, and the larger screen is the perfect size for a phone.
I've had an IPhone 3GS and 4S and the iPhone 5 blows them out of the water with speed and smoothness.
I've gradually worked up from the iPhone 3G to the 4S and now the 5 with an android in the middle. I must say this is the best iPhone yet in my opinion. It's crisp, beautiful, and works flawlessly without any hiccups. I tried to go away from the iPhone in the past, but everything else just seemed cheaply made compared to the iPhone. What really has sold me though is the fact the phone doesn't stall or slow down, it's seamless. Reception and call quality is excellent and the size is great and it's very easy to work with one hand. A nice surprise so far has been battery life. I constantly text, email, use apps, and talk during the workday for my job and I make it through the day with 20-25% battery life minimum at 11 p.m. Haven't had that luxury since my old Blackberry... Needless to say i'm happy with the phone. It works perfect for my job, which I rely heavily on my phone for, and it offers plenty as far as entertainment goes for after hours.
I probably would have gone for the 4S if I had known better - better price and can do all that this does.
Like all iphones they are easy to use .THe design is just better. you can use one hand to get to all the buttons.
Having the 4S, I wasn't sure if this phone would be worth getting, but it absolutely was. It is surprisingly light and thin. I'm not sure how they were able to keep the battery life as good as the last phone, make it almost twice as fast, and make it so small. The reality is, I was satisfied with my last phone, the screen size, the speed, the overall size of the phone were all amazing. But Apple made of those even better. I thought making the screen bigger would make the phone bigger than I would like, but the way they utilized more of the bezel, instead of just making the phone taller, made it just right. The only place I get extremely irritated is the price point for the size. Apple used to increase the size for price point (8 gigs became 16 gigs for the same price and so on), but the last 2 or 3 years, they have kept it he same. There is no reason to charge another $100 for 32 gigs, or an extra $200 for 64 gigs. They are ripping us off for the space, but otherwise the iPhone 5 is amazing.
A small fringe on the aluminum back..sometime I can see pixelated lines on the keyboard.
I just got the camera days before we went on vacation to the Grand Canyon. Becuase the camera on the phone is 7.1 megapixels, I used it for the whole trip. Never picked up my old Canon camera once. It was also great for driving directions and locating sites or places to eat while we traveled. Its great fun to own - I did buy a cover for it - a must have!
I've had the iPhone for years now. I sometimes think of changing to an Android phone but when I compare, I keep coming back to the iPhone. I like the size for my small hands. It is easy to navigate apps. Texting is a breeze. Just a cool phone. If you want a phone that is reliable, has a bright, crisp screen, fast app loading, excellent camera, excellent video camera, excellent gaming.......then the iphone 5 is for you. The only downer to this phone is the battery life. It seems to be worse than my 4S iphone. But, that is a small complaint to me. I can bring my backup charger if I need to recharge it. Not a big deal. Great all around smartphone!
This is my 5th iPhone (2, 3g, 4, 4s) and it's easily the best. The larger screen is very welcome. The build quality is great, it's amazing how light the phone feels and yet very sturdy. It does not feel cheap like many of the Android phones I looked at. Very satisfied with the upgrade to this phone
Love the phone and application, hate the battery life.
I wish I had saved the money. I am still out the cost waiting on a replacement phone. Had to reactivate old phone. Apple dropped the ball on this rollout. No adapters or car chargers...
I like how they made the phone bigger and ligher but the battery life is really bad. Im also mad that they changed the charger didnt even come out with a car charger. Thankfully i have a natgation system in my jeep with a usb connecter so i could charge it but they suckered me into having to buy another chargee for $30.
I use to have a Droid, but decided to try Iphone 5. This phone is awesome. All my life, I've been fighting the power against all Apple products. I have never owned an Apple product before. This slick design is comfortable to use and perfect fit. All the other manufacturers, for some reason, think bigger is better. I hate having a mid-sized tablet upside my head. Looks stupid and feels stupid. This is a phone, people. If you want bigger, by a tablet or a laptop.
Great iPhone! I upgraded from the iPhone 4 and the speed difference is astronomical, as well as data speeds with the new LTE capability. Battery life is impressive for such a capable device. Much better than android offerings, and it charges extremely quickly. Best iPhone yet!
It's that time of the year again when Apple releases another masterpiece of a phone. I expect nothing but the best when I purchase a Apple product and again they delivered beautiful masterpiece . This iPhone 5 is the best cell phone money can buy. Not only is it a phone, it's also camera/video, GPS navigator , computer, music player/jukebox, video games, library , etc... And every feature I mentioned is rated top of the line. Apple has the best Eco system as all their products interact with each other through ICloud . You can be rest assured when you purchase a Apple product that you are getting top of the line hardware,software, and stands behind their products 100% and has the best customer service.
I have been wavering back and forth for tha last year between Iphone and Adroid. I have been wanting a larger screen. So, I had decided to jump ship frome ATT to Verizon for their 4g LTE network. I settled on the Galaxy S3 because of all the raving reviews. Lets just say the screen, while large to my taste, was a pentile display that had pixilation! Also, I couldn't just snap a shot and text it like on an iphone. It told me the picure was too large and then when I could send them Samsung sends and receives pictures as slide shows for texting! So, I returned it to check out the Iphone 5. The screen on it is slightly larger than the Iphone 4 and it is razor sharp! Iphones more or less just work like they are supposed to, so that is nice. With adroid phones you always need to download apps to get them to work to your liking ( like visual voice mail! it's just part of iphone's DNA , but if you switch to an android phone the phone company wants to charge $2.99 a month! So I had to download Google Voice and jump through hoops to get it to work for Verizon # . An issue I had with my Iphone is that it won't stay connected to my home wifi. It is supposed to remember your wifi's info but doesn't. I had to carefully watch to see if it was connected. I had to keep rentering the password for my wifi a couple of times a day. This can reek havok on the data plan! Also the build quality on the 5 vs the 4 is subpar , but still very nice. The battery charges within an hour and lasts a day and a half! Amazing! I missed Google maps and Youtube being part of the phone. Now they are things you sign into and it just aren't the same! Oh yea, Suri is ok, but for a simple task of voice dialing from the bluetooth headseat it was laggy and would not give me the correct name of the person I was trying to dial. But, tell her to set an alarm tomorrow morning and she's all over it! Well, needless to say I returned the Iphone 5 for reasons discussed here. I am back on the fence.. I may go back to the Iphone 5 if I know that the wifi issue is fixed. If I find an Android phone with a high resoulution non-pentile large screen I may get that. # Right now I am using an HTC Rezound that has a high resolution screen .. no pixilation like on the Galaxy S3, but it is not HD and the body of the phone is huge, so it is getting me by until I decide what to do next. ) I hope this helps give you a sense of what to choose.
Apple has done it again. Iphone5 is excellent. Fast thin and sleek. Some people complain about the side of the phone getting scratched. Well if you have coins and keys in your pockets what do you expect. Get a case to protect your phone.
Between all the Android phones and iPhones to chose from today it's tough to argue which is the best phone to suite your daily needs. The biggest problem with Android and Apple phones? The fanboys. So like many, I was considering Apple's iPhone 4S and Samsung's Galaxy SIII. However, the iPhone 5 has the 4G LTE data speeds available which take my word for it, is stupid fast. Arguably faster than most people's home Wi-Fi speeds. This alone replaced the iPhone 4S on my list with the iPhone 5. Samsung's Galaxy SIII and Apple iPhone's are probably the two most popular phones on the market today. As with computers (after all these are just small computers) the market cost are tight and by that I mean that manufacturing cost for similar models in respect to performance doesn't vary a considerable amount because the hardware components inside are comparable. So the real battle here was deciding between the operating systems. If you've never used a smartphone Apple's iPhone is by far the most user friendly. If you've already adapted to one of the two operating systems then it won't be fun switching to the other operating system and learning how to effectively use it (part of the reason for the fanboys). Short and to the point more stuff is free in Google's Playstore which can be both good and bad. Quality over quantity if your buying a $1000+ (after two years) toy. Android is also more interactive with the file types on your computer for example its easier to edit word and excel documents on an android phone with the Polaris office application (apple has there own apps for office editing software but cost a little more). Apples iPhone is great with everyday use (i.e. games, news, weather, etc) if you don't need to edit office files on the go the or load emulated games to your phone then either is a good choice. Jailbreaking or rooting is always there if you're not pleased with either operating system. But more on the 4S vs the 5. Lets be honest the only considerable differences between the iPhone 4S and the iPhone 5 is: weight, thickness, screen size, 1080p resolution, camera quality, processor speed (which effects every functions' or applications speed), and LTE is now available. You know... actually that list is considerably large for the $100 difference in the iPhone 4S and the iPhone 5. The new 4 inch screen to my surprise really isn't as encumbering as I expected. In the end I went with the iPhone 5 it really is an improvement from the 3GS an 4 speed wise and beats the 4S in weight and cellular data speed. For real 4G LTE is extremely fast for most applications and isn't available on the SIII.
Like the light weight. Screen is not wide enough. Camera doesn't work at all. It is fast,but aren't they all when they're new?
I don't usually don't write reviews, but this phone deserves one. I upgraded from the iPhone 4 and don't regret it a bit! I've used android phones also, but this is the best phone I've had yet. It's new processor makes it run like silk. Very smooth performance. The screen size is perfect. I can see why they opted to keep the width the same...it fits your hand perfectly. I won't go on about the technical specs. All you need to know is that this is a quality phone. You won't regret upgrading either.
I've played around with other phones and none are as good as the iPhone, both from a functionality perspective and aesthetically. There's a reason Apple has the #1 selling phone in the world - it's because they do it best!
I must start out with those who give the iPhone 5 a low rating must either not realize how far along they have come and the true enhancements that make the iPhone 5 the best selling smartphone at this time. Not only is the phone thinner and have a larger screen, but add in the lightness, upgraded flash, camera, CPU, and RAM - it truly is a great smartphone to own. I'm glad I upgraded from my iPhone 4S!!!...
I picked my phone up around midnight. I upgraded from an iphone 4. I like the phone, don't get me wrong, but the iPhone 5 is like the same thing almost. The screen is a little bigger. I am surprised the screen isn't bigger than 4 inches! Most of the modern smartphones have screens bigger than that. I am happy that there is 4g with this phone. But almost everything else is identical to my old phone. Apple needs to step up. They sued Samsung because they knew that they couldn't make a better product than them. Since I got this phone with the upgrade deal, I probably will sell it online to some other iSheep fan for a bunch of money. Samsung Galaxy S3 son... Samsung Galaxy S3!
Upgraded from iphone 4 to the 5 and with the larger screen and Siri capability, I am really enjoying the new hardware. My complaints are the same as every other iphone Apple has released: the battery. If you want great battery life, turn off every bell and whistle the phone has to offer, which defeats the purpose of having the features in my opinion. If Apple would just truthfully, say, "It's an iphone, your battery is gonna suck, get used to it" instead of making untrue promises in regards to the battery, I would have more faith in their marketing claims.
I love this phone. I've had the 3GS and the 4. This is such a vast improvement over previous models. iOS 6 is fantastic. It is fast and responsive. The processor is incredible. My flight simulator apps run smoothly and open quickly.
I have grandfathered unlimited data and a number of paid productivity apps, so I'm pretty much locked in to the AT&T iPhone until they take my unlimited data away. As usual with Apple, the device is beautiful, but it has to go in a case, or it won't stay that way for long. When they made the screen longer, they should have reoriented some things like the favorites screen to the bottom for one-handed use, or at least have given that as an option. Battery life is unpredictable and overall mediocre. I still love my iPhone, and would recommend that anybody look at it as an option, but if I were a first-time buyer with complete freedom, I might very well buy something different. I would recommend the iPhone for a person who is not tech oriented and who wants a great device that just works without having to understand anything under the hood.
Can't complain about it yet, faster processor, 4g capability, but I do wish battery life wasn't so short.
I AM VERY PLEASED WITH THE VOICE ACTIVATION FEATURES AND THE RAPID SEARCH
i like my new phone compared to my previous 4S since it's lighter and thin. It's quite fast when i surf the net. Battery is ok since it gives me about 2-3 days depending on my usage.
Great Phone to high price. Best camera they have out so far.
iPhones rock! Best by far!!! Siri kicks [butt] !!!
I had the I phone 4 previous to this I phone 5. The new I phone 5 in my opinion is a leap forward in technology in every aspect. The browsing speed is improved. The responsiveness is improved. The call clarity is improved. The screen is improved and a little bigger. It is better in every way than the previous generation I Phone
The iphone5 is a definate improvement over the iPhone 4S One of the best features of the new phone is the LTE capability and along with the faster processor speed, there is a much improved Internet speed. The LTE also pulls in signals that the 4g on the iphone4s was not able to get. I take a train from Chicago suburbs to the downtown area every day and the improved range is very much improved. Looking forward to the iPhone 6!!
I have had an iPhone 3 and 4 and the 5 is by far the best iPhone to date. The LTE is faster then my wifi at home and the bigger processor chip makes a HUGE difference!! Apps load instantly and no screen lag at all when moving from screen to screen. The layout is better and the updated phone settings to ignore calls is great. The e-mail app has also been updated and works much better......I even have no issue with the map program....If you want to get from A to B....it works fine in my opinion. The iPhone 5 is the benchmark smartphone that all others stride for but fall short.
Very good phone. Easy to use. I would recommend this phone to anyone.
I have been using the iPhone since the first one came out and as usual, I picked up this phone the day it came out. Don't get me wrong, this thing is a beauty - simple and elegant and will do all the things that you would expect from an iPhone. But I am really disappointed by the quality of pictures that this phone takes. The purple tint that the pictures have when you take a picture with any source of light in the corners is really unacceptable. Since the iPhone 4, I had been using the iPhone as a replacement to my point and shoot and this problem with the 5 is a dealbreaker for me. And battery life while on LTE sucks. So if you take a lot of pictures like me you have two options, go back and use the older iPhone 4s (which has a great camera) or you could just switch to a more powerful Galaxy s3. Your choice.
Really like the phone. the reception has improved from the previous iPhone.
iPhone 4S owners may not notice anything more special about the 5, but upgrading from the iPhone 3, like me, makes a significant difference. So far, this is a happy, repeat customer!
Overall, another great product from Apple. There have been some minor complaints about the Maps app, but I personally think they're overblown. If you want a fast, reliable piece of equipment, it doesn't get any better than the iPhone 5.
I've had three iPhones--the 5 is the worst for the Internet. If you don't mind dial-up speeds or Internet non-connections, it is great as an iPod. The 4LTE exists only in a few small areas of the Minneapolis metro area; that's ATT's fault. At home, the wifi speed is much slower than my old 3GS or my wife's 4. That's an Apple fault that may be fixed in the future, but just read the forums before you buy. Well, I just had to have it, so my bad.
This phone improved on all the right stuff Better Call quality Bigger screen while still being able to hold with one hand great battery life despite the lte antenna better color saturation in the screen Still has the best digital media player of any smart phone on the market moved all the ports on the bottom.
Very nice phone, 4g speeds are very fast , battery life is good ,4in screen is perfect for the iPhone and the design is amazing ....overall it's the best iPhone
I ran out of space on my 32gb iphone 4s just as the iphone 5 was about to be released. I am a heavy apps user, heavy texter and heavy picture-taker. This phone is so much more faster than the 4s and has so much more space. I love it. I hate that the charger was changed because now I have to buy a new set of chargers for my car and home.
Excellent and is highly recommended . Very useful and excellent features.
The best phone and handheld there is. Sansung tries hard, but this is hard to beat.
All they did was make the best phone ever even better.
perfect phone for everyone. Easy to use, great battery life, and it just works.
I've been an IPhone fan since it has come out, so I might be a little biased, I love this phone. It's sleek, has great features and in my opinion, the best IPhone yet!
This iPhone 5 is horrible overall has a large amount of drop calls & battery life is horrible... I should have kept my 4S it was much better
Great phone and easy to use and transition was seamless. Camera is much faster and processor is really fast.
Overall satisfied. It is my first Iphone so I have little to compare it to. I like it much better than my Blackberry.
The Apple iPhone X factor is ending??...no longer being wowed when comparing the market and functionality of other phones with the price paid. If your current iPhone suffices, I do not recommend upgrading to the iPhone 5--wait, wait, wait.
Love love love. iPhone 5 is fast, the panoramic picture is very cool and easy to use. The battery life is disappointing and I look forward to the adapter being released so I can use it with my iHome. Love the new ear buds.
I had the iPhone 3G and then the iPhone 4. The iPhone 5 is my least favorite among them. The bottom of the screen flickers for a second about twice a month, suggesting there's a loose connection in there some where. Between this and a 4S, you might just want to save your money. These are more heavy duty than the Samsung SIII, but if my contract wasn't up, I probably would have elected to keep my 4.
I have allways had android phones in the past. I LOVE the iphone 5!! I will never go back to a android phone. The iphone is set up better, less confusing to use & the apps are way better..they all work. not the case with an android phone.
I use my iPhone 5 for everything!! It's a miracle of science. I've had iPhones ever since they first came out and I'm constantly in awe over its functionality and size. My laptop is getting dusty.
Real upgrade from the iPhone 4. Longer battery life.
I had a 4 and thought I couldn't do better but 5 is definitely better
Overall ok good betters life charges too fast use to With and android takes little time to use iphone
Overall it's a great iPhone. Love Siri. Great phone.
I really love this phone like never see before thanks guys
Love my iPhone 5 apple does it again! Perfect size phone
Since I have had the phone I haven't had any disappointments yet.
Having had earlier iPhones and an Android phone, the iPhone 5 is- in my opinion- the finest smartphone in the USA today. I am very pleased that Apple has included so many radios in the phone, making it basically global ready and very fast when exchanging information over the Internet. Call quality is a big improvement over the iPhone 4 and the iPhone 3GS (I've had both). The design is simply stunning; you need to see it in person to appreciate it. Cons: The battery life on this phone has not quite met my expectations, the iPhone 4 I had performed slightly better. What's more, I have not used the phone over LTE, so I expect that when I do use LTE, the battery will drop more quickly. I think Apple should release a minor refresh of iOS 6 to address battery life, and I expect they will (kind of like iOS 5). Maps is a fine app, it has received a great deal of hostility that I think is overblown. It is not yet up to Google Maps in terms of refinement, but it is certainly VERY GOOD for being the initial public release of the app. My only other con is one I have had for a long time with the iPhone... there is no other keyboard solution. I would like to see a T9 variant, especially because I have large fingers and it is difficult to reliably hit certain characters on the QWERTY keyboard. Overall: Despite the slight negatives associated with this phone, I would HIGHLY recommend this over an Android phone such as the Galaxy S III. I know several people with that phone and it is slower than the iPhone 5 in everyday use, it has a screen with inferior quality (not specs, just look at the two side-by-side), and the SGSIII is just huge and goofy looking. It is like putting an oven mitt to the side of your face. If you think that is cool, go for it. If you get the iPhone 5, you will definitely enjoy it.
I love this phone. Not too crazy about iTunes and all the proprietary limits but this new iPhone 5 really packs a punch in speed, weight, and ease of use. Had to move up from the iPhone 4 and I really notice a difference in performance. Battery life could be better and I'm not all to happy they decided to switch charge ports on the consumer so try can get more money but that's life. If we want it, then we buy it
Originally posted this review (erroneously) under the Verizon model. I've had Blackberrys for years, but when I bought an iPad earlier this year, and switched to Mac (which my company uses and I purchased one of my own), I was frustrated by the awkwardness of integrating the BB email, etc., with my Apple products. I decided to switch, and to wait for the latest version of iPhone. So far, I am VERY happy with it. It is pleasant to hold in your hand, alone or with a case. I've heard many complaints about "scuffs" and so forth, but my phone was perfect out of the box. Best of all, it plays nicely with my other Apple devices, and my email life (one of my main reasons for having a smartphone to begin with) is now simple. I have to carry an Android (Bionic) for work, and I like the Apple iOS much better. Having already learned to use the iPad, the learning curve was not too steep. I like being able to switch back and forth between the devices at will, without having to mentally switch gears as to what I am using. Apple's tendency to sometimes over-"simplify" things can sometimes be annoying, but overall this is a fantastic phone for my purposes. Glad I was able to get my hands on one so quickly--just dumb luck that a store within driving distance happened to have the one I wanted in stock. I've been with AT&T for years, and like their customer service and coverage. The 32GB size seems "just right."
First off, let me say - to all the people saying this is a minor bump versus the 4S; Do your homework. This has been ranked the FASTEST smartphone in the WORLD by PC Magazine (http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2410034,00.asp), it was ranked the best display out of all smartphones (http://www.macrumors.com/2012/09/24/displaymate-rates-iphone-5-screen-as-best-smartphone-display-theyve-seen/) as well as best camera by Consumer Reports, more recently. A little background about myself - I'm pretty technical. I started off with Blackberry and I've had every iPhone starting with the 3G and afterwards. Before this phone came out, I had contemplated giving Android a try, but in the end I'm happy with my decision to stay with iPhone. Versus the 4S, this phone is lightning fast (mind you AT&T had 4G on the 4S which is actually what pushed me to upgrade then), but this new LTE is seriously at least 3X faster. The phone also received an upgraded TRIPLE-CORE graphics chip and it runs dual dual-core processors and features bursting (or as we'll call it "safe overclocking"). Even with all of these upgrades, the battery life is phenomenal. My 4S would have thrown in the towel and pretty much flashed that "plug me in" screen as I call it by the time I got home. My 5 is at 32% after a full day's use! Craziness. The lightning adapter is amazing as well - it seems like my phone charges up in about 30 minutes or so. This needs to make its way to iPad pronto! I love that the cable can be inserted either way as well - a small, but still nice convenience. The headphone jack on the bottom is another small, but welcome change. I had an iPod touch so I always thought it was weird to have the headphones on the bottom of the iPod and the top of the iPhone, although you get used to it over time. I'm not really a camera person, but the panoramic is AWESOME and very easy to use. You can tell a difference in clarity between the 4S and 5's optics as well. I love how much lighter the 5 is compared to the 4/4S and I'll tell you - Apple really disappointed case/screen shield manufacturer's with this one, because the phone is just so beautiful every other one I see is completely naked and oddly enough; White is the new black; everyone used to carry the black iPhone and I've never seen so many white iPhones before! Before purchasing I had played around with some Android phones - namely the Droid Razor Maxx (due to battery) and the S3 (due to hype) but in the end, I'm glad I stuck with iPhone. It's the perfect size, perfect weight, and from all the rave reviews it really seems like Apple delivered and made it worth the weight - and an added bonus is I didn't have to re-buy all my apps (jumping to Android you would). I will warn you, in most cell phone stores they usually drive customers away from iPhones because the stores don't make money on them. They make a killing on Android phones (and they're usually commissioned in one way or another - don't be fooled - both AT&T and Verizon stores have been caught doing this). At the end of the day, buy what suits you best because you have to use it but you definitely won't be disappointed here!
I've owned a lot of phones over the years. Motorola razor, nokias, sony erricksons, and even 2 previous iphones, most recently the 3gs and from the moment you pick up this phone you can tell the bar has been raised. The quality of this, I would liken to stepping into a luxury sedan. There is such a tight tolerance now on these devices they feel like a mini stealth jet or something. I owned my 3gs for nearly 4 years and the only reason I upgraded was because the number of apps and info I keep on my phone had basically slowed it down and filled it up completely but I would recommend this phone to anyone and everyone.
Ok, so by philosophy I am a Droid guy. Apples makes me extremely angry with all of their Apple BS (no flash, can't use phone as a Thumb Drive, don't own music you've paid for, etc. etc. etc.). In fact, I really wanted to buy the Samsung SIII. HOWEVER, seriously, who wants to carry around a wallet sized phone in their pocket? At some point in the future, people are going to look back and laugh at the size of phones today... kind of like how we laugh now at 80s hair.. ya know, the bigger the cooler! I needed a PHONE that had access to the internet, maps, could entertain me when bored, and takes beautiful pictures. Minus my hated for Itunes, the Iphone 5 is perfect. I don't even notice it in my pocket. It is super-fast, even on Sprint's 3G Network (in Philly and waiting on 4gLTE). I don't have any light leaks. The maps works fine (used it three different times thus far and no issues). the back of the phone doesn't scratch even when I have my keys, coins, whatever nonsense people are complaining about. Listen, as with previous releases, Apple fan-boys are hard to please because they are cry-babies that gain self-confidence by the stupid Apple logo carried on their devices. As for me hating Apple software, I will jailbreak the phone and unleash its full potential and then it will be perfect. However, even if I didn't jailbreak, I don't regret 1 bit choosing this over bigger sized competitors. I was sitting next to a women today at a soccer game. She was on her S3. I actually laughed outloud at how comically large that phone is.
Very disappointing. I think Apple released this a little too early. The maps directions have to be the worst. Images are blurred, can not find location, routes are way out of the way. Im also experiencing troubles connecting to WiFi at home, work etc. I connect and then drops, very frustrating. The other thing that upset me is there are two places if I tilt the phone I can see light escaping around the edges. It looks like the glass is not completely set to the base. My battery dies about 3/4 thru my day so I have to plug it in at work where I never had to do that with my 4s. Earphones sound great but they hurt my ears after about 2 or 3 hours. I would rather keep my 4s and wait.
I upgraded to the iPhone 5 from the iPhone 4, and let me say, HUGE DIFFERENCE. The speed is noticeably faster, the phone is extremely light, and Siri is so much fun! The camera is significantly better than the iPhone 4's. Although there have been some bugs with the new maps, I'm sure Apple will fix it. Turn by turn directions are great, and the design of maps is really pleasing to the eye. The iPhone 5 may have disappointed people in the fact that it did not have some great new thing, but it is a solid hardware update. So, if you are looking for an easy to use, beautiful, luxurious, and extremely fast phone, look no further! The iPhone 5 is for you!
I upgraded to this phone from an iphone 4 and glad i did. everything is better about it. very fast, nice screen and the camera is very good. i showed it off to co workers and family and they all want one.
This really is a great phone. It's amazingly fast. I did a download test with LTE, and it downloads data at 50MB/sec, and uploads at around 30MB/sec. (Of course that can change a lot based on signal strength, network traffic, etc) The camera quality is excellent, even in low light. Panoramic mode is really great too. The screen is a great size, can still use the phone easily with one hand. The only thing that is not too great is the map app, especially in satellite mode. But it's new, I am sure Apple will improve it.
I've been getting every iphone since they first came out, and it just keeps getting better and better, bigger screen, faster, enhanced in every way. The picture quality is excelent. Very light and thin. Awesome phone!
made my life, as simple as it gets amazing how no one thought of it before !!!
My husband's Lifeproof case ended up leaking. A quick call to Lifeproof and the case was replaced! I wrote Lifeproof a letter and requested that they make teal color too for personal reasons and they are coming out with one soon!!! Kudos to Lifeproof and thank you very much!!!!
This is absolutely the best looking case ever! I get compliments on it every day, it's very light, but sturdy, and has a great feel.
Limited Edition. I love how it feels. Who doesn't love chewy
As an apple representative I have tried out many iPhone cases, ranging from the bumpers, to the lifeproof, and the one that I feel provides the best protection is the otterbox. Now I may get criticism on saying the lifeproof isnt as protective but from a 3 foot fall the lifeproof didn't hold up. Although the defender isn't waterproof, manly every color matches a white or black iPhone 4/4s. I highly recommend it and hope you choose the otterbox!
Gender and age specific, bought as a gift for my teen aged daughter.
I luv the versatility of the product. I really luv the design of Hello Kitty. It really does its job of preventing the iPhone screen from any scratches and dust.
I bought this just for a quick replacement case to get me by for a little. It has a really nice look to it with the blue Hurley logo on the back, but after a months use of in and out of pocket that blue is beginning to fade. Case cracks very easy, barely tapped it against a hard surface and it failed.
i wish the price for iphone was $85.00 dollars its much more better if it white color it does not matter i can buy harry potter skin cover the black
The shield lowers the resolution of the HD quality screen by more than half. It looks like a film of technicolor static/glitter covering your screen.
Impossible to apply. Does not cover the whole screen. Is not fully anti-glare in the same sense as most other anti-glare covers. Only comes with 1 cover. You get 1 strike and you are out.
as far as covers go its a good one. i've not had any bubbles, or discoloration on the cover itself as of yet and it does keep the screen easily readable. fairly heavy phone user so as long as it stands up i wont need to update this review
My wife says the clarity is affected slightly but offers protection when our kids are handling the iPhone. Worth it for us. Very happy with the outcome.
Excellent cover. No smudges, no glare. Love it. Would definitely buy again for next iphone.
I can't tell you how difficult this item is to apply to the 4s. First of all, it didn't even fit my phone, it was smaller than the phone. You have to spray your fingers and the protector with the included solution. After trying to line it up several times, a small piece of black lint stuck to and would not come off. For the price, you should get more than one protector. And here's an idea. Maybe have the peel off backing on both sides with a tab to peel it off after you apply it. Then you don't have to wet your fingers and try to high five the phone to apply it.
I loved my Zagg cover! It definately feels thicker and of higher quality than most screen protectors I've had in the past. Unfortunately mine prevented my proximity sensor from functioning. I had to choose to either cut a hole in my $25.00 screen protector, or remove it all together; definately a let down. Because of this, I'm unsure of recommending it to others.
This product is very expensive for only one screen protector, once you remove it you might as well throw it away. They claim they will replace them for life...I went to the site to get a replacement and they wanted 3.99 to shipping plus to put a hold on my credut card for the full retail value of the replacement (which they claimed was 25.00). If I did not send back my old zagg (at my own cost for mailing) within 7 days they would charge my credit card. Stay away!
This screen protector is great. Completely smudge proof, any indents and scratches smooth out after a few seconds & is very easy to put on your phone yourself I just wish there was one for the back of the phone as well.
The phone protector works well, I just wish I didn't notice it was there.
This is worth the $. Leaves no streaks and less glare in sun. Best Buy guy put it on after I bought my Iphone 4s. It has a lifetime warranty. Worth it!
I am happy with this item. I had purchased it when I had got a less sufficient case. In the time since (45 day), I upgraded my case to an OtterBox Defender but kept the scree protector for the additional safety. Very Satisfied.
I'm very pleased with product. It does as advertised. Doesn't work well the otterbox comuter case. Case causes shield to peel back around edges.
Smudge free -- not so much. It is also hard to see the phone in sunlight. However it does protect my screen superbly. The next question is would I recommend it... Maybe... But, I would warn people about how hard it is to see the phone in sunlight. I plan to try and find a protector that works and is easy to see through in sunlight. Hey... Best Buy... You need a maybe button. I don't want to commit to yes or no for recommending this to a friend... I might recommend this. You are only offering strong yes or strong no. I am neither. You need to get a maybe button!
I have always used a Zagg shield for my iPhones but the new smudge free finish is the BEST!
the screen protector does as promised....no glare in the sun.
My wife had one of these on her last Iphone and when she upgraded, she wanted one on her new phone. It was very easy to install and provides the best protection for any sheild on the market.
Keeps my IPhone protected and it is easy to clean and keep the phone looking good.
Doesnt peel and is a good product for the price. The employee at best buy installed it for me and he did a great job I have had my phone for a month now
This is a great cover! It's smudge resistant which is my number one reason for buying it, and I love the anti-glare feature! I was skeptical that it wouldn't be as effective as the salesman told it would be, but he was absolutely correct!!
I have been using screen protectors for as long as I have had a smartphone. I started using Zagg Products when I has my first Gen iPhone. Recently getting the iphone 4s I was using a screen protector I got from the supplier. Until recently when it was scratched and I had to take it off and throw it away. Anyway this screen protector does what is advertises. It is smudge free and it does protect the screen. Putting it on can be a hassle. However, I just let the Best Buy person out it on for me. That way if it gets messed up within 30 days I can take it back to them and they can fix it. As for the screen. I have noticed that there is some grainyness or issues with the clarity of the retina display on the iphone. I have seen many complaints about this. I can honestly say that I do see it. However it is not enough to make me want to take the screen protector off. Face it, any screen cover is going to take away from the screen. If you want to protect the device this should not be a problem. Zagg has a lifetime warranty on this product and they are easy to deal with to get it replaced.
Great screen protector, doesn't show smudges, won't scratch
Definitely worth the money for this iphone screen protector. I bought a cheaper one to begin with and it was terrible for smudges and lines. This was the 2nd screen protector I purchased and I am extremely happy with it. Does not show smudges and scratches at all. I had a few bubbles in it when I first put it on, that disappeared by the next day.
Best Buy said this was the very best shield for my new 4S. Wrong...it doesn't cover the face of the device. For the recommendation and the price it should do the basic job of covering the device.
Other reviewers are on the money--the cut-outs on these are a bit off & even missing a rectangular portion cut out toward the top. Why? It serves its function but the lack of attention to detail in the manufacturing of the product is lackluster. Meh...
It works. It works well. So did my $2 screen protector. Don't know if it's worth the extra money but I have only had it for 2 months.
Although the Smudge Free does resist smudges and not require frequent cleaning, it is all in the way it was installed and that was done in store, but not exact enough so now after two weeks there is a Bubble on the edge, that has to be swiped out every few days to avoid the entire thing from coming off, and I am NOT going back to store to pay $8 to have it fixed. Lesson Learned from other phone
I love that its anti-glare and has a matte finish. However, I do not like how it affects the display of the iPhone. When looking at lighter colored screens you can see the screen protector--it looks like hundreds of little multicolored dots, as one reviewer put it: it looks fuzzy. I'm going back and getting the shiny one; I'd much rather wipe off my fingerprints than have to look at a "fuzzy" screen.
Seems rock solid. No glare, touch screen still seems sensitive.
I was a little apprehensive about purchasing a screen protector that was $25 but I'm glad I did! This thing is awesome! I've dropped my phone a couple of times and I've not had to worry about the screen being scratched when I picked it up. It doesn't have an annoying glare either. Very easy to put on too!
I like that I don't have to wipe my phone off every two minutes with this screen protector and the glare on the screen is all but non-exsistent. I don't like that sometimes little pieces of debris (lint, dust, crumbs, etc.# get stuck wroung the edges and the home button. I've also had problems with the screen getting dirty #from daily usage) But so far its worth what I paid.
I have the Zagg Smudge free shield on my IPhone and I love it. I'm not having to wipe my screen constantly due to smudges and it doesn't effect the view.
The "anti glare" feature of this blurs the screen and makes it unacceptable to me, The Iphone has this great looking screen and it is ruined by this screen protector. Great protector but lousy view. You can get the clear and it will take care of this. Don't buy the anti glare.
I'll start by pointing out that you're purchasing a screen protector, expect your display to change slightly visually. I found the application process simple and the directions very clear as to the proper way to prep the phone and install the product. That being said, all the reviews with complaints about the installation being "difficult" are maybe coming from people who should have paid someone that knows what they're doing to install it. They give tou everything you need to install it properly other than patience, and common sense. As a chef I use my phone frequently while in the kitchen and have found the anti-smudge/glare protective screen to be irreplaceable. Now when I see other folks iPhones covered in finger smudges and scratches I immediately reccomend this product to them. A friend of mine actually cracked his screen recently and applied the Zagg shield to hold it together until he can replace it. This is one tough as hell product, and I love it.
Let the professionals install this item even if it costs you a few dollars. Like the warranty on the item so if it bubbles I can take it back.
This InvisiShield is great compared to the stock InvisiShield. I have the old shield on the iPod Touch and is always smudged and greasy. This smudge free has a nice feel that isn't slippery. I like the matte finish compared to shiny.
it is smudge proof that is a plus, but it takes away from the nice screen, makes it fuzzy
I bought 2 phones and 2 protective shields. One shield is currently peeling up. The other one was peeling back causing dirt to collect on my daughter's phone sop she peeled it off and threw it away. (She did not realize it was warrantied. )
The screen protector is well worth the money. I would hightly recommend it to anyone with a phone of any kind. It protects the screen from scratches.
I also had the employee do it. It was worth the $7.99! They GUARANTEE it. If it bubbles or pits or has a dust speck under the shield, they will do it again! I know because when I got it home, there was the TEENIEST speck of dust and the girl gladly re-did it. She even redid it a 3rd time because SHE wasn't happy with how it was lined up. I couldn't use my phone for an hour or two and they recommend not putting the case on for 24 hours. Honestly, I LIKE the non glare and smudge-proof qualities. What it takes away from the resolution isn't enough for me to give up on it being non glare. I travel a lot on planes and cars and I can't STAND the glare!!! Who cares about how amazing the resolution is if I can't see the screen to begin with. Depending on YOUR personal use, you really may not like the non glare. I think for gaming, it might not be the best but I don't do that so I don't know. I have no problem with the holes not being lined up, they are, BUT, I did wait to put the case on and I still saw a little lift on the edge where the case was perhaps pushing the edge up. It flattened right out though. I might need to just get a less bulky case which is ok with me. Good news..if that happens again...they will replace it again. FOR FREE. And the ZAGG people promise that they will replace the protector for LIFE. So really...the $26 plus $8 isn't a lot to spend in the end. How many junky screen protectors do you have to buy in your life? It adds up! If you don't like the non glare, Zagg makes the shiny one too. It's a really great product!
Pro: It has protected my iPhone from a badly designed case that otherwise would have damaged the screen. Con: It really does effect the visual quality of the screen quite a bit. I'm the only one of my iPhone clan to have one of these, and other users when they see mine make a comment along the lines of, "Oh. Eeeew. Didn't you get a Retina display? The colors are off, the resolution is low... Mine looks much better!" And, they're right: theirs do look much better.
Went on easily and looks good. Believe it will protect my screen.
This was a little pricey for me, but when the warranty was explained to me that the cover was virtually indestructible and that over time I would spend the same or more for multiple covers, I went ahead and bought this. It went on very easily and does what it claimed- no smudges or glare! I never have to wipe the phone like I had to with other covers. Great product!
What's wrong with this thing? It really affects the clarity of the display. I even took it off, cleaned & reapplied - no dice.
What a waste of money! Even with following the directions exactly, this shield did not offer a clear screen. it may protect the iPhone, but what good is it if you can't see the screen????
I spent the money and while installing found out that the protector is considerably smaller that the screen itself so it does not have the right fit. The cutouts are not lining up right. And now that it has been used, I cannot return it. I could have spent much less for a better screen but thought trusting product from BestBuy was a good idea. I was wrong
The screen cover is complete junk and is awful!!!!
I've used Zagg screen protectors in the past and they work great. I saw this one and bought 3 of them (myself, my wife and daughter). After applying it to my daughter's iPhone 4, i was very disappointed. The "filter" and/or smudge proof coating causes a strange effect on the screen resolution making it look almost pixelated or grainy. What ever benefit was gained by the retina display is lost after this. Although it is still great at protecting the screen from scratches, visually, it detracts from the high resolution of an iPhone. I am going to return the 2 unused products to Best Buy the next time I go back and purchase a standard Zagg shield.
This is the 2nd one I've used in the past year on my Iphone and it will be the last. Don't waste you time on a product that dosen't last. Better off buying the cheaper ones and replacing every few months then spending the extra money on this product that is more expensive and simply doesn't last. Both time the Besy Buy employees recommended this product, both times I bought it and both times I regretted it. Never again!
This screen protector took me several tries to get it on properly and then when I finally did get it on, it made the screen look all pixely.
although it's easy to apply, it doesn't always stay in place. i replaced it with the zagg anti-glare and had the best buy staff apply it. the zagg may be more, but in the long run, it was well worth the step up and having it applied correctly.
If you are use to the regular protect shield do not buy this one as it does take away from the retina display
It was screen protector difficult to apply and the edges bubbled up when I attempted to put a couple of different cases on
The Zagg is easier to apply than other screens I've used, is the toughest available, and has a lifetime warranty. Can't be beat.
The ZAGG sceen protector has worked as advertised. I highly recommend having a trained store employee install the protector--they use a special type of spray and there are NO bubbles once they've finished the installation. I have not noticed blurriness, nor have I noticed any smudges. Compared to my friends' phone screens with no protectors, the protector really makes a difference. It's one of those products one pays no attention to after a couple days. That's a good thing.
ZAGG makes good products and has a lifetime warranty. It does distort the picture though which was a big problem for me.
This product provides adequate screen protection, but is no where near smudge-free as the manufacturer describes.
Although this screen protector does keep smudges and scratches from ruining your phone it makes your screen look horrible. Do not purchase this unless you are willing to give up the retina display.
I had the regular one on my old iPhone, but got the Smudge Free one with my new 4S. I love it.
I got talked into (conned?) by the sales associate at a Best Buy into spending a ridiculous amount of money of a screen protector. Initially I was really unhappy; when I applied it to the phone I couldn't seem to get some bubbles out of it, and it does change the way the display actually looks. The instruction manual says that after a few days "imperfections" will work themselves out, and much to my surprise, they did! 48 hours later the thing looked perfect on my phone; the bubbles magically worked their way out, somehow. It also feels kind of cool to the touch, and it doesn't *EVER* smudge. I know that seems hard to believe, but I seriously don't ever have to wipe my phone off anymore. So here's my bottom line: if you care about glare, care about smudges (and having to clean them up), aren't bothered that the phone screen will be dimmed a little, and are willing to pay an outrageous amount of money for a protector, this thing is pretty good. If not, go with the $10 one.
I'm surprised this has such poor reviews! I think this screen protector is great. It does make the screen appear a little fuzzy at first, but I don't even notice it anymore and don't think it takes away from the HD quality. The little bit of texture doesn't bother me. If anything I think it makes the screen feel more resilient. The smudge resistance is awesome; phone doesn't get fingerprints all over the screen anymore. Definitely think this protector is worth the money.
I love this! The glare is reduced as promised, granted it takes some getting used to the somewhat grainy look. Other than that it does everything as promised, its easily installed, and is better than any other screen protector Ive ever used.
I bought a zagg cover for my 3GS a couple of years ago and it was amazing!!!! So I immediately had one put on my 4S when I bought it!!! I had to return my original 4S to apple due to defect. When I received my new one I opted out of ordering my free replacement screen protector because it was that bad!!! Zagg please go back to original style it was very protective and didn't make your screen all pixelated!! I can clean off a few finger prints!! Zagg WAS the best!!! Now I wouldn't spend one cent on their screen protector!!!!!
I've used these shields for my iTouch, iPad, and iPhone products for a long time. They have always been a favorite but the improvement of a non-smudge surface for the iPhone is fantastic! I can't wait for them to roll the shield material out for my iPad!! I would not own an iDevice without having this protecting the screen :)
I purchased this screen protector with my new Iphone. I paid $8 for Bestbuy to install it. As I was leaving I noticed the screen looked grainy, but I was in a hurry and didn't think much of it. I got it home and it looked really bad! What's the point of having a really nice screen if you are going to make it look bad with this protector. I tried to return it to bestbuy a few days later, but they told me that since it was installed I could not return it. The store manager told me to damage it and get the company to replace it with the regular clear one. So, I paid $26 for this plus $8 for them to install it. Now I am supposed to jump through hoops and pay $4 for shipping to get a screen protector that is $10 CHEAPER! For all the math majors out there! $26+$8+$4= $38 just to end up with an overpriced $15 clear screen protector. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!
First off, let me get one thing out of the way... screen protector quality depends highly on how well it goes on in the first place. This is probably my 30th screen protector installation, and it went flawlessly. Not a single bubble, not a single crease. It is rare that an installation goes so well as this one did. Because of that, I can say that it wasn't because of installation that I've had so many issues with this... 1. This screen protector was smudged/scratched with a clean paper napkin. I got a droplet of water on my screen one day so I used a semi-soft paper napkin to dry it off, resulting in a nasty scratch on this screen protector... strike one. 2. The screen protector has developed an odd orange-peel effect that is messing with the appearance of things on my screen. Not sure why this has happened... Strike two 3. From the start, this screen protector has collected smudges. Strike three on the "Smudge Proof" B.S. All in all, worst screen protector I've ever owned. This is made worse by the fact that I paid $25 for it... Unbelievable. The cheap no-name screen protector I bought from Verizon when I first got my IPhone was superior to this one. Which leads me to my next suggestion, buy a generic screen protector for $10 or less. It will most likely be better. Before I leave without giving any pros... the one thing this screen protector does well is reducing sun glare. For once, I could actually read my screen in direct sunlight! But that is quickly nullified by the numerous cons that plague this product.
This thing is great...once you've given it the three days of cure time it needs! I can't imagine how you have that kind of time to not use your phone, but it needs every minute of it. Once that is accomplished, it is quite tough and quite clear.
This screen protector is terrible. It does work good for glare and smudges but it takes away the clarity so much that I took it off. It's like having an HDTV and watching everything in standard definition. Do not buy, there are other cheaper protectors out there that are way better.
Have tried all type of screen protectors...even multiple Zagg products...on various devices. This is by far the best of the lot. Zagg glossy screen protectors are good but this anti-glare, anti-smudge protector stands alone. Will it diminish, somewhat, the clarity?...a little...but this is a result of the anti-glare technology and is more than a equitable trade-off. The anti-smudge aspect works well too. One of the reasons I recommend this protector is ...I have the Zagg protector on my phone and then have the iphone in a Otterbox defender protective case with its own screen protector. Slicker screen protectors can cause a " moisture " look between the 2 protectors...but not this one. I have used the slick and anti glare Zagg protectors on many devices and their protection is first rate. I recommend using both the Zagg and the Otterbox case for dual protection. The Zagg for adding strength and scratch protection to the glass face, in a case or not , then with the Otterbox case as a durable second screen/device protector. Neither affect the touch screen performance. With a little care and patience...they are fairly easy and straight forward to apply.
Despite all of the negative reviews on this product, I would have to disagree with many. It is unfortunate that most believe they wasted their money on this product, the only thing I felt like I wasted money on was paying them $8 to apply this screen on my phone. This product makes the screen a little fuzzy looking no doubt, but it does its job well, protecting it from any scratches. What got me was the lifetime warranty too. Over a few months the screen came a little loose next to the home button (iphone 4) and then some dirt got underneath it. I went online to their site and requested a replacement. I had to pay for shipping which was very cheap anyways and then next thing I know it, I received the replacement. I applied the screen myself this time (probably better than the best buy guy) and if anything is wrong, I look forward in getting another replacement. Overall, this is one of the best screen protectors on the market and you should consider it when buying.
Very disappointed in this product. Distorted the screen so bad, it hurt my eyes. Not smudge free at all. I'd rather have scratches on my screen than this on my phone. Don't waste your money. Best Buy will not refund. Trust me, I just saved you $25.00. Wish I could get my money back.
This product stinks. Grainy look cand see screen well and I is smudge proof because it always looks smudged. Hurts your eyes too
This is my first Zagg product and if the rest are the same will be my last. Do NOT BUY this shield unless you care less about screen resolution and clarity. I wasn't expecting 100% same resolution experience but this thing makes the retina display as you looking a Palm Treo.. Definitely will send it back. Was anyone able to return it to Bestbuy? thanks
I had the regular Zagg screen protector on my old iPhone 3GS and loved it. So naturally I purchased one for my new iPhone 4S. I didn't turn my phone back on for 4 hours after installing it and when I did I immediately saw how fuzzy or grainy the display looked. I put it side by side with my husband's iPhone 4 without a screen protector and mine just looks awful. Even my old 3GS looks better than this. If you don't care about the wonderfully sharp and clear retina display on your iPhone 4/4S, then go ahead and get this. Otherwise, do not buy it.
I followed the application instructions and it went on fairly easily. After a day of having the phone in my purse, the corners of the "shield" are peeling up and getting dirt under them. Also still has some bubbles under the front shield, but those are suppose to work themselves out. All in all, not what I expected and certainly not worth the money I paid for it. Will be contacting Best Buy to see about a refund. (Zagg offers a 45 day money back guarantee, so I hope Best Buy honors it.)
With the shield on, the clarity of the screen is greatly reduced. However, the biggest problem is that after a while, the shield develops black discoloring on the side stuck to the screen. This is the second shield I have had on my iPhone 4 and it developed the same discoloring as the first one after a few weeks. This was a waste of my $25.00 - don't buy!
Bought this because it was cheaper than other brands, and I regret it. The clarity of my screen definitely has suffered. Really wish I had done some research and bought a better brand
I'm reading the reviews for this product and I'm surprised of how horrible they are describing it. It's not causing my phone to have a glare and I'm able to see my phone if I'm out in the sun. As for the clarity maybe it dulls it very little but it's hardly noticeable. What's great though is Zagg has a warranty so if you really dislike it you just have to let them know.
I wanted a matte screen protector because the glossy ones always look dirty to me. Also, I wear powder and foundation and it tends to stick to the glossy ones more. I get that when clean, the glossy protectors look better, but this one just works better for me. I also love that I can see it better in the sunlight. ONE MAJOR PROBLEM: It covers the proximity sensor in the iPhone. It won't affect the black iPhone, but it will affect the white iPhone. Basically this sensor will turn the screen black when you hold it to your ear so that your face won't hang up on or mute your call. The protector made it so that the sensor didn't work and would hang up on anyone I was calling. It would also start calling people via Facetime. Best Buy was going to replace my phone because they thought that the proximity sensor was defective, but one of the associates pulled the protector off and the phone works perfectly without the protector. So, to use the white iPhone with this screen protector, you will have to cut the part of the protector that covers the proximity sensor off. Then it will work fine. I wish the people at the Best Buy who sold me the phone knew about this because it would have saved me a lot of frustration and a second trip to Best Buy.
This was the worst Zagg product. It made my screen resolution worse where I could barely even see the screen. Do NOT buy.
One of the most disappointing purchases I've ever made: $30 spent on this item and its installation. What other reviewers have said is true: One of the main reasons you buy an iPhone 4 is because of the beautiful Retina display. So you should take heed of the following... WARNING: THIS PRODUCT WILL ABSOLUTELY DESTROY THE BEAUTY AND CLARITY OF THE RETINA DISPLAY. It blurs and pixelates the screen with a kind of irritating iridescence. (That's the best way I know to describe it.) Smudge-proof? Maybe. No-glare? Not on your life. I ripped this thing off in disgust and threw it away after a few days. I kept waiting for the "rainbow"-ness of the screen to fade away, but it never did. AVOID AT ALL COSTS.
It does well against smuges and fingerprints. It protects the screen pretty good with scratches, but it is not anti glare. (it is not translusent) It makes the images on the the screen look fuzzy. It does not cover the entire screen as well and it tends to slide around covering up the camera. Have to keep moving it back into place.
$25 for 1 shield and it looks awful!!! I followed the instructions and the shield itself doesn't fit on the iphone. The camera hole is too small and you can see it when you take a photo. I tried to take it off and put on another one, when low and behold, there was no other case in the box. I can't believe I paid $25 for ONE shield. What a ripoff! I bought an iFrogs anti-glare for my ipod touch and it's amazing. It never came off, still on to this day (a year later) and it had more than one in the box for less than $25. I picked this protector because it was the only one left at the Union Sq Best Buy and I should have just bought the iFrogs online. This is an awful brand I'll never buy again.
Not that Zagg makes bad products, but I always hated the shiny, somewhat sticky of the their other products. This one is great!!! Protection, Great no smudge finger print free!!! I wish they made it for more phones.
Not recommended! peels off right away, doesn't fit its to small..looks terrible...just get the 20.00 original zagg fits perfect and looks awsome..
I have been using the Zagg shields on my phones since they became popular a few years ago and I have been very happy with other Zagg products. I was going to replace the shield on my iPhone and thought I would give the Smudge Free version a try. I had to replace it again the next day... Like previous Zagg shields, if you follow the installation instructions, the shield goes on very well. This version did not look or feel good at all. It says smudge free but it is not, it left as many fingerprints as other shields. It did take a little bit of the glare away in bright areas but the screen had a very strange feel and the visibility of the screen was very blurry which takes away from the awesome iPhone screen.
1. This version DEFINITELY reduces the screen quality. 2. The cutouts do not align properly with the home button and earphone speaker. There is no way to install without covering some of one or the other. 3. After only 22 days the cover started to peel. I don't mean peeling off the device, but actually separating on its own; like it's shedding its skin. But this peeling layer won't come off easily or in one piece, so it's really frustrating.
Before I bought this I had an Otter Box and while I really like it I didn't like the glare and also I had to remove the case a lot in-order to put it on my iHome alarm clock. This really does eliminate glare and you don't leave behind any smudges (i ended up popping out Otter Box's screen because if you don't you still have the glare and smudging issue). I have heard a lot of horror stories about installing these yourself but the young man in the department told me they can install them, which didn't take long and was done really well, plus if they mess it up its on them. Only downside is it doesn't cover the entire front of the iPhone 4. There is a small strip left exposed evenly around the edges.
I bought one of these for my Iphone 4 after having a regular Zagg invisible shield for my 3GS. The protector resists smuges and glare as advertised at the cost of losing you retina screen resolution. To put it short, it makes the screen look horrible. I returned it and bought/installed the regular invisible shield and I'm happy now.
Had product for 2 weeks starting to peel, sign up for replacement. Cost of $3.99 for shipping, eventhough package says free replacement, and no where not even in small print does it say plus shipping. Called customer service they gave me free shipping code, but now want my credit card in case they dont receive the broken screen protector back, in enough days they will charge my card full price. No thank you, You will not take my money then tell me if you received my return on time. Feels like set up to keep $$ would rather buy another product you dont have to jump through these hoops to get "FREE" replacement. BUYER BEWARE! And screen does look fuzzy compaired to original screen.
I bought a "Zagg" product for my iPad and loved it, so I thought I would stick with this brand. Unfortunately, the anti-glare makes for terrible screen resolution. It actually gives me a headache when I stare at it. I'm considering taking it back to Best Buy and ask what my options are since I threw away the packaging. I would try a different "Zagg" product, just not the anti-glare, anti finger print screen protector.
I had bestbuy install my Zagg screen saver on the new iphone i bought from them and i really like it, its clear screen so i see everything, it stays in place, won't smuge, it doesn't even seem like its there. great product.
I got this because I'm clumsy and figured my new iphone would get scratched. This product said it was scratch proof, glare proof, smudge proof. SO far is has been all of the above but, what is does not tell you is that you give up the clarity of the screen itself. I use my phone and then use my boyfriend's and his is so much clearer and nicer! Over all it's ok
I think the screen protector is a good buy for protecting your phone and I like this one alittle better than the shiney ones because of no shine and no sticky finger feel but I feel it leaves the screen looking fuzzy or not as clear as it should. They need to come out with one that is between the two not shiney but yet a clear screen
I had the full body protector on my iPhone which was fantastic, but I got a case and wanted to switch to the Zagg cover that was a little smaller so I could use them together. I pulled off my full body cover and put this one on but the screen resolution is awful. The cover brings out the pixels and ruins the high resolution. It's so bad that I am returning it tomorrow morning, less than 24 hours after purchasing it. If you don't care about the pixel issue, it doesn't show fingerprints which is a plus, but why have an iphone if the screen is going to look terrible?
My first iPhone, my first iPhone case. My iPhone is white so I thought the Belkin blue with white trim would be sharp. Which it was, for the first couple weeks. I have a touch of OCD and keep my hands as clean as I can, but no matter what I did the white trim still turned a funky grey and no amount of hot water & soap will clean it. I recommend this Belkin style, but I won't be choosing another with white. Will see if BB lets me exchange but since it's been 31 days since I bought it they might turn me away; we'll see.
So far so good. Love the color and fit. Good purchase.
I got this case when I got my iPhone 4. It was a combo with the invisible shield. It is great to start off with but not for "clumsly people". Does not protect if continually put the phone in danger. Great product great price!
I wanted a basic case that would provide basic protection agains scratches and provide more anti slip. This case looks good and provides both.
I love this case, it's not an otter box obviously but it does it's job of protecting the phone well.
This is a great product. I have already dropped my phone several times and it stays on and it protecting the phone.
I recently bought this case for my Iphone 4S and it's so perfect for my phone. I never had problems with it and it looks great. Looks durable, the price was so great, very affordable. I love the combination of blue and white color plus you can still see the apple logo at the back. I give this a two thumbs up!!!
Simple to use and works great, of course I have only had it for a few months so it may suddenly self destruct but i think thats a very low possibility.
I have been on a quest to find the perfect iphone case that does not add bulk. I love the natural feel of the iphone. I have tried just about every case and I love this one for several reasons. First is the design. I love the soft but rugged material used. Also the color scheme: blue on back and white bumper is awesome. The fact that you can see through the back is awesome. Looks sick. Second, the case is thin but thick enough to safe from a drop. Its about .2 or .3 mm thick. Next, it offers all around protection except the screen. Finally, the color scheme with the iphone white looks really good IMO. Love this case. great feel and perfect size.
I love the color, the fact that it's see through in the back so you can see the apple logo, and it's protective.I know that if it weren't for the case, I'd have major scratches on it :) Phew!
connection to iPhone cable does not fit perfectly and you need to double check in order to prevent it does not charge. Not a fair price for the benefit
This is even better than the last belkin case I had. The last one yellowed pretty bad this one it won't happen. So kudos to belkin on another great case!
Nice good great awesome case for carry on in you pocket
I do like the case. I was looking to switch from the rubberized Otter Box case that tends to stick to my pocket when I try to grab it. Unfortunately the Belkin case doesn't seem to offer much for shock absorption. I then realized quickly once I got into the car that my auxiliary plug doesn't fit into the opening the Belkin case has for the headphones/auxiliary cord. Problem #2 was when I tried to plug my AV/TV cord to watch Netflix on my TV through my iPhone, the plug in didn't fit because of the extra piece of plastic surrounding the plug in on the phone.
This cover is exactly what I was looking for. I have a white phone and it matches perfectly. My fav color is blue. I didn't want to cover up my new iPhone totally. I like the fact that the front of my phone is totally visible. You can even see the silver apple thru the translucent back. All of the buttons line up great! What I really liked was that this was part of a bundle with a ZAGG invisible shield, and they even installed the shield for me. Thanks BestBuy!
I bought this case with my phone to hold me over until the case I ordered came in. The fit is somewhat questionable. The sides tend to bow out away from the phone. If you shop around online, you can find a much more protective case than this for the same price. I would not trust this case to protect against much of anything.
The best phone case ever bought and it's my favorite color.
The cover installs nicely. The buttons line up and work well. The texture is just right; smooth enough to not get hung up when putting into or taking out of my pocket but enough grip to not slip in my hand.
I did not think that this product would last and actually work. I realized that it is a Great product and tough too!
Covers the phone nicely and protects the outer edge.
The case is great for protecting my phone. It is rugged, tough and water tight. But, it is hard to open/close the charging flap after charging the phone. Otherwise, it works great and really protects the phone.
Probably the best and toughest case on the market. Expensive, but worth it because you don't have to buy screen protection. It's already built in.
I've seen what happens to an unprotected iPhone when dropped. Not pretty, shattered glass on front and back. I wanted to be able to have confidence carrying my phone everywhere and anywhere. I really like the camouflage look, and have received may complements on this choice of cover. It does beef up the size of the overall phone but that is the price you pay for the protection.
I am an android user, but I decided to switch to the iphone for personal reasons. I have only heard good things about the iPhones so I wasn't nervous about the switch. I do not think the iPhone lives up to its hype though. First of all I am obviously comparing my iPhone experience to the android so if you are switching over like I did you may want to think again. The battery life is not that good. I understand with all the texting, calling, and data usage that any phone would have this problem- iPhones just have it worse. Most of the time when i touched a button it wouldn't respond and I would have to touch it at least 3 more times to get it to act. There are too many steps to do one simple thing. I am used to touching a text message to delete it or touching a widget to call someone. the iPhone takes 3 steps to make a phone call. You can not customize this phone at all. I am used to the android where you customize everything and I just wasn't aware how you have no freedom on the iPhone. Siri takes some getting used to- you have to make sure you say what you want a certain way for her to understand what you are asking her. Another problem I had that most people may not was that I couldn't sync selected items. I did not want the iPhone to sync my facebook comments but there was no way to get it to stop. Which this probably had something to do with the battery life not being good. On my android i was just able to customize it and have it do whatever i wanted. I do like the style of the iPhone and its phone calls were very clear. Facetime was awesome too!! I'm just not used to all the restrictions so I will be taking this phone back and getting a different android.
As with all Apple products this is a good phone, the only issue is not updating emails when they come in. the best that I have seen so far and very largmemoryry.
FaceTime and Siri are excellent aspects of this phone. Like the conferencing capability but complicated on 1st use.
The device itself is great, but the lack of 4G data is only justified by Siri. iPhones are just plain easy & fun to use and it makes people happy to use them for play & work. The next iteration of Apple's iPhone will have 4G data capability and might even coincide with Sprint's launch of their new 4G LTE network. If you have Sprint and have wanted an iPhone, the iPhone 4 S is worth it just for Siri.
This is a great case, for its designed use. This adds some protection for the day-to-day use, but it is no Otter-Box. This will not protect your iphone from a random spill nor a 20 ft drop. It is more of a demonstration of personality than security. It has a fun and organic look that always brings compliments.
Very disappointed with this case. The green in the picture is completely different. The color on the actual case is an olive green. I will be returnig this case.
The case feels much more solid than my former Incipio case that started cracking in a couple of months. It fits my Verizon iPhone 4 fine. Only complaints are very nit-picky. The plastic shell was a little warped in the package so there is a place where it sits just a millimeter out of place around the flexible part. The flexible part has a flap that covers the sync port and folds back, but it already doesn't sit perfectly tucked into the plastic shell. But if the problem was serious, I'd return it. I like the slightly textured outer feel and the inner part is about as substantive as you can expect considering it has to be relatively thin and flexible. All in all, it went on pretty easily and fits pretty snugly. It's solid but not too heavy and it doesn't look like it will crack too soon. The top button is hard enough to push that I won't keep pressing it in my pocket.
I've never used an apple product before so I'm still learning, but I love it so far.
Hi, I've prob like many have owned many different Cell/Smart phones & 2 me the iPhone is the best by far In my opinion! I already own the iPad, and before buying an iPod, i did a rigorous study 4 myself on mp3 players & barr none it beats all, so getting the iPhone was a Logical choice!
I love this phone. Great functionality, apps run with little to no problems, durable, great music quality.
The iPhone 4S Siri is great - use it all of the time
The speed and reliability of the iPhone 4S, the quality of the camera, and the huge number of useful apps make this a great phone. The only downside is that the battery life is subpar -- especially when Siri is enabled. With any significant use, it is easy to run out of battery power in less than 24 hours.
it is as good as advertised. alot of apps i really enjoy using.
What's to say, it's an another great Apple device. I've been using it for about 3 weeks and haven't found anything bad to say except maybe I'm nervous about dropping or losing it.
I LOVE THIS PHONE. IT IS EVERYTHING I EXPECTED AND MORE.
This is my first smart phone, so I really don't have anything to compare it to. But... It does everything I could ever want. I love texting with it!!! It is so simple, I did not need any help figuring out how to use it. I like to take pictures and small videos, but the light does have to be perfect in order to do this. I have downloaded all of my favorite music on it. Most important, it charges so incredibly fast. I did not buy a battery backup for it, and right now I don't see a need. I like to listen to my music at the racetrack (drag racing) between rounds; I absolutely don't have any problem with the battery dying. But please note, I don't play it non-stop for hours -- just a little between rounds or longer if someone oils the track down.
It's like having an assistant strapped to your belt. The SIRI is amazing - at times I feel like it is traching me.
Everything works so smoothly on this phone. It helps me to stay organized with my appointments.
The product is good just i needed to wait about 30 min to get my phone, people in Best Buy was little bit lazy.
best phone ever. use friendly even if you are an "old dog" learning new tricks!
We have 3 iPhones in our family. The 4S is similar to the 4's that we have but the addition to the Siri. Son and wife love the Siri feature. The 4 and 4S were the same price so it was a no brainer.
This is my first iPhone and I really like it. The only thing I have a problem with is Siri. Sometimes she works and sometimes she doesn't.
I had an iPhone 3g before. The camera on the 4S is much better! Love the apps that I can get with this phone, too. I'm happy I got it.
Since I already had the iPhone 4, I knew buying the 4S for my wife would be excellent for her needs. She picked up on the usage of the touchscreen and app's really fast. The camera works much faster than the 4 and Siri is a nice gizmo that she enjoys. Now the biggest criticism of this phone is it's inability to connect to a Jawbone Bluetooth device. Seems like alot of folks have the same problem from what I've read on the Apple blogs. We still have not resolved the issue yet. Overall, an excellent product that get's better as she finds new uses. I'm hoping she will go to a Mac Notebook soon and the syncing will make the phone that much sweeter.
Great overall product! Satisfied with my purchase.
This phone has become so advanced it's hard to call it a phone, it is so much more then that!
I have been debating on the switch for months now, as much as i love Andriod theres just too many phones out there that cant really use the software smoothly, up unitl now! Since the phones are faster then my first pc when i was kid, seem to run Andriod alot smoother, and as intended. I however did switch to the Iphone 4s this time around, having most of my music on itunes its kinda nice speical when syncing / wireless as well now! However Itunes have seem to taken a few of Androids ideas, but come on they have to , to keep up. I miss my Android, speical with Razer thats out now, but at least with the Iphone you set with a smooth interface, and if you havent played with Siri, my Girlfriend is already Jelious. Yes i know there are some other speach to txt apps out there, but come on, this is soooo much better!, Sent a reminder when i get home to make shoping list to go to store, call parents, make apt with Drs office. All hands free, and adds to my reminders, as well as setting up my calendar. I think Apple can show the more techy ppl like me some more love, with out jail breaker there phone, some of us just dont want to . Pros, good phone,m easy to use, smooth os, Siri will be your secret lover. Cons miss my widgets, miss my live walscreens, dont care if they eat a little more battery. and more customisation, and could be slightly bigger
Aside from wanting a bigger screen, and all those fancy new bells & whistle's, the new iPhone is a strong addition to the already reliable iPhone product line. So putting my wants aside, and focusing on exactly what this device is, my review is still rating this phone as 5 stars. The battery life on the iPhone is very strong, and I feel outlasts many of it's competitor's. iOS 5 has multiple new additions, and so far has ran smoothly in my opinion for all my uses. The screen clarity is wonderful, and the updated camera hardware makes for GREAT pictures. Never had a problem with any of my photo's taken on this product. The faster processor has a noticeable zippiness to it, that makes for a smoother transition when running/opening app's. I do not utilize a case for my phone, and keep it in my pocket and it has proven to have a fairly strong casing against scratches. The keyboard on all iPhone's seem to have a much more "ease of use" and fairly more comfortable and accurate to use than other operating systems I've experienced. As for Siri, I haven't utilized it near it's full potential, but have found a few things it offers to be very useful. Overall I find it a worthy upgrade to the current iPhone's available, and with it's solid, stand-up performance I am overall very happy with my purchase. One further item to note, I initially had purchased the Droid Bionic and wound up ultimately let down/unpleased with the overall experience I took it back and went with the iPhone 4s!
Great purchase and the account executive in Peoria store is awesome, This phone is copy of iPhone 4 with 2 extra features 1. Siri which is voice command interpreter 2. Better camera Its also faster than 4 but you won't notice any difference in browsing speed or anything, So if you have 3GS it's a good upgrade but upgrading from iPhone 4 will be waste of money.
I have been a Blackberry user for years; I thought I would hate this phone, but love everything about it! I tried the Droid when it first came out and could not get the hang of the touch screen, so I was worried about making this costly purchase. So far I have not had any trouble with the screen and love the phone. The battery life is great, unless you keep a lot of apps running, then you will need to charge it mid way through the day. The one thing I do not like is that it does not come with a manual; there are so many things you can do with this phone that a booklet showing what the icons mean would be nice. I do not want to download and print one myself and for the price of the phone, it should be included. Overall I am very happy with my purchase and the longer I have it and learn new things from other Apple users, I will be able to do more with it. I will not be going back to the Blackberry!
Great Phone, glad Verizon finally has it!!!!!!!!!!
coming from having a blackberry --this is a great product but have to get used to the keyboard.
The iPhone 4S is a super phone and makes great pictures and video.
Call Quality: Through Verizon Wireless, I have noticed that calls are almost never dropped, Cell services everywhere I travel in the Southeast, Northeast, and Southwest. Obviously major cities (Orlando, Phoenix, Providence) have better coverage than rural, but I don't notice a difference in call quality whether it be 1 bar or 6. However, sometimes I can hear a buzzing noise from the phone's speaker. I had the phone replaced, and it still occurs. I assume this may be my sensitive hearing as I haven't found many people complaining of this issue. Picture Quality: Because of the retina display (326 pixels per inch) and the high native contrast, pictures and videos look great on this screen. I have seen a couple of Samsung screens with larger sizes and 16:9 aspect ratios, but I still am quite partial to my iPhone screen. Especially when it comes to watching darker films during the day. Watch Batman the Dark knight on a Samsung GSIII and the iPhone 4s and you will see the many more details the iPhone can come up with in shadowed areas. Battery Life: Normally I can go about 2 full days before I need to charge my iPhone. Now if I am playing games frequently, that number goes down to a day, but still an improvement to what I used to use. Value for Price: 5GB of iCloud storage, free iCloud backup, Siri integration, Turn by Turn navigation, Best App Store, Best music Store, iTunes Match, etc. These things make it hard to switch to a different phone manufacturer, and couple that with subsidized pricing; Yeah it's hard to beat. Sound Quality: The sound that comes out of the speaker on the phone itself is atrocious. I have heard a couple of phones that can do some great things with audio, and the iPhone isn't one of them. However, because of AirPlay I can push it to any system that supports it, or an Apple TV and listen to much, much better speakers. Get yourself some nice headphones and this becomes a non-issue.
So I will just highlight the main things that were wrong with this unit other than the fact that the one I ordered came with factory blemishes on the case. 1) The case leaves the front face of your phone completely exposed in the event you drop it. 2) This case adds a lot of weight despite claims of being the slimmest case in the market. 3) If you take the issue from number 2 and add it to scenario 1 you are increasing your odds of the screen being ruined because you have now added what felt like an additional pound to the phone. 4) Doesn't form fit like the Mophie case. There is a plastic piece that comes on top of the phone that really doesn't feel like it does anything to protect your phone. 5) The phone was not able to be charged while in this case. I kept getting the accessory not supported message. I was going to give this product 2 stars until I saw how much I typed and reduced it to one. I would suggest to best buy that they have a case testing station where you can see how it will feel on your phone before you get home and are completely disappointed. If you are looking for a case check out Mophie and my review about their case.
I am a former palm and droid user, this phone blows them away.... Will never go back....
Ordered an iPhone 4S through PayPal and BestBuy online. Picked up in store same day, no hassle! My problem was with the carrier, V, returned to BestBuy, with absolutely no hassle!!! People are split 50/50 whether it is the phone or the carrier that cant hang onto a call, but, I loved the phone. Likely to buy an unlocked for use with my present carrier!?!
Bought two iphone 4S 64 gb from Best Buy. Salesman was extremely knowledgeable. He canceled my previous phone with AT&T, enrolled me into Verizon, sold me two phones, assured me that two GB's was going to be enough data per month for my lifestyle, and transferred all my contacts and photos in less than 30 minutes. Man was I impressed! Phones are great. Can do everything!! Good selection of protective cases. Much fun. No Complaints!
I went from Android to the iPhone 4S. I like the phone quite a bit, however... 1) GPS functionality pales to Android. With Android I was able to use GPS almost anywhere. Not so with 4S - I seem to need cellular connectivity. Seems poor. 2) Apparently Google Maps is crippled for iPhone - no voice nav. I would have to pay dearly to have it. Looks like a yearly fee. Poor - it's free with android. Other than that, it's a fine device. Intergrates very well with my wifes iPad2. Facetime is great. I miss the GPS functionality and voice nav - those are the things that would make me consider going back to Android. I also like the easy way that I can create/access files on the Android. I hate having to go through iTunes to do everything, plus the fact that iTunes seems to want to re-sync everything if I even change 1 song/file. Other than those nits. It's great.
I've been putting off on buying a smartphone for too many years, always concerned that I'll purchase one and it'll be out of date within two months. That may still happen, but I see myself being very happy with the 4S for a long time. Siri is fabulous; iTunes and the selection of Apps make this phone well worth the investment. Email connectivity - seamless, unlike a friend's Droid X - has literally changed the way I do business at home. A great product, as you've heard thousands of times over.
Happy with my iPhone, great product. Easy to use. good text, pictures and music, great apps highly recomend
Excellent Phone coming from a Blackberry which was so slow.The Iphone is so much faster internet actually works don't have to wait forever to load a page and the apps are awesome. Overall just a fantastic product. Highly Recommend .
I was an android user from Droid 1 and have had 4 different android phones and a xoom. I was tired of the fragmentation within the android community and decided to give up my iTouch and android phone for the iPhone. I have had it for a couple months now and I am still smiling. The iPhone us a smooth OS and I am not missing my android as much as I thought I would. For a person that does not want to root/jailbreak a phone and wants email, music, games, calendars, messaging and the helpfulness of siri this phone will work for you.
I waited along time for the IPHONE to be available on verizon. Wish I had waited a little longer for IPHONE 5 With 4G service
I bought this to replace a Droid X. While I am an android lover, the fact that phone makers want to modify the Android OS to the point where it is worthless is what has made me come bcak to an iPhone. I had a 3GS in 2010 and this phone is leaps and bounds beyond that phone. While there are vast improvements from the 3GS, there is definately room for further improvement. The one thing I miss the most already is Swype. That is an amazing tool, especially if you regularly text or email from your phone. I know there are apps in the app store for the iPhone but those I have found don't come close to the android Swype. But I have found that the voice recognition on the iPhone blows the Android out of the water. I was regularly having to correct words when I would voice a text message or email on my Droid X, but so far I have found that pretty much every word I speak, whether to Siri or directly into a text message is spot on. They have definately caught up to Android in a way, but still have some room to make improvements. Compared to the Droid X, this phone blows it out of the water....it is quick, very responsive and on Verizon's network, it is nice to have a phone that works again instead of locking up cause it has to catch up.
The camera got an upgrade, the SSD was doubled from 32 to 64GB, the apps are still the most robust in the market. This phone in short is a mini computer as it does just about everything one could ask for all while fitting in your pocket. Also Facetime is a great feature as I use it all the time with my closest friends.
I have had the origianl Droid and the Bionic and this phone is head and shoulders better then the droids.
This is my first iPhone, so I guess I was expecting it to do everything... but it doesn't! I acrually liked my Blackberry Torch (with the keyboard and full interactive screen) mucvh better for functionality. That being said, the camera on this phone is great. The ability to send photos with only a couple of clicks is awsome. And the ability to edit photos is great, too. I still don't know all the ways to use the phone, as the iPhone instructions leave a lot to be desired! I purchasedf it from BestBuy and while they were really helpful with the purchase and adding my contacts, they lost interest after that and support was non-existent for learning functionality. It obviously does all the basic iPhone stuff and the apps are good. The biggest problems are the battery and Siri. The battery life is extremely poor! The first time I used the phone I was out and needed to take some photos. Starting with a full battery charge I was able to take 19 pictures and then the battery was completely gone! This is extremely poor, and shile Apple knows about this fault, they haven't done anything to improve it yet! Siri is a great idea and one of the reasons I bought the phone. My particular phone works if you turn on the microphone manually, but not if you just put it up to your ear - as advertised. Also, although she 'learns', you really can't do a whole email with sentences and punctuation. It's a one-line service only. So the advertising is quite false, but it's a good idea. Would I recommend this to a friend? I would suggest they give a Blackberry a good test first, as well as the iPhone, or else stay with the 4s until Apple works out the glitches with the battery life and Siri.
My issues with this phone's perfection are this. Siri doesn't understand me, the call quality is kind of echo-y, as if I'm talking into one of those fake kids microphones that really just echo their voice to amplify it, the battery life isn't the greatest and the keyboard letters are a bit small even for my fingers. It has a great amount of memory and otherwise everything with it is awesome, it just takes a little bit of transition time from using a non-smart phone.
Easy easy easy to use. with phones OS you have to have a PhD. to figure it out. this is ready to go. And now with the cloud its even easier to keep all your "stuff" with you all the time. It is quite simply the best smart phone in the world.period.
making it greater. Everyone complaining about how it has to change shape is complete nonsense. Apple already had a great design, best screen on the market, tons of cases, why change? Why change usability of a product that everyone already loves? Apple did what it does best and that is making a product as best as it possibly can. I was a perfect example of an Apple hater in fact my job for the last 13 years was to write code for Microsoft products and still is. After owning 2 iPads (both versions), the new MacBook Air (13"), and now the iPhone 4s (64gb), I am truly impressed by Apple and will never hate again. Fact is Jobs turned the company around and the iPhone 4s is a great phone to be remembered by his hand before he passed. The product works exactly how you expect in every way. The ONLY issue I see is price especially when you want capacity but at least you have options. With iOS5 and iCloud managing information across multiple apple platforms is effortless, backing up information is automatic, and sharing information like photos across devices is easy enough my mom can do it. It's funny how we forget that this device fits in our pocket but can tell us where we left it, send emails, give us driving directions, lookup any website, and even talk to us with a decent form of artificial intelligence. And yes SIRI (the AI for iPhone) does work so much better than the "other" platforms it nailed EVERY word dead on and never misunderstood what task I asked. Now if they can just figure out how to get 4g on the iphone without draining a battery incredibly fast (which is why they don't have an iphone 4g yet). 5 out of 5 for me love it in every way. Ex android user...
I love my iPhone 4S 64gb! It's been a great phone so far for me! Recommended by a friend and my family, I am happy I took their advice! I love having Siri and the iPhone 4S takes great pictures without having to bring along a digital camera on vacations. I can do a lot with my iPhone...it's my life and helps me to stay organized!!
My 15 year old loves this phone. It does everything a highschooler could dream of.... He read books on it, takes pictures, plays games, listens to music, calls home, and watches shows or movies on it.
I had a thicker cover with a belt clip but it was just to bulky. I've had this cover on my iphone for a month now and I still like it. It's slim and goes great with my white phone. Luckily I haven't dropped my phone yet, but I have a buddy who has this same cover and his has survived several drops. It's not bullet proof, but I'm very causious with my electronics. It also fits in the workout band to hold the iphone so you won't have to take off the cover every time you work out.
This case Is really cute and lightweight but doesn't protect worth a dam. I dropped my phone on the sidewalk and didn't even look at it because I thought there would be no scratches but when I looked at it later i noticed scratches not only to the edges of the case but the actual edges of my phone. I also have a screen protector but it made no difference. This case is not worth this ridiculous price if the edges are not protected, which is where most of the damage happens anyway!
It's amazing to me how such a thin, small piece of plastic costs $30. In fact, all iPhone cases have an average cost of $30+. Ridiculous. Since I really don't have a choice, I figured I would go for something that protects the case, and will not make the phone bulky. This case, indeed serve its purpose. I haven't dropped the phone, yet, so I can't say much for its sturdiness. Just like the other reviewer, I too got white on white, and it looks as if I don't even have a case on the phone.
Like anyone who would buy a case like this, I wanted a bit of protection with minimal added girth. The case is stylish, fits great, and feels great in my hand. In actuality it probably adds very little impact protection but it does give me just enough peace of mind. I'm disappointed that it was so expensive, but I didn't find anything else that I liked nearly as much. Also, the image on Best Buy's site shows an apple logo on the back of the case. Mine does not have that. And as another reviewer noted, it does scratch easily.
I don't like adding bulk to my phones and I want it To feel like the manufactures intended them to feel. The ultra lean is amazing. Adds very little bulk and super light. Almost feels like there is nothing on. It may not be the otterbox but I prefer the feel. I highly recommend this if you don't want to compromise the feel of your iPhone. Awesome.
I have tried 3-4 other cases and this one is by far the best one. The case is super thin and doesn't add much size to the phone's overall size. It fits perfect and you have complete access to all ports and buttons. The only gripes I have are; the white scratches easily and I have yet to drop my phone in this case, but I'd bet it doesn't offer as much protection as other cases since it is so thin.
I bought this case because I wanted a slim fitting case that does not feel bulky and gave me the feeling of not having a case on my iphone. This case does exactly that! Mose people cant even tell I have a case on (I have the white iphone & white case) and it feels like I dont have a case on either. For 29.99 I don't feel it's a great value but it looks and feels great! It also seems to protect from most falls.
Great feel and fit! Very nice phone coverage. Looks like metal but is a very nice plastic that won't scratch up like metal.
After reviewing several models of cases my decision to purchase this case finally came down to fit and feel. My new iPhone 4S fits perfect and the texture of the case ensures a secure grip of the phone in your hand. I've had no problem with the camera, flash, or any of the buttons. The case is slim and very low-profile. I'm not sure how anyone could say anything negative about the functionality of this produce. I highly recommend!
I was hoping this would be a good cover for my IPhone 4...not so. The coating on this cover is easily rubbed off, especially if you use a phone doc or holder in your car. In addition, the camera hole on the back does not allow the flash to work properly - you end up with a smokey photo. I gave it a chance, but returned it after a couple of weeks.
Glad I bought this - it makes my white phone stand out.
Cover fits very well. I got a pen mark on it though and it will not wipe off. Overall, I like the cover
This is one of the only products I liked from Belkin. This product is pretty nice. The price was a little too much compared to other cases that I've seen that are similar to this one. But I guess that's because of the brand. I do feel comfortable carrying my iphone everywhere with this case on. Overall the case is pretty good.
I like my phone...it has been a good phone. I like it because its a computer and phone in 1.
Sim card had to be replaced after two days. Transaction took 4 hours with lots of info not transitioned.
From it's stylish design, to it's intuitive iOS software, this phone is an amazing device. Also the camera takes very high quality pics when in HDR more. I highly recommend this phone.
I upgraded from a 3GS to a 4S, it is like going from training wheels to sports car.
hey it's a iphone gave my 4 to my wife got the 4s love it
I can't say enough good things about this phone. It is the finest quality product I own. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a phone.
I just upgraded from an iphone 3GS. The 4S is very fast and SIRI is a great feature! I highly recommend the 4S. The battery life is much longer and the phone is much faster. The only negative is that I wish I had more memory. 16GB is the minimum I would recommend. I wanted more but the price was prohibitive.
A must have phone for anyone who takes a lot of pictures & videos from your phone. And the wireless syncing is great! The best part for me an AT&T customer is on the OS 5.1 update I now got 4G without buying a new phone!
The iPhone 4S is a excellent phone to begin with. with its brilliant web browser and innovative features and now you won't drop calls more often because of the two antennas in the phone. All i can say is apple has done it again!
great replacement phone for the iPhone 3Gs and Itouch
Very amazing with also an amazing camera but im changing and getting a blackberry instead
Apple is one of the world's greatest companies, and for good reason: they make amazing products. The iPhone 4S is no exception. There are so many great things about the iPhone 4S that I don't know where to start? I love how seamlessly the iPhone and iTunes work together to get me the content I want on my smartphone. I use it for music, pictures, videos, surfing the web, getting directions, phone calls, e-mails, calendaring, and so much more. There are some things that I would love to see improved. See my blog about it for specifics: http://jaybos.hubpages.com/hub/iphone5featuresiwant Overall, this is a purchase you will not regret.
I'm very happy with the 4S as my 3G was getting old and very slow. The 4S had a great camera and shoots very nice stills and video. Downloads and general Internet surfing are very fast and the retina display is again a major step up from a 3G. I am not sure I would be as happy if I was upgrading from a 4 to the 4S but from 3G it is like night and day. Call quality is good; iMessage is fabulous; SIRI is better than I thought it would be; Facetime is decent and the GPS/compass features are good too. I find battery life to be more than adequate and charge about once a day. That said, I don't make many calls - just use the Internet features.
I have the original iPhone and finally got to the point of needing to upgrade due to lack of support with some apps, etc. The speed was awful, etc etc. I usually keep my phones a long time. I decided to upgrade to the latest greatest because of that fact. I'm ecstatic to report that I couldn't be happier. The speed is excellent. I rarely if ever get any kind of delayed reaction from it when using it. Everything works great as needed and it's just simply and great device. The camera lens is much much better and I now only use one device, this phone, for everything. The only "con" would be, compared to other phones that are out, the screen size would be nice to be a bit bigger - but really, that's a minor thing. All-in-all, I couldn't be happier.
I love my iPhone 4S! The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I think Apple should incorporate Flash into their devices. That would make them PERFECT! Along with my iPhone, i have an iPad that I love but not having Flash is very disappointing and annoying. To view some things on the web, I have to use my laptop and that's just wrong. I had an Android phone in between my iPhone 3GS and my iPhone 4S and the only things I liked about the Android over my iPhone was Flash and speed (4G vs 3G).
There isn't too much to say about this phone. It's an iPhone...that should be self explanatory. It does everything I want and ATT service provider works great for me. I will stick with the iPhone...I'm just waiting for the next upgrade.
Great phone all the way around. Awesome processor and very user friendly. Best of all, great reception in rural areas, at least locally.
iPhone 4s is the best phone I have ever had its good at all. Siri is amazing. Good thing is it doesnt waste memory. Bad thing is it doesn't have a good battery life. Its price I find it is very good it values every cent and more.
I had the iPhone 3G before this and I can say that Apple has made some great improvements. The most important improvement is that I get a better signal and better clarity over my 3G. I don't have as many dropped calls and I can actually understand the person on the other end of the line. The text messaging feature is still the same and I've gotten used to it and like it alot. With those improvements, the rest is just icing on the cake. Faster processor and better screen make gaming apps much more fun and probably make up half of my usage. The other half is to use it as an iPod and listen to music.
I have nothing bad to say. I upgraded from a 3GS and love it! The camera and features are wonderful; the screen is so clear!
Excellent video and photo quality. Love Siri and iCloud
Excellent Camera Great integration of features and ability to make using them simple. Phone coverage has been better than my previous phone Email, Camera, Facebook, Phone, Itunes... What else do I need? It covers everything and works great. Siri is in beta but even that has been awesome and will only get better...
I used an iPhone 3 Gs for two years, so it was worth upgrading to the 4s as soon as it came out. If you already own a 4, don't upgrade unless you just can't live without Siri (which really does work as well as the ads make it appear). A key issue for me was getting a better signal, since AT&T's signal is nowhere near as strong as Verizon's in this area of north Florida. My 3Gs constantly dropped calls, even in the middle of the city. Best Buy's no-questions return policy (for 30 days) meant that I could give AT&T one more shot with a 4s, and then switch to Verizon if I so chose. Turns out that the 4s works great, so I did not have to switch careers after all.
My first iPhone, first smart phone, so I've really nothing to fairly compare/contrast. I'm retired and don't use the phone constantly, but I do use it several times daily. I've read of disappointment in regard to battery not holding charge, but I find I'm recharging only every other day. I find Siri sometimes convenient, sometimes frustrating. Siri doesn't always get things 100% right. That said, one does get a chance to proofread & edit before sending messages, so I'm glad Siri's there as an option. The fact that the phone is so complex, so multi-featured, and yet so intuitive is (over-used word:) amazing. Thank you, Steve Jobs!
The reason I'm giving 4 stars is do to Siri! I only have a 200m data plan so my Siri only works on wifi cause I refuse to pay AT&T and Verizon's high prices! So siri is worthless! Also the great pictures are nice unless you want to post them on facebook or something because again you run into data usage! So basically I should of just keep my iPhone 4 :( AT&T& Verizon wonders why apple is trying to branch off to carriers with unlimited data plans!
Great improvement over the iPhone 4, better performance and greatly enhanced camera. Siri doesn't seem to understand southern accents, but I can live with that.
First of all the styling makes handling your phone easier, access to volume buttons much improved to the 3rd generation iphone. The screen is sooo crisp, pictures are fast, take one right after the other. Video is sharp. FaceTime lets you view your call in real time. Icons are beautiful, I love everthing about my new iphone 4S
I love my iPhone. Every feature you could imagine!! However, the battery life is terrible! I previously had the iPhone 4, and the phone held a VERY long charge. I'm not using my iPhone 4S near as much as my previous phone and my battery life is almost completely depleted in less than 8 hours.
Its fast and fun. My only complaint is that the key board is to small for an old guy like me
I upgraded my iPhone 4 16GB to iPhone 4S 32GB. The camera is definitely better and the battery life is extended also. I had issues with my home button and my camera on my 4 but none of those issues on the 4S. It has frozen maybe once but no serious issues.
This is my first iPhone. I'm glad that I waited for the 4S. I get a lot of use of the Siri voice feature. Also, synching my devices with iCloud is wonderful. I love that I can take my photos from the phone and photosstream to my other devices & home computer.
Im constantly surprised by everything siri can do. Yesterday just for fun I tried to see if Siri would write training paper for me so I opened a note a wrote a whole page paper via voice dictation, emailed everyone in my department, and then sent a mass text to let everyone know - all using voice commands while in the car. Then I let Siri pick a restaurant for lunch for me. my only complaint is that for some reason Siri thinks its not cold outside when I ask her and it's like 60 degrees. She should know that's cold for south Florida. It's quite a bit faster than my iPhone 4 as well. I also run audio streaming to my pc with shairpoint and the video mirroring to apple tv is sick too. Worth every penny (especially since best buy gave me more money trading in my iPhone4 than the 4s cost anyway).
This is my first IPhone purchase I have made and so for I love it. The phone can pretty much do anything that I was hoping for and more. I have the AT&T version and I have excellent reception as well as speed. The only major issue I have is the battery life. Even after the 5.0.1 update, my battery life is not where it should be. However, I am thankful that I am not having major battery issues that other people are having. Apple is currently trying to fix this problem. Another little problem is the efficiency of Siri. It works fairly well when you are connected via Wi-Fi. Over the data network, it tends to have more hiccups than over Wi-Fi. At times, it will not matter which one you are using, Siri cannot figure out what you are saying or trying to do. Siri is considered a "beta" program so I am being patient and hoping Apple will be able to begin perfecting it in the near future. Other than that, the phone is amazing. I would have no problem making a recommendation for this phone.
The phone is reliable, fast, and can do almost anything!
The iPhone 4s is the fifth model released by Apple. They took a great phone and made it better. The camera is 8 megapixels and shoots 1080p video with true image stabilization. iOS 5 adds iCloud and and tether free syncing. Siri the assistant offers an entirely new way to interact with your phone.
This is a serious upgrade from my 3GS and a terrific buy. I had one minor issue (my fault) and Apple took care of it right away.
Like alot of people I took great care of my 3g waiting for the new phone to come out. Bought it the first day it came out. Love alot of the new features. 4 main problems. Outgoing calls- 80% of the outgoing calls don't go through on my end even though everyone else receives it. I hear an echo and know it won't go through. Email - once i am in 3g and out of wifi my emails state "no sender" "no subject" and a date of 12/31/69. So all incoming emails can't be read until i get back in wifi. Freezes now and then. Biggest problem is that for over a month now Best Buy and AT&T stores don't have anymore 4gs for Att to replace it. I have been on the wait list since the day after it came out. Left business card also. I call and go up to my best buy store every couple days and sorry no phones. Checked 6 other stores in michigan regularly and no phones. Called multiple att stores and sorry no phones. So....My 30 day guarantee is over and I'm stuck with a phone that doesn't work properly. Best buy said sorry!
The iPhone 4S, as stated in the title, has everything a person could need in a phone and then some. Full HD camera, high speed processor, etc. Runs great! No problems with it yet.
Awesome service for when I was in the store to buy it.
Siri is my favorite add on. iOS 5 rocks too. I have tried many voice controlled devices inthe past and never had reliable enough response to make it worthwhile...until Siri that is.
Made the jump from Motorola and LG with the iPhone3Gs. It was the best move. Now, I upgraded to the 4S and it was an incredible jump as well. Faster, better video, and friendlier with SIRI!! The only thing I would have liked is a more durable outer shell. So I recommend a shell cover, like the Otter-box.
I just switched back to this handset from a Sprint based Nexus S 4g and I couldn't be happier. The phone feels more well-built and the screen feels sharper than my previous phone. AT&T's network, at least in Louisville, is at a minimum twice as fast. Siri is ridiculously useful, especially with a handsfree setup.
The best phone out there. Absolutely amazing, its fast and furious. Android users you dont know what your missing. And the best thing about this Phone is the speed, the camera and SIRI, OMG. She is absolutely amazing.
I have experienced numerous occasions of the 4s freezing up... There is no way to reset at that point, just have to let the battery die out. The unit gets quite warm , as this is happening. I will be visiting my Best Buy store this weekend for a new 4s
I am emmencly satisfied with my iPhone 4S I have upgraded from a 3GS so of course there is a world of difference "apples" and oranges to say the least. The retina display is absolutely amazing. The new cameras blazingly fast its clarity truly does rival most point-and-shoot cameras. as a photographer I can really appreciate what they've put into the development of the new camera. it really is the best camera to have on you at all times you never miss a shot. I have also recognized the speed at which apps opening close. animation video and games all are very fluid due to the speed of the new A5 processor. I was wondering why you couldn't navigate multiple routes in Google maps and that problem has been addressed. there are just too many upgrades and to many things to review with the space allowed here. I'm sure there will be many critics but I believe that this iPhone 4S is an absolutely amazing device, and wonderful leap forward into the future of what we can look forward to from Apple as a company. thank you Steve Jobs for your part in this you will be missed greatly this is just a piece of your legacy. last but not least I would like to say just a little bit about Siri. though this is just a beta of what is to come from Siri, I have to say that it works absolutely great. I have spoken this entire review using the Siri addition to the keyboard which is a testament to how well the application works. Thank you Steve, thank you Apple, and thank you Best Buy!
iOS is very smooth, no lag between menus, very fast and good camera for a phone
I had a iphone4, this upgrade has pretty much gone as expected, Siri works sometimes and not others, she tends to do better with women's voices than lower men's voices. battery life is worse than the iphone 4 despite messing with all the settings possible. definitely quicker than the iphone 4, better response, picture quality, etc.
Makes everyday things in life more convenient. I wish it would write its own review though. Because this is a pain in the
I picked this over the 5, not only because of the plug being the same, but, because, I KNEW it would be what I wanted. And this phone has proven to be so. Great for people who want an upgrade from a 3GS.
My new iPhone 4S uses a lot of battery power, but it doesn't seem to guzzle the battery the way my old 3GS did. Sound quality is excellent. The camera is really good. I really enjoy having 32 gigs of storage. There are a bunch of features I haven't learned how to use yet (Siri), but I will eventually.
I had a 4 and decided to get the 4S- well worth it!!!! Traded in my other phone toward this purchase and so I didn't have to pay the full price.... Didn't know you could do that! Over all extremely happy with my phone- love Siri and the better camera!!!!!
I purchased for the looks. Does not protect the phone much because it is very thin. Does not have a non slip feature. I have not been able to take it off the phone!! But is good for the reason I purchased it.
Ok. first of all I love Android phones. Ive been using Androids for the last 4 years, I have 2 samsung galaxy tablets and 2 htc evo 4g lte. But I have to say, I decided to give iphone a try out when my contract had expired. I figured i'll try it for 2 weeks, and if i dont like it, I'll just switch over to andoid before my trial period ends. well, needless to say, ive had the iphone for a couple of months now and I cant put it down! it's the best smart phone out there. it really is. all the other phones that are coming out now are all aimed at the iphone 4s to try and dislodge it from being on the top of the phone chain.... ( get-it). now this is my first iphone. I was anti -apple before but now i have been converted. The whole system is just all about user friendliness. the apps, the way the phone responds to you is just amazing. Apple customer support is the best in the business. My new catch phrase now is " Once you go Iphone, You never go back". this thing is truly amazing. let me tell you, if i could marry SIRI, I would!! do yourself a favor, try out the iphone. learn all its features and learn how to use SIRI. I guarantee you you'll be converted from android to iPhone in no time.
I purchased this phone before going out of town and after arriving in new york for a months stay, the phone would continually turn off and I (and 3 other users of this same phone) could not get it to turn back on. There were no Best Buys in the area I was in and after finally going to a Radio Shack to see if they had any idea what the problem was they showed me how to hold down the two buttons that would turn it back on. It had gone from 100% charged to 0 in just a few minutes of charging completely. It would take forever to turn on. Because I was out of town for a length of time before I could return the phone, now I have to make do with a refurbished phone, never really having gotten to use my new phone much at all. I understand the person helping me was only doing what she could, but under the circumstances it does look like I could at least have a new phone. I know that my circumstances kept me from returning it within the 30 days; however, they were also beyond my control.
For my non-technical wife (self-admittedly), this has been a fantastic addition. Having lived through the struggles with a Palm and other not-so-friendly devices, this has truly boosted her confidence and efficiency in using technology. She is able to navigate and explore, and my 13-year-old daughter is always at the ready to help out. She is still getting comfortable with "Siri", but I think it is worth getting the "s" version in the long run. And, I highly recommend the Otterbox case -- I wouldn't trust my device to any other.
I went from a Samsung Galaxy S2 to an Apple iPhone 4S. I wouldn't be honest if I said there were features I didn't miss about my Galaxy, but many of those were replaced and even improved upon. There are so many benefits to having a universal platform from accessories to brand recognition. The Siri feature is wonderful, as well as, iTunes App Store. It's like having a computer in the palm of your hand. Amazing!
Switched over to an iPhone in June after hanging with a 'Droid for about a year and a half. The transition to start using the iPhone and particularly web apps was much smoother than when I first got the droid. 3G in Lubbock, Texas leaves a little to be desired. This smart phone is going to be a great solution for me.
overall the phone is great other than the battery life, ? when will flash be available
I love my iPhone 4S. I upgraded from a BlackBerry and am totally hooked to the iPhone. I thought the transition from BlackBerry to iPhone would be hard, but it wasn't. The touch keyboard was a little hard getting use to, but once you get the hang of it, you can type fast like with a regular qwerty keyboard. I love the many apps I can get. Downloading is fast. I just wish that group text replies where private like on my old BlackBerry. On the iPhone, the whole group can see your replies, so if you want privacy, you can't do group text. But that's no big deal. If you want privacy, just text individually even if it is the same text message. I just copy & paste to everyone individually so that the replies can come just to me & no one else.Batter life is great. I use it all day and only charge it overnight. I love my iPhone. I have no regrets.
I waited for a few years to finally make a move away from the Blackberry to an iPhone. I loved the BB physical keyboard, but the apps for the BB were nowhere near as good as the same apps for the iPhone. The 4s solved my keypad phobia problem with the ability to use voice dictation. I will use the virtual keypad now and then and it is not as positive as the physical keyboard, but I'm getting used to it. This phone is also considerably faster in every operational aspect that I've tried so far, way faster.
I love apple!!! If I could've rated this more I would've rated this 1 million!! I would deffinitly encourage others to buy this iPhone
Great phone. Small computer. Mini iPad. All around great. The five will be even better if that's possible.
I have always had an android device and finally changed over to apple. I love the fit and finish feel of the iphone and the ability of all my apple device to share and communicate....calender and music!
My wife seems to like this phone. She does miss widgets tho.
I had nothing but androids and decided to make the switch to Apple. I was told by many that I wouldn't like the switch. But I haven't had any complaints yet! Many say that the apps that are for free on android cost with apple. But the apps that I use both are free on both apple and android. I would reccommend to all.
Initially I couldn't make a simple call from home. Sprint sent me an air rave or wave (forgot what it's called). That helped, but had to do a lot of trouble shooting and resetting. Even had to get another iPhone. Spenttoo much time with technical support. If I didn't have a Mac and an iPad I would've gone back to my android phone. I never had connectivity issues with my android, but battery life was terrible. Much better battery life with 4s.
Coming from a rooted HTC Evo 4G (going between CM7 and Sense-based ROMs), I was concerned that I would be put off by the screen size and Apple's Walled Garden, along with the lack of 4G data and customization options. But I was sick of how Android was slow and inconsistent, and wanted a phone that just worked, and kept working. On top of that I wanted a phone with a consistent software update cycle. From the first time I used my iPhone 4S I found the keyboard to be better designed and I use it with way higher accuracy. I have huge hands and thought a smaller screen would be less typing for me, but it's just the opposite. Apps in general are more consistent and higher quality, and the OS itself flies. You tap an icon the app opens. It's a marvel concept that Android didn't have for me. Lack of 4G hasn't mattered to me too much. I like in a decent service area and am usually connected to wifi. Lack of customization options also hasn't been a big issue. I realized after a week or so that all of the time I spent changing things on my Evo I was trying to make it more usable, convenient, and give it a cleaner look. My iPhone was most of that right out of the box. The battery lasts longer than my Evo's did, even with me constantly using it. I just can't put it down! Overall, great device, and 16 GB doesn't sound like much, but I've never gone over 60% storage, with 60+ apps installed and a 4GB iTunes library.
Had to pay for this and could have got a phone that is easier to use and better service for free. The service sucks with sprint. Apple is overpriced and I can't believe that are made in china for the price u pay!!! I had a better NYC phone 3 years ago. Apple sucks!
This phone has been amazing so far! I love how simple it is to use! I love the camera. Battery life isn't to bad but I do also use my phone a lot for apps and texting so in the long run it is pretty good.
I got this phone for my wife. She loves it and all the capabilities it has. It was very easy for her to learn quickly! She uses it more than she ever used her previous phone and really enjoys being able to check her email, facebook and go to the internet easily wherever she is. The camera is great and she now uses it more than our regular camera. With it linked to iCloud she doesn't have to fiddle with downloading the pictures to her laptop, it's done automatically.
figured I would love it since the first iPhone came out... but I was loyal to Sprint and I didn't want to leave their service. so I waited patiently and was well rewarded. internet speeds are more than fast enough, great connection and call clarity like Sprint always has been, and the device itself is as solid as can be. no complaints.
I personally prefer and use Android phones, but this phone was for my son and I didn't want to have to support an Android phone when he changed something without understanding what he had done. With the iPhone, I don't have that problem and that's why I wanted him to have the iPhone. Siri is fun to play with and works well for the most part.
Its a very good phone as most techno-centric people already know.
If I would've known this phone was so great I would've been #TeamIPhone along time ago!
Great phone however just one month after having it, I had to get another phone from the apple store. Phone was damaged :(
I really like this phone. It has some awesome apps that you can use on it.
Absolutely love this phone! Will never switch. Camera great. Apps are better. Everything is better!!
This phone is great I can use it for everything. My last phone was an android and doesn't even compare with how awesome this phone is. Love all the features and can't complain.
Easy to use, everything's great. the short baattery like is the only down fall but there are ways to moderate that
like it alot, super cute and thats all that matters
It was time to upgrade my phone to stay in synch with my wife. She upgraded to an iPhone 4S so I decided to do the same. I am impressed with the speed of the phone and apps and duration of the battery.
This is my first iPhone and it lives up to the expectations. It's very easy to use and navigate. Easy to download apps and syncs with my macbook for itunes and updates. Bluetooth with my car is great and syncs through the usb for itunes. I have had a couple glitches with the phone function not disconnecting from a call. Also I haven't been able to use Syri successfully either.
Overall the 4S is a great device especially for a beginner to the data world. I use it as an assistant, game station, and phone. Phone is very fast on WiFi and a bit slow on Sprint 3G but that's not related to the phone.. My only complaint is when I stream Pandora the phone gets hot after awhile. I expect the battery to die fast but not get hot. Other than that... Great work Apple!
I am an HTC man myself but my wife loves this phone. She has had many, many phones over the years but there was always something that she didn't like about them. This phone she loves. Period. So if you have a picky phone user in your family this is the phone for them. Best part is she can call our daughter on her iPod (as long as my daughter has an internet connection), the iPod works just like the iPhone. Awesome, especially if you feel 14 yrs old is too young for a phone.
My only complaint about the iPhone is that when you are used to the Google turn by turn navigation being so smooth and easy to use on the Android phones, you expect that iPhone to be equal or better... yet, I guess it's Google's way of sticking it to Apple... If the app store would have a decent Navigation app that actually links to Siri, it would be quite lovely...
so far this is the only phone i haven't managed to break as yet. i love, love, love this phone!!
internet is slow on phone dont know if its due to area that I live in
Phone overall is good and takes a bit to get use to. Only major thing I had issues with was sending pictures I get "failure to deliver" and have to resend up to 5 times. I do enjoy being able to explore more apps.
Best phone ever. Seamlessly puts pictures, movies, and music to my iPad. No lag or freezing up like other phones. Simply put it just works.
Just wondering what else they can put in the next phone! Because this phone is Great!!!
I am not into waisting time on phones and this phone made it very fast and easy..
Easy to use n navigate while multi-tasking, great camera w/ the ability to take screen shots, but not as fast as it could be. It ain't slow, but it ain't fast as it could be. Need to get away from 3G n convert to 4G.
The phone is great. You just Can't go wrong with apple. We waited for so long for tmobile to get it but they never did so we moved to sprint. So far so good... I would recommend this phone to all android users. Ppl say that iPhone isn't as customizable as droids. Actually there are thousands of apps that can help you customize your phone. The limit is your imagination and creativity! Think of it as a blank page cuz it comes with only basics and it's up to you to make it what you want it to be. Oh yeah and battery life... Just understand its a SMART phone and it's running hundreds of operations back stage that you don't see and even in stand by. Just carry the stylish charger wherever you go and you will be fine or charge every day.
Love this phone, its just like having a tablet. Fast internet, great apps!
Find it easy to navigate, not really liking SIRI she never understands me but the camera is sweet, and talk texting is fun works great. I really like this phone I have apple products at home so all my electronics are compatible.
I have just recently switched to iPhone and I must say it's so much better than Android. I will never switch back.
The iPhone is the most wonderful phone I have ever owned. I can do just about everything with it that I can do with a computer!
I have been a Palm user for 8 plus years and this is my first phone outside that brand and my only regret is why I waited so long! The ease of use and functionality of the phone is hands down one of the best! I would recommend the iPhone to anybody looking for great quality and huge interfacing capabilities.
After having an Android phone for 2.5 years, I finally went for the 4S when it came to Sprint. Not because I'm an Apple fan, but it does have some excellent qualities. I previously had a Samsung Moment, which had problems from day 1. Benefits of Apple: updates at will, not when Sprint wants you to. Apps work with all versions of iOS. Apps for just about anything The 4S is much better on battery life than my Moment was (more a Samsung issue than Android). I do wish that there was an led to alert you if you missed a call/text. I have mine on my desk most of the day (I'm a teacher, so answering it is not possible) , but would like to be able to see if i missed something. Of course, there are zillions of cases, etc, available. Don't like that everything has to go through iTunes. I miss the zedge app for wallpapers and ringtones. Ringtones are a multistep process with Apple. My gmail and Google calendars sync nicely. All in all, I'm happy, but I would have stayed with Android if I felt that they would support their phones with updates!
The best phone I ever had! I love the "Siri" function the most.
Even though I'm an Apple person, I switched from iPhone 3G to HTC EVO. Now I'm back to 4S. I probably will stay with Apple. Even though Android is an open platform with the ability to return apps, the iPhone is simple. Yeah, the apps are great, but I need a phone that just works.
Wonderful product. We selected the iPhone because we have an iPad and we thought it would be easy to use since we already know our way around the iPad. It is easy to use. Love all the available apps. We've had Sprint service even in out-of-the-way places.
Personally, I think the device itself is five stars, however the 3G sprint network it uses seriously cripples this device. Using the speed test app, I consistently get 0.01 Mbps. This is with great coverage. Anything you download, an app, music, etc, you're better off using wifi. Siri consistently times out on the first try. If you're on sprint and not on wifi, this device is only good for phone calls.
Great phone along with the service I got from the Best But Staff the time of my pick up. Only down fall about it all is when I got my phone Beat Buy had a perk if you got any new phone and service you got a $50.00 Best Buy gift card and everyone played stupid like it wasn't advertised one bit. I leave Apple products and I have never went wrong about getting this iPhone best choice I made
I love it! it'a a great phone to have the data is really fast when downloading on the sprint network!!!
I love my iPhone 4s, but if I had one issue it would be that Siri can be a bit stubborn at times. She worked great at first because I was just sitting on my couch using the wifi, but when I go out and about she doesn't work more often than she does. No major worries though...great phone.
Once I get to know more of what iPhone does, I know I will have the best device for my needs. Being in school right now, I have found many apps to help me. I switched to Mac 2 years ago and finally brought them together with the iPhone. It's great how well they work together. Best thing about it...NO MORE GOOGLE!!!!
There's iPhones, then there's a bunch of phones that want to be iPhones.
Love everything about this phone. Hope apple doesnt come out with the 5 soon or else i will have to upgrade. But this phone and esp Siri ofcourse are amazing and must have for anyone who can afford it.
Apple is a growing company that exceeds in making their products more and more user friendly. This is by far the best iPhone to date and is better than android devices. Having iTunes sync everything I need to my device is really awesome, unlike android phones you have to manually drag and drop files and what not (too much work if you ask me). Getting around on my phone is easy and work 90% flawlessly. Heres the scale (1 - 10) 1 being terrible , 10 being amazing -Phone Call Quality = 10 -Battery = 10 -Apps =7 -Durability=7 -Siri=5 -Camera Video / Picture quality=10 -iPhone on Sprint=7 Now i'll go through the reason's for my ratings. #1 Phone Call Quality Making phone calls to me for my job is really important , and its even more important that I can hear the client well and they can hear me well. Calling people is so clear , even if someone is sick and is barely able to talk , you're still able to pick up what they're saying. #2 Battery The battery is by far the best in the business and I have yet to find another phone (with my kinda usage of music playing and web surfing) that can handle all that and still have power by the end of the day. Most droid phones need an extended battery to do this...which cost more money. Charging the phone from dead to 100% takes around an 1hr 30min. Which is extremely helpful to me and others who use their phones for laptops. #3 Apps Now some may tell you android has tons of free apps, that is a true fact. Here is also another fact YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR! iTunes apps may cost you .99 cents but seriously if your that stingy for some apps you should probably go with a pre-paid phone. iTunes has a very strict policy about their apps so dont worry about some random person making these apps. #4 Durability Ive actually dropped my phone a few times and it has surprisingly been ok. (knocks on wood) I did not have a case on it ether. Dont be fooled into thinking you need a case for your phone. I've had many phones that ive dropped and have been perfectly ok. Some cases can actually ruin your phone when you drop them too. Again this goes back to the theory "You get what you pay for". #5 Siri Siri is a completely cool and new way to experience your phone and text messaging. Having her read your text messages without having to unlock your phone and all that while driving or working is amazing. She also will work with your apple headset. Now heres why she gets a bad rating. Unless you got full bars or you're wifi Siri will not work. She needs constant internet access for everything. She can also type up your messages completely wrong. I told her a few days ago to play a song, she ends up setting me up a calender date for the 12th of next month for 7pm. It really is hit or miss. Thank God she is only in beta...hopefully not forever though. #6 Camera Is amazing!! Best sound quality mixed in with amazing picture quality. Your iPhone will become your new camera. I've actually taken this to concerts and have been able to record decent quality in both sound and video. #7Sprint Ive been with almost every cell phone company you have imagined along with even ones you haven't heard of. I've also had more then over 50 phones 23 of those are droids. I can tell you by experience that sprint is so far the best company for your iPhone. Verizon is way to expensive, yes I get service almost everywhere (except my house -_- ) Sprint is very affordable and offers alot more customer service than I've seen from *cough cough* AT&T. Honestly this is a good phone and even without sprint it still is an amazing phone and is 100% the best thing you could ever had. Hope this helps you or who ever is looking to get a good quality phone.
This is a great phone, I have had it just over a month and have not had any major issues with it thus far.
My phone was not and still not is working at its full capability. I spent hours on the phone with Sprint and Apple trying to get my phone to connect with wi-fi. First, I had no bars in my home so Sprint sent me an airave device. The device worked until my internet service was delayed and then ceased to function. So my internet needs to be working in order for myphone to work in my own home. The device I wasstill using my data instead of my wi-fi. So it was a good thing I went with Sprint's unlimited data. However there are a number of operations that cannot function without wi-fi. One trip to the Apple store they reconfigured everything (which I had done a number of times with both Sprint and Apple on the phone). I was told to come back to get a new phone if that didn't help me connect to wi-fi. The following day with a failed wi-fi connection I went back to Apple where they questioned my router settings (I had already spent time to update my router which was recommended by an Apple rep via phone). After hours of being in contact with Apple reps, that was the first I heard of preferred wi-fi "channels" for my router. They exchanged my phone nonetheless and said that I may have to get in contact with my router customer service rep. I called Netgear to hear that apparently there is something wrong with the settings on my computer. It will cost $200 at least to fix what bug seems to block my Apple 4$ from connecting to wi-fi. And did I mention that my laptop connects fine to my router's wi-fi? It has been an exhausting road. I have changed my signature to add the following, "Sent from my iphone....if all technology is working harmoniously".
Great Product! Siri is a Great Addition and will only grow and get better! Sleek Design and Full of Everything you want or need! The ONLY Device you need to carry!
Bought as a Christmas gift for my fiancee because Korean is her first language and this is one of the few phones you don't have to jail break to get full Korean language support. Comfortable size, lots of features and downloadable applications, excellent build quality. Feels expensive. Is only offered in 3G but our local 4G coverage isn't that great anyway (No, the 4 in the name does not mean 4G). Hands free that comes with phone is top notch. Fiancee likes it and actually uses many of the smart phone technologies on it unlike her previous smart phones. That said, she prefers my Samsung Galaxy S2 for screen size and call quality, but I'm not giving it to her. :) Monthly insurance on this phone is over twice what I paid for any other phone, and if you don't get insurance it costs more to replace than nearly any phone on the market. That said, when you are done with it, there is an actual aftermarket that you can sell it on, unlike most of my old phones that are in a landfill or that I got five dollars in credit for.
Love this phone, it's fast, unlike my Evo, it actually responds to my touch, I don't have to double tap the screen to get it to do what I want it to do. It takes great pics and video. The apps actually work very smooth. I have to say that there's no lag at all, in fact I'm writing this review from it lol. Buttom line, if u have an Android switch, u won't regret it, it won't freeze on u and u won't have to reset to factory. Great phone!
This the best phone I have ever had. I love it. My only complaint is that siri could be smarter. Maybe it will get better with time and updates. Other than that this phone is everything I expected it to be and then some.
I bought this phone as a gift for my daughter and she loves it!
The 4s has had its ups and its downs in the media. Any of the downs however haven't surfaced with my phone. There are some unique things with Siri, but, not anything to really complain about. I am glad that Sprint finally got into the iPhone business.
This phone is awesome and easily took the place of my blackberry. I would definitely recommend this to anyone. The Sprint service on it is great also.
So far, I like he phone. My only complaint is the battery life is horrible.
Not a huge Apple fan, but this phone seems to be pretty good.
Who wouldn't love this phone? This phone is user friendly & works pretty fast not like an android. My 4 year old has mastered the use of this phone - crazy! I will never own another phone again unless apple makes something even better - how could that be???? Anyway the cost was hard to get passed but once I got the phone it was so worth the money - makes life easier. I was going to get a laptop in the next year I think this phone has convinced me I would rather have an ipad!Highly recommend Defender series otter box for protection!
I was excited when i first got my iphone 4s. But when i started using it, the internet speed was super slow. And i've heard the same from so many other people about sprint. The customer support is not so good either. They tend to be rude so i'm pretty much done with this company. Just a heads up for those looking to sign up with them. I do not reccomend sprint at all.
Siri is awesome! I am a sales rep and do a lot of driving. I am able to do emails and texts faster and safer with Siri. I just tell her to send it for me. Finding locations is faster and better than ever, as I just ask Siri. She is just amazing!!!! Can't wait to see what other stuff that Apple can come up with.
The iPhone 4S is a great phone, simple to use, good looking (fragile) and iOS is silky smooth. The main setbacks are the small screen (should be 4"), 3G data limitation and the radio isn't optimized for use on Sprints network (fist iPhone available for the carrier).
Quality is great and durability is good. Sound clarity is awesome. battery life is moderate. Quality is great and durability is good. Sound clarity is awesome. battery life is moderate Quality is great and durability is good. Sound clarity is awesome. battery life is moderate
I love using Siri, when my network coverage is great. I wish my batterly life was better, considering all I do is use the internet, text, & make a few calls. I was a big fan of the BlackBerry, and miss a few things, like BlackBerry Messenger.
I like the new iPhone 4S but find that I prefer a larger screen and that it is not as intuitive with some functions as is my old Android cell phone. The nice thing about the iPhone 4S is Seri with voice commands and the fact that I can sync information on my phone with my Apple computers with relative ease.
I love this phone! This is the best smartphone I've ever had. I had bought an 3GS for my daughter and myself last week and found out it was very slow and sometimes it even dropped lots of calls! Though my daughter is fine with the phone but I am not. I ended up returning the phone and getting an iPhone 4S instead. It works perfectly and fast and in my condition, it never dropped a single call. For people updating from 4, hold on and wait for 5! But if you're on a 3 (or lower) or 3GS, update to 4S because it is completely worth it.
I was one of the lucky ones to first get the Iphone 4s from Sprint however I must say that I was not impressed with this phone. After several days of poor battery life and not so great call quality, I returned the phone. After looking at several phones I ended up with my first Android phone, the Galaxy S2 Epic Touch. I have to be honest and say that my I phone felt outdated after using the Epic Touch for a few days. My battery issue is gone, the phone is really smooth, love the huge screen, camera and the call quality is top notch. I guess I got caught up in the I Phone hype. Do yourself and big favor and try the Samsung Galaxy Epic Touch if you are on Sprint, if you are like me, you will be amazed at what this phone can do.
The iPhone 4s uses the tried and true formula of the iPhone 4 which is both a good and a bad thing. Those with a 3Gs or lower I would tell to upgrade but iPhone 4 owners should save their money. It preforms slightly better than the 4 but it is hardly noticeable. The only significant difference comes with Siri which in my opinion is more or less a novelty feature and not worth the money. The 4s is by no means a bad phone, its just not quite what it should've been.
This is my first IPhone. My wife has the IPhone 4. I fell in love with her phone. Verizon service is the best although expensive. I had the Droid X but it CONSTANTLY crashed especially when using Google Navigation App. The only app the IPhone really needs to add is a similar but better App that the Android has (Google Navigation). Don't pay for VZ Navigator. It is not worth it. Map Quest has a decent free app on the IPhone. The phone is FAST and the personal assistant is "Geeky" but VERY cool. Buy this and get rid of your IPod Touch. No need for it any more.. Get the Smuge Proof Zagg Screen Saver! Let Best Buy Install It LIFETIME Waranty!
I am on my 3rd iphone with the same problems. I cannot answer the phone! The agent at the Apple store told me this is an issue that I will always have and it is common across every model they have including the 4s. Several times each week when my phone rings I am unable to slide the indicator on the screen to answer the phone, nor can I push the slider to unlock the phone. The official Apple answer is to just call the person back! Not possible if the person is calling from a location with a switchboard such as a hospital or your child's school. How would you like to miss one of those important calls? I am disappointed that a premium priced phone is less reliable than one of those $20.00 throw away phones.
This is the best phone I have ever had. I've been patiently waiting for Sprint to get the iPhone and I'm so happy they finally did. I have the unlimited data plan and I can say it is very worth it. I just upgraded from a blackberry tour 9650, what an upgrade. The touch screen is amazing, it is super fast, the browser is super fast, netflix and youtube stream perfectly. The battery life is decent. If you only use it for calling, texting, and e-mail it lasts a very long time, but if you are constantly surfing the web or playing apps you will notice the battery drain. I;m getting such good reception with this phone, much better than with my blackberry. To save the best for last SIRI. Siri is great I can now respond to text messages while driving safely. She understands everything I say clearly. Great phone!!! I don't think I'll ever own another phone other than an iPhone!
Had the very first iPhone, was due for an upgrade. Glad I waited for this latest model. Couldn't be happier with the new features and the way you can now customize some of these things. Worth the wait.
SIRI, SIRI, SIRI WHAT A AMAZING FEATURE. APPLE HIT A HOME RUN WITH THIS. BASICALLY GOOGLE SEARCH BUT WAY BETTER AND IT ACTUALLY UNDERSTANDS WHAT YOUR SAYING. IT ALSO HAS A SENSE OF HUMOR, WHEN YOU GET ONE TELL IT, I LOVE YOU, AND I NEED TO HIDE A BODY AND LISTEN TO THE GREAT RESPONSES. GOT MINE ALREADY AND GETTING MY OTHER EVO AND EPIC SWAPPED TO IPHONES ALSO. I SEE WHY THE HYPE IS SO BIG. QUAILTY ALL THE WAY AND THE BATTERY DOESNT DIE IN 12 MINUTES LIKE THE EVOS. YEA I HAVE THE EXTENDED BATTERY AND IT WORKS BUT NOW MY EVO IS 792 LBS. TOUCH PAD WORKS GREAT. MY ONLY WISH IS A LIL BIGGER SCREEN.
I went from Iphone 4 w/ IOS 5 to the Iphone 4s just today. I must say im not impressed. Siri is a cool idea but not very dependable. I kept getting the server is unavailable. Im not sure why?? I think it maybe that everyone picked up SIRI like a bad habit. The good is the HD video and high quality pic, very cool!! I notice a little bit of increased navigating websites. I believe this is the new A5 chip. My biggest complaint and most likely reason ill take back the iphone 4s is the battery life. In two hours, I went from 100% battery to 75%, ouch! This was w/ moderate usage: I read 4-5 webpages, checked my facebook/yearbook three times, read 5 emails, ran itunes for 30 mins, and accessed SIRI 6 times. That's 25% loss in two hours. It is much more noticeable then my Iphone 4 was. I read some online articles and they say standby time is 100 hours less than Iphone 4. They believe it may be because of A5 processor or SIRI feature. It's not the IOS 5 because my IPHONE 4 was good! Good Luck!!!
I love my new iPhone 4S. It has everything I need! I have my email, music, internet and of course phone services and a great data plan through Sprint. Only problem is that Sprint has shotty service in my area and I get dropped calls and other phone quality issues. Otherwise when I'm anywhere other than home, I have the best phone ever! I will never go Android again!
Love the iPhone - still working on learning all the features and figuring out iTunes - every time I try to use songs I lose my ring tones????? Since I have over 250G of songs on the computer it tries to put ALL of them on the phone and I can't figure how to just put about 100 songs on it. When I "sync" it I end up losing all my ringtones???? But, I will figure it out. Love the way it works so much better than my Blackberry.
This is a great product easy to use. It looks elegant. It has a good price, good camera quality, etc.
Overall, it is excellent in almost all aspects; my son couldn't be happier at the way the phone integrates with our Mac computer, his IPAD and his Iphone.
All in all this is a great device. It is so much more than a phone. Actually I use it as a phone less than for other things. There's an app for everything, the music and video quality are outstanding and the pictures are remarkable. I'd be lost without my iPhone.
BUY THIS PHONE!!! I had the best experience at Best Buy. The employees were so helpful in helping me pick the right phone. I have never had an iPhone, but now I am totally sold and will never have another phone if its not an iPhone.
I love my phone it's by far the best phone I have bought
This is an awesome phone. I had a LG optimus for the past two years. There is no comparison. I can even get a signal out in the northwestern part of Illinois with Sprint. I am extremely happy with my iphone.
Awesome phone just make sure you get a portable battery charger. Definetely worth buying it. I had it for two months now.
Bought this for my new iPhone 4s. I had an original invisible shield for my 3G and didn't particularly like it, it darkened the screen and made it feel very tacky, so I was skeptical in getting this one. One of the mobile employees recommended this full body screen protector, I didn't mind the price as I had a gift card, so I figured why not try it out. I had it installed by the employees, which I would highly recommend, they are excellent at applying them as 2 days later, there are no bubbles on the screen. As for the actual screen protector, if it wasn't for the fact that I can see its outline around the speaker and cameras, I wouldn't be able to tell there was one even on it. It is silky smooth and doesn't diminish the color of the screen whatsoever. Ad with Zagg's lifetime warranty, I think it'll be well worth the money.
This screen protector for the iPhone is great. It makes your device even better, and you can have peace at mind knowing your iPhone is in good care. It was a little scary putting it on but it went great.
Great sleek cover I like to have my phone in my pocket so couldn't have a huge bulky cover. Had the employee at Best Buy Mobile install it onto my new iPhone, she did a great job, and it only cost $12 to have her do it and took about 10 minutes. Thanks for a great cover and great customer service. The cover can't tell it is on the phone and works well with no glare. Would definitely recommend the HD version of this cover vs the standard cover, just based on the fact of the reduced glare. I believe they are the same price or very close in price. Overall very pleased and happy with the product.
First of all, I might not be a typical reviewer. I have been using Zagg invisible shield products for over three years now. I am very adept to installing this stuff. Zaggs are not cheap and if you mess up an installation, that's a lot of money down the drain and I am sure proceeding reviews will talk about this. My review will not touch on installation, just the quality of the product. As I mentioned, I have been a Zagg user for three years. This is the best one I have seen. When I bought it, I assumed the "HD" stamp was just another marketing scheme. I simply needed a new protector for a new phone. After installing it, I could not believe my eyes. It's really a lot clearer and touching it is like touching glass. I showed it to a few friends and they could not believe that there was a screen protector on my phone. Yes! I actually went around to show of a screen protector. That's how good this thing is.
This was a gift and my friend is super satisfied and loves the case.
in response to the first review about the color fading, just a couple of things i can think of. Either your wearing Cheap pants and the color was running, or you just need to clean your pockets. I've had the white one and its been perfect! no issues with fading whatso ever. its a perfect fit, apple designed so it has to be very good. perfect protection, and unlike all the bulky "iphone cases", this one prevents your phone from scratches cuz it elevates ur iphone and protects it from impact. not only that, it doesn't hide the look and distinct features of the iphone.my favorite part is how you can actually see the whole phone, that expensive iphone look and everything.
After just one day of normal "pocketure" in my jeans and suit pants, the bumper became discolored. Get the black if you have a black iPhone, but maybe a clear/translucent if you have the white iPhone like I do.
The cover is super snug & cute. Would recommend this cover to anyone.
This case looks and feels awesome, and I get many compliments on it. However - like several cases of this design, the fabric is just glued to the plastic frame, and is coming apart from the case. I've had 2 other similar cases and they all do the same thing - poor design. Also, surprisingly the stitching which holds the red rubber swtch on the back and edges is wearing, so the red rubber is starting to come off. I'd expect more from a $30 case, especially given it's only 3 months old.
Great case. Fits better than a glove. Looks like the device could have had it come from Apple it was made to fit so well. Very durable with the work I do. Primarily used for when I'm on the job. Feels so good in hand as well. Slides in & out of pocket with ease. Feels better than an OtterBox. Love how the design has the speakers facing towards you. I will be buying another for my other iPhone for my partner. Customer for life!
Only problem I have one problem. I have a vertical belt holder and sometimes when I pull the phone out of the holster, the Mophie juice Box top comes off. They could try to make it stay connected a little better on the next modification.
I picked this case because it was one of the cheapest as well as one of the thinnest ones I could find. I've dropped my phone twice that I can remember and it has protected it extremely well. Its easy to get the phone in and out of it (which I did a lot of when I first got my iPhone to show it off to people).
If you want a slim lightweight case with minimalist design this is an excellent choice. The case edges do not project above the plane of the screen so a dropped phone which lands face first is not protected
I bought this case at the end of October. It is a very slim, nice looking case but after having the case for less than 6 weeks, it is already cracking and breaking. I have never dropped my phone so I'm not sure I what has caused this to happen. This is a poor quality case and I would not recommend buying it.
This case is very thin, which make it less bulky if you tend to carry your iphone in your pockets. Other than that, not sure how well it would hold up if you were to drop your iPhone. The case doesn't wrap around the entire face of the iPhone, only the corners. So if you drop it on the face or onto something directly on the side, your iPhone might get damaged. The silver case looks very nice, especially with a white iPhone. For what you pay, the value is okay, but what you're paying for for this case is a lightweight, slim, aesthetically pleasing silver case. If that's what you're looking for, I'd recommend it. If you're looking for more protection than looks, don't get this.
I'm not sure why this has bad ratings. I have had several slider cases and snug cases and this one is the best so far. I like the design and really like how the bottom and top of the case are cut out a bit. this allows for head phones and aux cables to fit freely. My last slider case had to be removed in order to use the non-apple headphones I liked. I like the metal inlay as well and does a nice job sliding in and out of your pocket.
More resistent than plastic but still not a good price
Cons: The aluminum inlay blocks the iPhone's already fragile antenna and causes a poor voice reception and off and on 3G connectivity. Pros: The case stays on and in place. It is tough to get off but that is a plus for a case. It's smooth and sleek and feels really good. Unfortunately I am returning it later today. I have to have reception on my phone. It's what I bought it for. Next time I will buy an all plastic or rubber case, no more metal ones even if it is just an aluminum inlay. It played hell with the reception.
Its a good looking case but its really hard to take the phone out of it once its in
Works ok but it doesn't quite fit the 4S. It appears to not be wide enough on the back and so one side seems to be always about to pop off. Otherwise it works fine just not happy with fit.
I purchased this case a few months back. I was really pleased with it for the first few days.The colors were vibrant and it seemed very durable. Emphasis on SEEMED. Within two weeks the fabric looked filthy and disgusting--there's no easy way to clean it. The fabric also began to fray at the bottom corners and peel off all together. In less than a month the top left corner of the case was deformed and didn't hug the phone or the corner of the screen anymore. I'm typically very careful with my phone and I have had an iPhone for over two years without any cracked or even scratched screens. The phone fell off my lap and fell onto a concrete floor [MAYBE a distance of a foot and a half]. Because the left corner wasn't protected well anymore the screen in that corner was shattered and also caused a large crack down the left side of my phone screen. Had a better case been on it my screen would not be cracked! I contacted Speck to complain because I felt the case was defective. They simply told me if I sent back the case with the receipt they would replace the case. Obviously, I do not want another Speck case. I feel their name is vastly overrated and they're extremely overpriced. I will NEVER purchase another product of theirs--and I'll never recommend them to anyone.
Didn't realize that it does not include headphone clip on band that other color of same style includes at equal price. Also would be great if touchscreen window was a hair wider, case overlaps enough to just barely block last couple millimeters when trying to do the unlock phone swipe.
Works as expected -- note that if you use a "plastic" type screen protector it will get "stuck" and not easily be removed from the holder. My protector was wearing out so I took it off and it works fine.
So I don't know if I just got unlucky with this case, but my experience with this is horrible. I always use my iphone for working out and the thing about this case is that is does not stay on my arm. Whatever I do, it always starts coming down my arm, especially when I am running and I have to keep stopping and adjusting my arm strap. It sucks! I have not yet found a case that I am satisfied with..
This is a great case for someone who needs to set their phone on a slick surface and have it stay in place. It's only downfall is that it traps dirt, and needs to be removed and washed with dish soap daily.
I like the way it feels and would recommend it to a friend!
If you are going to put your phone in the hands of an 18 month old, I recommend this cover. However, it will take time to learn to deal with the deeply recessed buttons. Also if you carry your phone in your jeans/pants pocket it tends to pull everything out with it. This is because of the friction between the rubber cover and whatever is in your pockets. So there you go, great protection but you have to put up with bulk, friction, and slightly more difficult reach buttons.
Overall, it's a great iPhone cover, and I say that with conviction, as it's the only one i've ever owned.
product was too flimsy and didnt fit very snug on my I-phone. although some liked it and recommened it to me. It just wasn't what I expected
Overall this case works quite well. It's easy to grip, even when wet and protects the phone from accidental drops. The only issue is the difficulty of connecting the cable for syncing or charging. The cut out for the cable connector is a bit smalll and must be manipulated to connect a cable. I found that removing the case from the phone is required. It's a small issue but could have been avoided by design.
Overall I was not impressed with this item. Although it is rigid and seems to provide ample protection, and it comes with a screen protector film, to me it wasn't good enough. The bottom piece that slides on wouldn't stay put. When pulling it out of my pocket, I would either just pull it off, or the bottom piece would get left behind in my pocket. Also, this case has such sharp edges that it wouldn't fit in my car holder. I am not sure if the bottom falling off was a design flaw, or maybe just a flaw with the particular one I purchased. Be sure to check it out before purchasing. I ended up taking it back and bought the Belkin Essential 050 case. Much happier.
I will be returning my lifeproof case I purchased today! I'm not impressed with the screen protection anything could easy put a hole or a rip in it. I feel if you dropped this case with your phone in it in the water and it hit a rock or hard sufface it would pop open and then you could say bye bye to your phone. I would buy a underwater camera/video camera before buying this and spend more money then spending $79.99 on this and losing $199.99 on your iphone. I hope this helps dont buy this product is review is from a person that want protection!!!!
I tested my case as mentioned in the directions for leaks, and it worked perfectly. I was able to use my phone under water multiple times. I swam with it in the lake, filmed Tarpon at the dock under water in the Keys, swam with it offshore; however, on a swim in waist deep water at the beach a very small amount of moisture leaked into the case. The result was an iPhone that doesn't turn off, the front camera doesn't focus, and accelerated battery usage. The very small water droplets were able to bypass the membrane near the earpiece speaker. I did check the condition and security of the case before entering the water. Each water use was limited to no more than 5 feet. A quote from lifeproof.com ~ "LifeProof warranty does not, under any circumstance, cover the replacement or cost of any electronic device or personal property inside or outside of the case. " I write this review as a caution to you. The case will work as advertised a majority of the time, but I would be careful in using it as a primary underwater camera like I did. I should have used my cheap Fuji for that. Good luck.
This is my first iPhone and after seeing a demonstration of an iPhone sitting in a bowl of water for 15 minutes coming out fully functional and DRY I decided to spend the money. A bonus is that I wouldn't need to purchase an expensive ZAGG screen and body protector, a $30 savings! Lifeproof admonishes new users to NOT use a screen protector for the reasons listed on their website www.lifeproof.com/support. On their website you will have the opportunity to upgrade your warranty to 1 year for FREE by taking a simple quiz on the product. The good thing is that while fishing the other day my phone must have fallen out of my tackle box because I saw it laying at the waters edge covered in mud and most definitely submerged. NO DAMAGE! The phone was bone dry and fully functional. NICE! The NOT SO GOOD THING is that you are not warned that your standard charging/data cable will not work with the case, and you must purchase an adapter, or remove the case (not recommended) every time you want to charge or sync your phone. At the price charged they could have been more forthcoming or even better, provided the adapter FREE OF CHARGE. Accessories are over priced, so do some shopping for the best deals ... Hope this helped a little ... paul
This cover did not work!!! My son dropped his iPhone in the pool and it is ruined!!! I contacted the company and the only thing they will do id replace the cover!!! So he is going to have to pay 500 dollars to replace his iPhone. Maybe this product works most of the time and he just had a defective one but don't pay 80 bucks for something that may not even work and for sure you should not trust that it will!!!!
if your thinking about getting one, don't think about it just buy one. Trust me I had my phone no more then 4 hours and it fell in the pool and this thing saved my phone.
This is super protective but the sacrifices are major: you can't plug in earphones and the cover blocks the sound. It also adds substantial weight and bulk to what was a sleek phone.
Case works great and is comfortable. It seems to do what is most important - keep the water away. It will definitely help with a longer life. Worth the money. If you are thinking of buying a screen protector and case, this case does both (better) and for the same price or less. Get it.
I think any customer should expect something that lives up to promises made when a phone case costs $86.49 after taxes. I didn't purchase to take underwater photos, I just wanted to protect my phone as I have a habit of dropping and spilling. Unfortunately, this case is of poor quality. The membrane that "protects" the ear speaker is just about the flimsiest piece of junk I've ever seen. Not only that, there is absolutely no warning about this. Mine developed a small hole and now that hole allows water or dust or whatever right throught the case. The best part is that Lifeproof will not do anything for me since I "must have damaged the equipment." Right, I have nothing better to do than purposely damage a $90 phone case and then try to get anyone to act honorably towards a paying customer. GARBAGE.
After trashing several Otterbox's I decided to step it up a notch and get a tougher iphone case. After lots of research I decided the Lifeproof was the phone case for me since I work in AG and deal with dust, water, drops, bumps and accidents on a daily basis. I first fell in love the case and thought I had a case that would finally last more than two weeks. Wrong. The first case lasted exactly 43 days before the charging port broke shortly after a pin hole appeared in the speaker cover, allowing dust to get into the case. I purchased a second and tested it just as required for waterproofness and it lasted somewhere around two months before yet another hole appeared allowing more dust into the case. Then to top it off just today it fell out of my truck into dirt and cracked the screen on my phone. I will never buy another one and if you work outside more than a few hours a day then dont waste your time or money.
We bought this case for the iPhone 4s for it's waterproofing capabilities as my husband fishes a lot. However, today he left the phone on the hood of my Explorer and low and behold it fell off and he ran over it. He hear the crunch and thought the worst. At first glance, it seemed as though the phone was trashed. The plastic screen protecter had holes in it from the rocks on the road. However, after removing the case the iPhone did not have one scratch on it. We will definitely be getting another one. Apparently it protects the phone from impact as well as water. Great case!
Love the new colors and really works. Dropped by phone in sink on mistake and zero damage
I used the cover for an offshore fishing trip and I loved it. My phone worked like a charm, able to use touch screen without difficulty but the volume was a liitle muffled other than that loved it
I purchased and had the LifeProof case on my iPhone 4 for about 3 weeks, and it's going back today. The case is extremely durable (shockproof) and was, in my experience, 100% waterproof. Actually took video underwater in my friends pool and was tossing it in the pool while the video was shooting and letting the younger kids dive down to retrieve it. You really have to be careful putting the case on your phone to make sure that it's completely snapped into place and that the yellow o-ring that surrounds the phone is in the proper channel......after you do that, it's 100%. Humidity does put some moisture inside the case, and the case screen can stick to the phone screen. However durable, the day to day with this case is completely annoying. To use the headphone port, you have to carry around their adapter that screws into the case. Forget that adapter and you can forget using your headphone port, too, without taking the case completely off. Also, the charging port is sealed, but in order to achieve this, the plastic that surrounds it was designed to such tight tolerances that only the Apple cord that came with the phone is small enough to fit into it. If you like to use and aftermarket cord or any device with an iPhone base......again, forget it. It won't fit. I even purchased extension cords from an aftermarket source to relieve the base issue, and the heads were too big for the LifeProof case. Because of this, the case rendered all other cords and bases useless, including my vehicle charger and made it a requirement to carry an Apple specific cord in order to charge/transfer the phone. Buy more cords, you say. . . . . ? Not for $28 a piece for the Apple brand cords. All in all, if you are a ritual beach goer that needs day to day protection from things like sand and water, and your desire is to shoot underwater video with your iPhone.....have at it, this is the case for you. If you want to do anything else with it. . . . .forget it.
After all the rave reviews about the development budget used to produce the Lifeproof case and all the wonderful things it can protect your phone from I spent the extra $$$ over like cases. Wrong answer, charging port door which does not allow anything other than the stock charging cable to be inserted into it has broken in little over a month. The included headphone adapter which is required if you want to use anything other than the stock apple headphones is so poorly made it fails after 2 weeks of use, I'm on my second adapter already. The headphone port is protected by a little screw in cap that can be placed in a little plastic holder while headphones are being used. DO NOT USE THE INCLUDED HOLDER it will fall off your headphones before you can say "what the ...". The case has great potential and I really want it to work, unfortunately there were major quality control issues not addressed in production and I fear the company is in some serious trouble if too many people are requiring as many warranty replacements as I am. I'm guessing they are facing major issues as their service department takes ages to respond to issues via email and are near impossible to reach at their support phone line.
I've used a lot of cases for my iPhone 4S by Otterbox, Incase, Sena and Speck but Lifeproof is the best. This is the only case that is light and thin but covers 100% of the area around the device. My only negative is that at $80.00 it should include the belt clip, which is currently a separate $30.00 purchase.
This product is about as "lifeproof" as a piece of paper. For one i wasted my money and $80 is way overpriced. Also it only lasted me 4 days before it completely ruined my iphone. This is because after following all the proceduers and checking the seal the seal faile and let water in my iphone. And guess what they wont give me the money for a new one even though it is guranteed water proof. Dont buy because if your phone breaks you are out of luck. Sincerely, Angry customer
So far so good, I have not dropped it yet. The sales associate did throw his across the floor (wood) and his phone was fine. If it protects that well I'll be happy.
Overall very good case. Would be more useful if it had a built in extended battery.
I have considered replacing it with a standard case but will probably not do so.
I absolutely love my case. I daringly tested it in the Guadeloupe River yesterday and it worked splendidly. It was very light to carry, but I would have loved to have a lanyard slot. I was able to talk on the phone as well while floating the river. The picture quality was great because of the iPhone camera, but the case doesn't hold on to the beads of water as much meaning less water spots. I love the case too because I can accidentally drop it in the sink or on the ground, and not have to cry about it. Granted I haven't done anything like run it over with a car, but realistically I'd pay $80 to protect a $600 phone that has a limited protection warranty. Now I don't have to worry about shattered glass or water damage. This is also an awesome investment if you tend to sweat a lot because it protects the speaker from water (hence waterproof * up to 6.5 ft.) Totally worth the money, and I like that the screen isn't too crazy different. It does have a little difference in the feel of the touch screen, but it wasn't like how my Griffen Survior Case was. I could text the same and hear the same out of the phone.
Well, I have been using it all week on my vacation in Punta Cana, but all of the sudden I went to take a picture and the shots where coming out cloudy..... basically, the phone did not get "wet" but somehow moisture got into the phone and now there are little droplets of water inside by the rear camera..... I really hope this does not effect my warranty, but Lifeproof will be hearing from me about this. I do admit it works and the phone did not get flooded, but this moisture issue concerns me.
I like the case as I am outdoors a lot however, with the lifebox on my phone, it created a horrible echo on the other end of the conversation. regardless of me initiating the call or the call coming in and regardless of who it was there was an echo on their end of the conversation. I attempted a remedy provided by the lifebox website which seemed to make the situation worse. I had to go with an otterbox. It is not completely waterproof but there is no echo for those at the other end of my conversations
You figure for $80.00 you would get something that beats an Otterbox. Not true! Once I took this item out of the box I couldn't believe they charge this much money. You can instantly tell that this thing wouldn't survive a drop, it is thin plastic with 0 scratch protection. The back of the case has fins that will most definitely damage your phone after prolonged use. The plastic screen on the front just looks horrible, a shiny piece of plastic with bumps in it. You cannot use most 3rd party power adapters as it will not fit, and forget about placing in in any type of cradle device. I bought this thinking it would be great to have when I kayak, I am returning and using a sturdy case and a waterproof bag from now on. They should be ashamed for charging so much.
My first iPhone 4s ended up in a wash. So I got this case for the second 4s. I haven't had the guts to test the waterproof ability with the phone but it did past the recommend hour long pre-phone insert test. My gripe is that sound now gets distorted if the ringer/volume is up too high. It kind of sounds like a blown speaker since the thin film of plastic (screen) on the front vibrates. The case (which the manufacturer touts as an 'amplifier') does amplify but the sound gets muddy. It's a small price to pay for the protection.
1 - I did not do the water test, simply because I did not believe that it would survive and did not want a damaged phone on day one. 2 - I did have to shave my Verizon car charger down to fit inside the case opening. Off-brand chargers fit but the Verizon was too large to fit in the opening. 3 - DO NOT DROP YOUR PHONE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 4 - DO NOT DROP YOUR PHONE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 5 - DO NOT DROP YOUR PHONE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! THIS CASE WILL NOT STOP YOUR PHONE FROM SHATTERING WHEN YOU DROP IT FROM PASSING IT FROM ONE PERSON TO ANOTHER AT AROUND 3-1/2 - 4 FEET HIGH. It may say "Shock" proof but maybe they meant bump proof. Just don't bump it off of your table... After spending way too much for this case, I am left with a repair bill and a piece of junk case that I will not recommend to anyone. This is not all LifeProof's fault... but no one from there will pay to fix my phone that broke in their case either... Recommendations.... take your pick, I do not think any case will stop a phone with glass on the front and back from shattering when dropped, even from a low height. Good Luck!!!!
Here I was so stoked about getting this case!! Well, thank goodness for the water test!! Put case together as directed did the water test. And when I was done it was wet on the inside of the screen. How disappointing! Will be getting refund in the am!!
I recently purchased my first iPhone. Having a toddler at home, I was concerned about protecting the phone. Life proof claims to protect against Water, dirt, snow and shock. Priced above all the rest, and with claims above the others, I purchased it. My assumption that it was the best was quickly proven wrong. After carefully reading the instructions, conducting the water proof test and assembling it exactly as it stated, I was excited with this new case. It looked great. After having it for 3 days...that's right, only 3 days... I dropped my phone. I wasn't kayaking down a river or hiking a mountain, just walking down the hallway at the hospital. It slipped out of my hands and the piece covering the power source busted off and went flying. What a piece of junk! Thankfully, this happened within the first 30 days and Best Buy returned it without hassle. Lesson learned...high price doesn't always mean high quality!
I purchased the Lifeproof case for my son's Iphone that he got for Christmas. We watched the tutorials and took the test required to activate the 365 day warranty on Lifeproof's website. My son did exactly what one of the demos shows you can do and video taped underwater. His iPhone no longer works. Best Buy will not refund $$ because I am 12 days past their 30 day return policy. Lifeproof will not refund my money because I didn't buy it from them. Lifeproof will replace the case. Yippee!! I don't have anything to use the case with since their stupid product didn't protect it!! So now we are out the $80 to purchase the case and the cost of the iPhone. I would never recommend this product to anyone!
I love the case for the waterproof aspect, and it seems to be somewhat protected from minor drops. However, the buttons are stiff and take two hands to power down and to switch from sound to vibrate (or back again). The design of the hinge over the port plug area doesn't allow the phone to sit in a docking station, making it unusable if you wish to have it sit in a portable speaker system or car dock. The ear bud plug is also too narrow for my car's tape player adapter too, so the phone can't be used for music while I drive.
The bad part is that the holster will scratch the mess out of the Case screen. Also you have to use the small apple charger to charge your phone, and lastly if you like to plug a AUX or headphone cable into your iPhone in the car or the gym you have to have the headphone screw adapter to listen to music. I got this case when I first purchased my phone and it sounded awesome, and it is. I work in a industrial mill, so a lot of rush and water, nothing penetrated the case to the phone. So that all is great.
I had purchased this case when I first got a 4s but returned it because I thought it was kind of big, not wide like the otter defender, but taller than the phone. I also wasn't as in to fishing as I am now, so thought the inconvenience for having a water-proof phone was not worth it. I returned it and got a HD screen protector and a couple of other cases. I went fly fishing the other day and had my phone(with otter defender case) in my jeans pocket underneath my waders. I took a misstep and fell causing the waders to become anchors. Surprisingly, the phone was ok...... some condensation in the camera lens but thats about it. Thats when I decided that I need to give this case another try. With such an expensive phone it makes sense to spend the money on an almost bulletproof case instead of spending 6 times the amount on a new iphone when you drop yours in the water.
I placed a facial tissue in the closed case and kept the case under water overnight just to see--and the tissue was dry! So then I put my phone in it, but I didn't test it. ;) It does make your iPhone a bit longer, but it still fits in the places I need to, to carry it around. Bummer that I can't just place this on my docking station/speakers, or charge with a non-Apple cable, but hey, when you've dumped two iPhones in water in 1 month, you decide it's time to get a waterproof case. Touch screen accessibility is fine, speakerphone is fine. Have to push a bit to use the power button at the top, but I'm getting used to that. If you're looking for a waterproof case to take your iPhone with you around water--this is a great case! Sleek, waterproof, and the phone is usable just like you would with most any other case.
I purchased this case and the special screw in head phone connector and the special waterproof headphones. I jumped into the pool and immediately noticed that the phone was acting up. I got out and opened the case to some water. At the bottom one of the speaker screens had popped open and allowed water in to ruin my phone. LIFEPROOF does NOT warranty the electronics incased by their product. I am out of luck for their faulty case. DO NOT BUY THIS CASE
I love this case. I have taken it on different trips, even into the river. I love taking photos underwater. I never have to worry if it's raining. Or if my phone falls on the ground, I don't care. It just keeps going.
I like this case, but some of my accessories I already owned for my iPod Touch that I wanted to use with my iPhone do not work with it.
I've had water damage in the past and did not want to waste anymore money. So I purchased the LifeProof case. It is a bit expensive, but worth the money. I was quite surprised that it did not make the phone much bigger and the screen works great. I now have total confidence that I will not ruin my iphone, either from water or dropping it. No more scratches ruining the screen either. Only draw back is that you need an adapter to use earbuds and you must use an apple charger or purchase an adapter. Small set back for big benefits.
The case is well constructed and very small relative to the phone. So my small phone remains relatively small, as opposed to getting an Otterbox which seems to make it 25% larger. My biggest issue is that the case is watertight and so the charging port is covered and the opening is designed for a apple connector. My aftermarket auto charger won't fit. It also won't sit on my clock radio because of the port cover. To make this work you need to spend another $20 or so for a special adaptor. You can't leave it in or its not watertight any more. So this is a piece I now need to carry to the car, or home. Or you can buy a few of them @ $20 ea. Alternatively you can ditch the aftermarket chargers and purchase all Apple products.
Having had an Otterbox Defender for years, I finally wanted something fresh. The price of this case is steep, but there was really nothing else from my research that could hope to top the Defender like the Lifeproof. The case is better than I expected. It's waterproof, slim, and has better visual clarity of the screen than the Defender. One of my favorite features is what Lifeproof calls the "Sound Enhancement System," which causes the rear of the case to act as a speaker and enrich the bass of your music. I was surprised to find that my iPhone was in fact louder in the case than caseless. Call quality is perfectly fine and I've had no complaints from the other end. I wouldn't trust this case to drops like the Defender, but it's slimmer design, richer sound, and waterproof ability makes it a contender in my book. I cannot speak to their customer service, but Otterbox has the best customer service I've ever dealt with and that in my mind makes the choice between the two very hard. I give it a 4 out of 5 because of price and for the fact that the belt clip is an extra $30.
Does this product do what it claims to do? Absolutely. Is their customer support helpful? Absolutely. Does this product survive under high usage and wear and tear ... Not so much. I bought two cases. With the first case my opening and closing of the latch to charge my phone broke the gasket within 2 months. I wrote to their customer service department suggesting they work on the gasket and they offered to replace the front case without my even asking. Very kind of them but I declined as it wasn't that important to me. A week later my niece snapped the latch completely off and as I loved the case so much I bought a new one. Second case - I dropped the phone after 2 months and the only thing to break was the latch - completely useless now. I carry my phone in my pocket or lunch bag and the screen is scratched to almost unusable. I am a contractor and the phone/case is subjected to a lot of wear and tear. I expect to go through cases more than the average user, however, to replace a $79 case every two months is unrealistic. Most of my cases last 8-12 months at $19.99. Other contractors have recommended other cases that last significantly longer and until improvements are made I will be purchasing another brand. For a casual user that really takes care of their electronics I think this is the best case to own and wouldn't recommend anything else. It really is waterproof and more importantly dust proof. Additionally it enhances the speaker sound. For contractors or teens ... Look elsewhere, it will not last long enough to warrant the price.
This case is pretty nice overall. It's sturdy, it does protect the phone from shocks, it is waterproof and everything advertised is spot on. My downside is the charging port. Any aftermarket charging cables don't fit into the receptacle so I have had to improvise and purchase more Apple iPhone cords to compensate. I purchased the case because I have two twin infants at home who are now crawling. I use my phone all the time so it's usually not up out of their reach like it should be so inevitably it ends up in their mouths. After a scare with my iPhone where external sounds stopped working due to "water" getting in the headphone jack I knew I had to go looking for a better case. This case has solved that issue and now I can let the babies do whatever they want with the phone and not worry about it getting worried. Of couse I still try to keep things out of their reach and most certainly out of their mouths but just in case, we're good. I'd recommend this product to parents most certainly and as long as you test the case I can recommend it to those who want to take their phones underwater as well. If they were to fix the power cable receptacle this would be a 5-star review.
My daughter bought a brand new iphone and wanted this case for her protection. We followed the directions properly and she was excited to shoot a video in water, like they show in their videos - it destroyed the phone the very first time. Now, if customer service is important to you and a company that backs their product...well, this isnt the product for you. If you like companies that do false advertizing for their product, then buy right away. I called 3 times and no ONE would talk to me about their warranty - said a supervisor would and they would call me right away. 2 to 3 weeks later, I get a general email saying really nothing and that they are not liable. No returned call, as promised - and they wont discuss anything over the phone. HORRIBLE!!!! Stay away.
This case isn't without it's down sides, but the benefits for me far out weigh them. I've read some reviews about the case "failing" when dropped in water, but they probably failed to test the case prior to putting their phone in it, or weren't careful about how they put it on. I've had my case now for a few months, and actually use it in the shower almost every morning to listen to music while I get ready for work. I've also dropped my phone several times from anywhere from 3 feet, to 6.5 feet, and the case has handled every one of them without issues. I've worked around the headphone plug issue by getting some bluetooth headphones, and I use a port extender every night to plug my phone in to my alarm clock dock for charging. I agree it does seem flimsy, but I've had no issues with it so far, even though I thought I almost broke it more than once. I alos havea an "oil slick" on the screen that's a little annoying, but liveable. I took it appart, and recleaned it, but it came back, so I guess I'm stuck with it. I have noticed some change in call quality and picture quality, but nothing drastic, and it's still completely usable.
By far the best total protection for your iphone. It's not as bulky or heavy as other cases. The only downside for this product is the price, but its worth it if you have the money.
Sent to my brother-in-law as birthday gift. Bought one for myself and my kid-but warn you to test it before using. 1st one actually leaked some humidity and was replaced. Also had damage on the kid's one and was replaced under warranty directly with Lifeproof. Great product but always check it if you are going into the water.
I recently purchased this product from my local store and must say that if they had put just a little more thought and care into this product it might be worth the extremely high price they are asking, over 100 dollars if purchased with belt clip. The product itself seems as though it would be water proof but I have no real desire to test it as my primary concern is protecting my phone from drops for with the product seems as though it might far short of the protection offer by the otter box, as the exterior of this product is to ridged to absorb the energy of a fall. Overall, if water protection is you primary concern I would recommend this product, but if chock protection is what your conceded about go with the otter box or something similar.
Love this case, dont have to worry about my phone, ever!
had it for a month now.so far no issues.price can be better though.
I read so many reviews to try to make an educated purchase, and even after reading a few reviews that talked about the iPhones voice quality being altered by the LifeProof case, I decided to take the plunge and see for myself. Luckily, my local store had it in stock. I figured if I bought this case locally and had any problems with it, I could quickly exchange it without waiting for shipping. As soon as I got it home, I performed the water test as instructed by the LifeProof website and as expected, the case came through with flying colors. My real concern was to find out if there would be any voice quality issues, so I gave my iPhone a thorough cleaning and installed it into the LifeProof case. I don't know if the manufacturer corrected any earlier problems, or maybe the few people that have complained about an echo effect had a defective case, but after at least 25 calls, there is absolutely no change to the voice quality that people hear from my iPhone with the LifeProof case installed. I took several pictures both with and without the flash, and I'm extremely happy to report that there's no difference in the iPhone 4s camera quality with the LifeProof case installed. I consider myself to be a very discerning shopper and have to be extremely impressed with a product to leave a 5 star rating, but this case is definitely worth the high price tag. It's great to find a product that gets it right!!
I bought this case because it advertised water proof. I dropped the my phone in the 4 foot of water and the case failed. The warranty only covers the case not the phone. Terrible waste of money.
This case is bulletproof . It is a very good fit and adds minimal size to the phone. There are several accessories for this case as well. It has a nice bike mount kit and belt clip available.
This is an amazing case! Not meant for necessarily being in your pocket just the otter box. This case was designed to protect your phone not be fashionable and fit in your skinny jeans. It does what is supposed to do which is protecting your phone.
The cover was too thick interfered with reception and hearing the audio. I tested the reception and sound with and without the cover and decided this is not a good product. Also it will not work with any third party charge/sync cords since these are thicker and the width of the opening for the charging/syncing cable is based only on the Apple dimensions.
Already got it wet with a beer at the pool. Just wiped it off and it was just fine. love it.
Great case for your iPhone if you work or play around water.
Listen, this is an excellent case. However, I sold mine. The reason is this: I use my iPhone at home mounted to an iHome-type device. With the case on the iPhone it is impossible to mount this directly to anything. The reason is because the charging port/communications port is covered with a hinged contraption that is required to make the case waterproof. When opening the cover, it does not detach but is required to remain part of the cover. Therefore, this makes it impossible to mount to any device without an adapter. This is not necessarily a problem. The problem comes into play when you mount the iPhone still in the case with the adapter. It causes the mounted iPhone to be wobbly because it rests solely on that adapter which is about an inch and a half high. I overcame this by placing a support behind the iPhone. I did not feel comfortable leaving the iPhone in this wobbling position fearful that it would eventually cause damage to that port. The 2nd issue I ran into was that I connect my iPhone to the MIDI/iPod connector in my car. With the case in place, it requires the headphone adapter that comes with the case to be attached. This headphone adapter pushes into the headphone port and then screws down flush with the case. Again, this is a good thing because it causes the case to remain waterproof. But, when I get out of the car I do not want that six-inch headphone adapter cord dangling from my iPhone. Therefore, I have to unscrew the headphone adapter cord, reinsert the plug, and go on my merry way. Until, I get back in my car and have to repeat the process again. This case is wonderful if you do not intend to use headphones with iPhone or mounted to any device that you listen to the iPhone through speakers, or charge on the mounted device. Because I do this every day and every night, the case was more of a nuisance than of use to me. For example, my wife has the same case and all she does with her iPhone is read e-mail, iMessage, Facetime, and talk on the phone. She does not use headphones, and she uses the charging adapter that came with the iPhone. For her this case works. For me, it does not because I use attachments. This case has its purpose. It is to protect the phone as advertised. For this, it does a wonderful job. If you plan on attaching anything to this phone, I guarantee you this case will get in the way.
This case is perfect for the persone who is hard on their phones. It does everything it says. Very pleased with it
I had my Lifeproof for 5 weeks and it never worked properly. Always had to blow air into it so callers would not get feedback. The small plastic cap that goes over earphone opening can easily get lost. The worst was I accidentally dropped my phone from mid-thigh to wood floor. When I took off the Lifeproof case, my iPhone 4s had a very small mark and my iPhone features did not work where the mark was on the glass. I had to get a new iPhone and thankfully had Applecare. Lifeproof sent me a new case but there is no way I am going to use it on my iPhone. I am going to return the new Lifeproof they sent me back to the store. Your friends will dread calling you because of the constant feedback on the phone!
It don't stick to your pocket like the otter box Not as bulky either Would be nice for $99 with the clip
i am satisfied with this case. i have tested it and it seems to be waterproof. i havent tossed it up to see if the impact feature works but i hope that will never be intentional. i like that it is a slim case because i carry in my pocket very often. i researched a little before the purchase and wasn't able to find another case that had been military tested and was also waterproof. the only things that i have fround that i feel has room for improvment is the earphone plug that screws in the top has to be fully removed in order to use. problem is, is that it is very small and could easily be lost. wished it had some sort of lanyard to stay attached to the phone. second is that it seems to be harder to hear durning voice calls, at the ear piece and speaker in semi noisey enviroments. but the way i look at it is that i have traded that off for the phone to be protected and it be like a brand new one when i take it out of the case. the phone is complete protected from everything so it will look brand new once removed +
We got this for our daughter because she has been known to drop her phone in water. It is great in the fact it keeps the water/moisture from entering the phone and is able to take shocks that are cause from drops. Great if you have an active life style.
This was a gift to my boyfriend who does commercial flooring and constantly drops his phone and there is water and dirt. This case is perfect for him and prevents all debris from getting to his phone!
It works,best case ever for iphone.you must get one to and the belt clip is as equally as good.
The concept is good for people that are in extreme conditions. I though the earbud dongle could have attached itself to the case in a sleeker manner when not in use. Perhaps the extra plug could have a better storage as well. The biggest problem was the echo for those that I was speaking with. Yes, I did blow into the bottom of the case to try to create positive pressure. I couldn't create enough pressure to separate the screen protector from the mic consistently. Besides, really? Come on, you can't honestly expect that having to do this even occasionally would be considered normal. How do you explain to your coworkers that it really isn't the new kazoo app, but that it is a case design flaw?
I purchased this because I have small children who play with my phone. There are a lot of apps for children. I like that the case is slim and not bulky like the otterbox, but has a few small annoyances. You have to completely clean the phone and make sure it is dust free before putting it in the case, otherwise you have small particles inside the case. Also, the area where you plug in the charging cable is hard to plug in and you have to pull out the plug from the cord, weakening the charging cable. You can buy an extender from the lifeproof website, whick works, but is still a little tedious. Over all good though, since I feel that my phone is protected from just about anything.
I bought a lifeproof phone case three weeks ago from Bestbuy The case is expensive for what is . The lifeproof headphone jack covers fell off after using them and screwing them back in...Bestbuy would not supply new ones or give me a new cover. Great customer service by Bestbuy....would never buy from them again. I needed to buy new phone jack covers from Lifeproof who charged me $15.00 for a .05 cent item plus over $9.00 in shipping....big ripoff. Stay away from Lifeproof!!!!! Furthermore, I did research and you can now get your phone waterproofed thru liquipel for $59.00....seems like good new technology.
I wanted to be able to take my iPhone to the beach and on the Mayan cave trek (ATM) in Belize and use it as a camera. I merely wanted to protect it from sand and moisture in these environments. I have no intention of fully submerging the phone, although the empty case passed the leak test with flying colors. It worked fabulously for our Belize vacation and still looks very nice when cleaned up. No sound degradation has been noticed, either input or output. All controls work just fine. I certainly recommend this case for protection from sand, dirt, water encountered in beach, hiking situations. I'm glad I bought it!
The case is very nice and is waterproof. I have had some issues with callers hearing me. The speakers are definitely muffled. Also the headphone jack is painful unless you use the standard apple headphones. My biggest problem is with the screen cover. I've had mine about a week and have several scratches. You cannot add a good screen protector like Zagg. For $70 you'd think this might be covered by warranty. Zagg will send you a free replacement. I contacted Lifeproof and they said NO; not covered and no replacement. This not a 'Lifeproof' case, at least not for the way I live.
Talking is horrible. The sound echoes back to the person you are talking to...badly. If you have no plans on having an actual conversation with someone, then the case is great. I juat feel if I am going to pay this much money for something, then I should at least be able to use my phone for it's primary function, making calls. If you think you will get this and just "tolerate" the echoes, for me, there was no choice. It echoed so bad I had to connect an external headset just to hold a conversation. No, I would not recommend this to a friend.
Works fine as far as being water proof. Talking is horrible. The sounds echoes back to the person I talk to! They can hear themselfs talking!
its started good then it around the ear a hole happened then i drop it and in the corner it rip the rubber .. not worth the money only had it for 2 months ..
This case is perfect! Good quality, great customer service. No product is perfect but LifeProof comes pretty close!! Highly recommend, just buy it!
An expensive case, but the waterproof feature is great. Will not work with any docks because of the way the sync port is covered. Also most sync cords are too big for it. Uses an adaptor for the headphone jack, don't lose or damage it, an expensive replacement. A great case, but lifeproof sure is proud of them.
This case is truly amazing in every category. Not only do you not have to worry about your phone anymore you also aren't bothered with the extra bulk that comes along frequently with other cases. The Lifeproof adds to the phone without adding to the phone. You still have access to all your phone's ports and functions. Lifeproof is a genius was of making the iPhone complete.
Got one today! Just get online and watch the videos before you do anything. If you follow the directions you will have no problem. This thing is awesome!!! I put it to the test and submerged it in the kitchen sink. No problem! Make sure you get online read the manual and watch all the instruction videos before you do anything!!! Wife is getting a purple one. Just paid for it and gonna pick it up tomorrow!!!
I am in law enforcement and a trainer and have to be out in all kinds of weather! No matter what I have to go through at work I don't have to worry if my phone survived! Shock and waterroof! I know its safe! Thanks, Lifeproof for making such a great product! Fergo
While no case is perfect, my LifeProof (I have the black one) is pretty close! I no longer have to worry about the little mishaps (or big ones!) that happen in everyday life as far as my new iPhone 4S is concerned. Oops, I dropped it. Wipe it off, it's fine. Oops, I spilled my drink on it. Rinse it off, it's fine. Oops I accidentally went swimming all day with it (haha). Yep, it's still fine - that's what it was designed to do. I've used a ton of cases and have had all version of iPhones since the original, this case is the only one that has ever lived up to the hype. Even with all of that protection, it is still a lot slimmer than the other cases of this type. I also have the belt clip, which works very well.
My favorite color is black, my iPhone 4 is black, so it only makes sense I own a black LifeProof case. I can't ever imagine owning any other case for my iPhone. I have used other cases & skins but none offer the amount of protection & peace of mind that LifeProof offers.
Ever drop your $600 iPhone in the water by accident? Did is survive? If it was in any normal case (or not at all) it most likely didn't . I did just that--dropped my iPhone 4 in my father-in-law's pond. Didn't even realize it was there until I checked my empty pocket. Was I worried? Not even a bit! It was Lifeproofed! I had my mother-in-law call it. I only found it because I could see it's faint glow beneath the mud. All I did was pick it up and wash the mud off. It worked perfectly and continues to do so to this day. The sound clarity is phenomenal even through the Gortex speaker vents. I've even dropped it a couple of times on the ground--no broken glass! This is the true be-all-end-all case that has set a new standard!
At first I was sceptical about the case but it has already saved me 3 times and not to mention how awesome it is to be able to bring your iPhone in the shower and listen to music. For the type of case that it is it is super slim and light.
The Lifeproof case is the perfect case for everyday use, accidents, and intentional exposure to water, dust, snow, etc. The Lifeproof case is rugged, but very slim with little bulk added to the phone. My Lifeproof case has saved my phone several times already from accidental exposure to water, both at work and home, and has been used to take some great underwater pictures. Lifeproof has great, professional, and dedicated customer service and will take care of any (very few) issues that might arise during your use of their product. I love my Lifeproof case and can't wait until they come out with products to protect my other electronics as well.
I love my LifeProof case! I depend on my iPhone for so much more than "just phone calls." LifeProof makes it better by making it possible to take the iPhone into the water (I like to enjoy my hot tub, knowing that I can still receive a call or text from my kids while I'm in the water), relieving me from the worry that i'll drop my precious phone and lose my "lifeline" and favorite source of entertainment to a fall. I love that I can cook with my phone on the counter and not worry about getting gunk on the iPhone (I can literally WASH it with the LifeProof case on it). The LifeProof case is much more sleek than the Otterbox. The LifeProof case is easy to install.
My never ending search for the perfect case ends here. I've gone through so many cases and money searching for that one case that provides the protection i need for my lifestyle and job description, as an EMS/Firefighter, this case is PERFECT! Mil Spec rating for drops and dust protection as well as the best part of it.......wait for it.......IP-68 rating waterproof protection up to 6.6 feet. It's thin and lightweight and doesn't stick to your pocket, all the buttons and ports are easily accessible without ever taking the case off. I HIGHLY recommend this case and every product they put out, Best customer service and company i have ever dealt with. I honestly can't wait for what this company has in store for us in the future, I'm hooked, LifeProof for life.......Let's Go!
From rainstorms, showers, hot tubs, and puddles to a 6 year olds trip to the potty, this case has protected my beloved phone! Couldn't be happier with this product. Stylish, easy to install and does exactly as advertised.
I would NOT buy this product again. Be aware - only a 30 day warranty standard, case is not designed to be taken on & off, must use Apple-manufactured accessories. Too soon to tell whether the product is any good but the customer experience is awful. For $80 for a piece of plastic, you ought to get decent service. To get their 1 yr warranty, you have to take a test and get 100%. Problem is that if you miss one, it doesn't tell you which one. After multiple tries, finally went back to BB and asked them to help. 3 of them were nice enough to work together on the test & they still couldn't get 100%. Finally figured it out. Filled out the form and got an error message - so still no registration. Tried again (had to take entire test & complete the reg. form again). Same error. Sent email 2 days ago. No response. Tried to call today. Unlike most good tech companies, they keep short west coast hours, can't reach anyone.
I was looking for a case that would protect my iPhone. What I didn't count on was how hard it would make using the phone. After looking around, and willing to pay 80 bucks for a good case, I bought this piece of garbage. I have tried to live with it for about 6 months, and I finally gave up. What I can live with: o The screen protector does not sit directly on the phone screen, so you have to press hard to make contact. o It is a little larger, but for extra protection, I'm OK with that. What I can't live with: o The opening for the charger is too small and too hard to access. Only some charger work. I have three Apple chargers that are too big to fit it. One is in my wife's car, so on road trips I am out of luck. (They advise against taking it out of the case. It is hard to take in and out. Watch the video first.) Then if charging cord does fit in, you must yank it out, because you cannot reach in to squeeze the sides. I have already wrecked one charging cord. o In order to listen to music, you first have to unscrew a cap and then screw in a special adapter that is about 4 inches long with a plug on the other end for the aux cord. If you get a call, you have to unscrew the special adapter before you can speak. Very awkward. Oh, and don't loose the little screw cap, without it, you loose the waterproof aspect. Oh and as for the waterproof, if you really need it, then that would be the only reason to get this case. If you really want one, I will sell this one cheap!
so i've had this case for about a month and so far i love it. i have no problem with the touch screen or the speakers. the only problem i have, which is beyond frustrating, is when i try and go for a run/workout. my headphones won't fit the port and the adapter that comes with the phone is pathetic (or at least mine is). the connection is horrible b/t the adapter and my headphones. it sounds like a scratchy record and i'll loose sound through one of my ear buds... Does anyone have any suggestions to fix this? i've tries taping the two together... any help would be appreciated... thanks.
This is a great case that had perfect response. I have dropped it many times and little problems. If you want the most out of this product go to their website and watch their videos. I did and they will have all the proper care. I never think twice if the case can protect my iPhone 4S.
Sooo since I didn't upgrade at BestBuy and don't have insurance on my phone this was a must!! Love love love the case! I've had it since Best Buy has been selling them so I have the black! I would typically change out my cases often and have three bright girly speck cases in my dresser drawer that I haven't touched for months! Just get it already if you are on the fence about it, it's worth it!
DOES NOT provide protection against dropping. My wife's phone dropped out of her pocket onto the garage floor and the Iphone screen cracked just as easily as when it was not in any case. Save your money and use it to pay for a new screen, you'll come out ahead.
So far the phone as taken a couple of spills and the case seems to be doing it's job.
Case works! BUT no costomer service.. Phone number is worthless no answer,same for twitter account! Bought second gen for 4s people I call have hard time hearing me! Siri can't understand! Because of design of case I can't use docking station and the company has a dock extender but it's been out of stock for months!! Again worst part is lifeproof doesn't answer any calls,inquires or twitter posts! Sure it works to keep water out but it's worthless once your $400 phone is in it!! Horrible customer service! Don't make the same mistake I did and buy this!!!
I was like you, scrolling thru reviews, trying to decide if I wanted to fork out so much money for a phone case. I read some of these reviews and almost let it sway me from buying. Luckily I took a friends advise and took the plunge. Man, I am glad I did. This case is just like the phone it protects, light years ahead of the competition. I highly recommend you visit the LifeProof website before use to watch detailed instructions on how to install the case on phone. I followed the tutorial and had no problems. I can't even tell the phone has a cover on it. Functions work perfect and the screen is crystal clear and very responsive. The sound is muffled a few decibels but you can open the charging port, play with equalizer settings and lay the phone face down to help with song play. The back cover acts like a giant speaker (genius). I will gladly trade a few decibels for peace of mind any day. I use mine everyday to protect from rain, snow, mud, dirt, dust, scratches and anything else that goes along with a construction site. I can't wait to return to my favorite theme parks so I can finally get some great pictures and videos of the water rides. We have always taken plastic bags along to stuff cameras and cell phones in to protect them from the water. Not any more. I am already on the waiting list for the iPad version of this case. Can't wait! Thanks, LifeProof, for peace of mind. "LET'S GO!"
I bought this case when Best Buy first started carrying them after my Otterbox had gotten kind of oldish. I absolutely loved it at first and then started running into some problems leading me to go back to another otterbox. I love the screen and the thinness of the case. I happen to use a bose docking station at home and you cannot just plug this phone in. You have to get an extender that Best Buy does NOT sell. So I hit up a well known auction site and the waiting game started. I also happen to work in an office setting that blocks everything known to man on the internet. So I listen to my Pandora on my phone most of the day. Not a bad thing except that you have to figure that I was taking the extender in and out of the case daily. Then comes the little screw-in plugs at the top. They are extremely fragile after a month or so. I ended up going through the 2 that came with the case in less than 3 months. Not too big of a deal except Best Buy does not carry replacements and Lifeproof is out online most of the time. I ended up being stuck with a case that was no longer waterproof and overpriced. I ended up going back to the otterbox and my life of carrying around an extender and auxiliary cord are done.
In spite of some of the negative reviews that I have read, I have found this case to perform EXACTLY as promised. I have found no minor problems with it, let alone any major problems. Each of my chargers, including the one in my car, work perfectly; the touch screen works just as well as my iPhone 4S worked without the case; the fingerprints on the screen are no worse than the screen of the 4S; each of the buttons on the case work just the same as they did on the 4S itself. I would not hesitate to recommend this case for these reasons as well as for the excellent protection it offers to my 4S.
Excellent case. Just as advertised. Used iPhone to play radio while dry walling. Just rinsed it off afterwards. Looks good as new.
The Life Proof case has saved my iPhone 4S on more than one occasion. The product is as described. I do not know why others have had less than positive experiences with the case, as I have found no drawbacks as of yet.
The only two issues that people have complained about, audio problems and touch screen sensitivity, are NOT problems at all in my experience. I use my iPhone constantly all day for business. Not one person has complained about audio quality, and I have asked everyone. Touch screen sensitivity is just as good as it is with nothing over the screen. Now add the full protection against water, snow, dirt and shock and you have a winner! I have used it in the shower and pool! can't wait to go skiing! On top of all this, it's thin enough to still fit in your pant pocket! Perfect! Of course, the price is a little high, but now that I have used it, I would buy it again.
In making this case as protective as they have, there are a few awkward things that get dragged along. For example: some third-party car chargers don't fit in the hole designed to be for the Apple charge cord. For example: earphones cannot plug directly into the phone--they must plug into the somewhat unwieldy adapter that must be screwed in (to keep the water-tight quality, I would guess.). For example: each of the physical dimensions of the phone is noticeably larger than with the phone by itself. However, the main purpose is protection, and this is done well. While I have not submerged my phone as the store clerk did, I have dropped it, with no ill effects. There has been little noticeable loss of sensitivity to using the touch features of the phone, for dialing and for apps. And there are some nice touches. For example: the plug that covers the earphone hole could be easily lost, but there is a place included on the earphone adapter to firmly hold it. If a friend needed maximum protection for his phone, I would steer him to this product. In spite of the awkwardness, I still use it. But it is not perfect.
I learned about Lifeproof and thought it would be a great product. After reading reviews I became hesitant spending the money for it. I was planning on going skiing so I decided to give it a shot. I have to say that I am more than impressed. I'm so impressed that I use it everyday instead of just for skiing. The case fits perfect on an Iphone4S and I don't have any issues with sound, space, or talking on the phone. I do agree that the case "seems" cheap once you hold it without your phone inside. Once I got it on I completely changed my mind. If I could change anything on this product it would be the back casing. Within 1 or 2 minutes after putting the case on my phone I dropped it twice! It is just a little slippery.
I am extremely disappointed in this case. For $80, it should be a very easy to use and well thought out design. It is not. 1. The only charging cable you can use with this case is the one provided by apple. No other off brand cables will fit through the docking port. The only car charger I have found to work with this case is one that has a usb port. You can plug the usb from the apple charging cable into it. This also means if you have a docking station on your radio, alarm clock or other device, you will not be able to use it without taking the phone out of the case. You might think, well easy enough, stop being lazy, just take it out of the case, then put it back in. Well, that brings us to the next problem. 2. It is very difficult to remove the phone from the case. It also damages the case slightly each time you take the phone out. With this in mind, unless you want the waterproof seal damaged within a couple of weeks, it is not feasible to take the phone out of the case to charge or dock it. 3. For those of you that like to listen to music through your iphone, you will need special headphone adapters. You need a longer plug than what comes on most headphones in order for it to fit though the case. 4. Sound quality is not great through this case, and the screen protector is terrible. It makes the screen much less sensitive. 5. This case has also caused me many issues because it makes it very easy to turn the ringer completely off on your phone. A slight bump to the side button will cause you to turn the ringer off. It is not this easy if not in the case. 6. There are much better products out there for the price. It does do a good job of protecting the phone from drops and screen scratches, but so would a $30 case and a screen protector. Is it waterproof? Maybe. I did the water test and there was condensation on the inside of the case. This makes me very leary of putting my phone in the water. I does protect it from the rain, but I would not submerge it. The case specifically says, the company takes no reponsibility if your phone is damaged while in this case. A better product is the H2O sports case and headphones if you like to take you music swimming . I did end up purchasing these and so far have been swimming with them 4 hours per week since Christmas and they are wonderful. The H2O Sports brand does a quality assurance test on every individual product before shipping. This makes me much more confident. **I will be buying a different case for everyday use. Missing a call while being on call is not an option.***
I can't believe that it's waterproof still but it really is. Just be careful of the small attachment that you need to screw into the headphone jack because it's a very small piece that's easy to drop and lose. So if you remove it, don't remove it someplace where u will lose it if u drop it. It's actually more slender than the otterbox case. And it fits in my pocket. Even though it's fully enclosed, the speakers are still great. Not sure of the longevity yet. A negative is that it doesn't fit on all chargers but does fit on all of the white charger cables from apple.
I went swimming today with my iPhone in its Lifeproof case. Plus I actually was listening to music on the phone while I was sitting on the bottom of the pool. And 6 hours later I am writing this review. Lifeproof does what it promises it will do. Worth the money. Buy it!
I bought this for my 12 year old son to protect his Iphone. It works great. At first, I didn't want to spend so much for the case but it is well worth the money. He has dropped his phone numerous times & his phone wasn't harmed. We haven't put it in water but I am confident it will still work,
I have left my iPhone 4S under a bowl of water for more than 30min with no issues. I recommend this item as it facilitate takin pictures and videos under the rain, swimming pool, snowing day, etc...You can even answer a call while taking a shower.
This case does do exactly what it says and very well, at a cost both in use and price tag. When I got home I dropped it on the ground and dipped it in my pool and the phone is fine, in mint condition in the case. After 2 weeks of use I have found a lot of flaws that will keep me from buying it again, not all will of these affect everybody: The screen is touchier then you are used to with the built in screen protector. After a couple weeks of use, you get used to it. It adds a lot of bulk so it would not fit into my marine radio that was designed for the iPhone. Plugging it in to charge takes some practice. Sounds are muffled and even worse, people I talk to are getting horrible echo to where they could not talk to me on the phone. This was the last straw and why I can't use it. After all, phone quality is already a big issue on most smartphones. I also noticed that from taking the phone out of the case and back (approximately 10-12 times) that one of the seals near the mouthpiece had broken away. It looks like it was a sealant. IMHO, this phone has one type of person it is designed for; someone whose phone might get wet on a regular basis, otherwise for typical average everyday use, the cons outweigh the pros. This came highly recommended from the salesperson so don't be fooled.
This is a great case, water proof and shock proof. Meets mil spec. Out of all the rugged cases out there this is by far one of the best. The selling point for me was it is the least bulkiest. My phone stays in my pocket and my job calls for a rugged case. Sound is not greatly diminished as some people say (and I have bad hearing), all buttons are fully usable and though the screen protector is plastic it does the job. Reflection (to me) is not bad but you can place a anti glare screen film over it for an added layer if it bothers you. Other people complain about 3rd party head phones and chargers not fitting, they don't, it wasn't made with that in mind. Your standard iPhone headphones fit perfect and it comes with an adapter for 3rd party sets. My biggest gripe is the screen protector. For the high price you'd expext gorilla glass. Overall great rugged case for pockets.
Make sure to watch the installation first and before you leave the store, ya I know it's just a case but you will wish you had if you really want to protect your investment. Additionally make sure to open the package and inspect the microphone befalls inside the case for damage. This is the most sensitive part of the case and if you take your phone in and out a lot they can become damaged. The only thing I am not satisfied about is that if you want to attach anything but the original factory USB cord you need an adapter.
Ok, I'll start off by saying I have an iPhone 4 and when I first got it, I also got the Vapor Element case (1st Generation). I had A LOT of disappointments - after market chargers and headphones did not fit. I had to search the web for solutions which included getting charger adapters or shaving/filing the plastic casings on chargers and headphones so when I got the lifeproof case, I was already prepared somewhat. I have tossed the lifeproof case on carpet, tile, and hardwood floors and it did protect the phone (fully functional). It did scuff/scratch the case but phone was fine. My 6 and 10 year old kids have submerged it completely in the tub, sink, and fish tank at least six times and it did remain waterproof as advertised. Now I didn't take it out and put it back into the case more than 4 times so far so I couldn't attest to what some users say about it failing after a number of tries. I normally use the Bluetooth both for calls and working out so the headphone issue was not an issue except when I'm driving (use a cassette adaptor on 1 car and aux adaptor on another car. All I had to do was cut off a small part of the plastic casing at the end of the headphone jack so it will fit without having to screw in the adaptor that comes with the case (or have to buy an extra one from them, which is irritating). So if you are concerned with not being able to use after market headphones (only the Apple headphone jack fits, and I will not spend that money to purchase more Apple stuff), a little cutting will make it work. I'm a little concerned that lifeproof sells o-rings so I'm not sure on how long they are expected to last but the did indicate that the case is not meant to be removed and put back too often...
Expensive. Muffled sound from speakers. Makes you sound muffled to other people you call. Less response from touch screen. Screen protector makes the screen dimmer and a different shade. It is waterproof and dust proof. Great for a trip to the beach but not for every day use.
I travel all the time for personal and business and this case has now exceeded all of my expectations. In the restroom, in the plane, outdoors; in the rain, the wind and even with food. Every scenario in which the case as come in contact with dirt, liquid, shock, etc., it has protected the phone. The sound is great, the camera works great and you don't have to remove it to sync it using the non-fastening version of the syncing cable. If you use the fastening version, then you will have to remove the case to get the cable unfastened.
This is a great case for your iPhone, it's basically everything proof. I will say that you should make sure you have the phone really clean before you put it in the case because it's a pain to get in and out. Won't fit on any docks in the case, so that's why I rated it only 4 stars, otherwise it's a small investment to protect your iPhone! All the buttons work perfectly and the front screen cover doesn't really make the screen much less sensitive. I know 5 people with this exact case and they all love it.
Truly an amazing case. Works underwater, works in the desert, works in the ice and snow! Great when you have 2 and 4 year old girls that love water! I have taken photos underwater with this case to protect my iPhone 4S and the photos are awesome. It is also great when you are dealing with the wonderful Chicago weather conditions, doesn't prevent any sound clarity even in the wind and rain. The only issue I have had with it to date is the only plug you can use is the apple factory default. All other products you can buy for charging the iPhone with this case on do not fit. I have tried Rocketfish, Belkin, Griffin, Duracell, and a few others, none will fit as the adapter width must be thin like the one that came with the iPhone.
Wanted the best protection I could get, and that wouldn't make my iphone any larger than it already is. This fit the bill. Attractive, functional, slim,durable.
This is an exceptional, (so far) waterproof case for the iPhone 4s. My family has three such cases and they all function as advertised. We did notice one drawback, the case won't couple with my wife's car connection that would allow music to be played through the car's stereo.
Puchased this for my husband because he always complained about his OtterBox Defender cover for his iPhone 4. He said it was too bulky and wouldn't fit into a pocket easily. The LifeProof cover slides easily and still offers excellent protection. Our kittie knocked over a soda recently and it spilled all over his iPhone. Not a problem...the LifeProof protected as advertised against water spillage. Best money I have ever spent...no more complaints from my husband. Ahhhh....peace! The only reason it received four stars instead of five is the pricepoint. Ouch!
Really is waterproof, as I learned, and the case is slim which is a good alternative to the otterbox bulky case.
The Lifeproof case for iPhone 4/4S does what it says. Waterproof, shockproof, etc. the only con I have is a nasty echoing the other person on the phone can hear. If your an avid phone-talker, this case isn't for you. If you don't so much use your iPhone for talk too much, I'd recommend this case.
This case is absolutely a piece of garbage!! I had bought this case with my new iPhone 4s thinking that it would offer the best protection for my iPhone. I was severely mistaken. Sure it was waterproof but it took a 12inch fall onto a tile floor and the side of the case split open and the silent switch rocker broke completely. After superglueing my $80 case back together I had managed to waterproof it enough for my skiing trip. Glad I didn't go swimming. I emailed the company since they were supposed to have already sent me a replacement front to fix a light sensor problem with the iPhone 4s, and I got nowhere with the company for almost 2 months. They finally mailed my new case 2 days ago and when I got it today they had sent me the wrong part and a packing slip saying the box should've had the right part in it. If you're looking for good protection for your iPhone I would recommend the Otterbox Defender (the case I have now) or the Ballistic Hardcore case that my EMT brother has. Both of those are half the price and far superior to the Lifeproof junk.
I bought the lifeproof case only to find out it is the belt clip only. The advertising shows the phone case along with the belt clip, shady marketing, I get it home thinking things are missing, and read the box carefully and it says in thin yellow lettering towards the bottom of the box Requires iphone case to use.
Case is descent, it keeps water and everything else out. The screen cover almost always sticks to the screen creating that ugly suction spot that you would typically get from air pocket bubbles. The sound is muzzled. If you have a vehicle phone charger, do not purchase this case! None of them fit....
Have had this case since December. A lot of people complain about head phones and chargers. I have had no problems. I use a inocase car charger. Fits perfect. And I also use Bluetooth headset. Never have to worry about taking the plug out. Invest in Bluetooth and have no worries.
I received this as a Christmas present and liked the idea of it being waterproof as I'm very careful when it rains or snows that my phone doesn't get at all wet. However, after using it for one afternoon I realized when I made phone calls the person on the other end could barely hear me after they kept complaining. I called my line from another phone while my boyfriend was on my phone and I couldn't believe how hard it was to hear him. I looked on a few websites and found this is a common problem and a few "fixes" to improve it. I tried these "fixes" and none improved the call quality at all. The other thing I noticed is it is hard to text or write an email. It turns your touchscreen into a "push screen" as you really have to apply pressure for the phone to recognize what you are doing. This is very annoying and time consuming. This was returned after using it for only 8 hours or so.
I have only had this case about 4 weeks but I think the phone works very well inside the case- I have had no issues with the touch screen or other functionality. I have not gotten the phone totally wet but it is nice not to have to worry if it is raining or if something get splashed on the phone.
I just came back from a two week vacation in Hawaii and every time I went for a run it rained. Now I can honestly say I have finally found a product that does not make me interrupt my run or ziploc my phone while listening to music and using my running apps. While there, I was also able to enjoy hiking, kayaking, going to the beach, all while taking pictures and using my phone as needed. Although in socal it doesn't rain as much, at least now I have the peace of mind that my phone is protected in case (insert word) hits the fan. The only drawback is the inability to dock it or use any charger other than the standard iPhone cord. The lifeproof website a of today is out of stock from their charging adapters, so no 5 stars for that. If you are not into outdoors or sports, then this is not for you, maybe stick to the otter box instead.
A personal fact about me, I love music. Which is why I got an iPhone (iPod + phone, perfect). This case however, was not designed with those kinds of people in mind. I can live with removing that little knob on the top intended to vacuum seal the device to put my headphones in. However the hole made in the top of the case won't allow that. Instead they provide an adapter that screws in to connect headphones. Now personally, I can live with taking calls via earbuds, but just say I get a call for someone else (someone who hates earbuds)...SOL there. It makes things really inconvenient. The second I realized my headphones would be essentially screwed into the case was the minute I decided to return it. And no, disconnecting the headphones from the adapter won't return the device to normal. The adapter will be read as headphones wether or not they are attached. While the earbud matter was my fatal flaw, there are some other problems (ones I could live with).... -very sticky buttons. They require a significant amount of pressure to use at all. -essentially unprotected front. I like cases that have something around the Home button. Just makes me feel more confident that if it lands face down, I'm good (let's face it, if you drop your phone, chances are it will land face up or down. Better safe than sorry). The whole front of the device is essentially exposed. That's my 2 cents on this. I'm a college student studying computer science in PA. I use my phone a lot. But my phone doesn't go through hurricane winds, flash floods, or earthquakes. We get snow, but put your phone in a pocket of a good coat and consider it snow proofed. So if your a person who wants a protective case for general use, don't go with this. Otter does some respectable work, try those. Not water proof but suits the needs of a typical user better.
The vibration of the front cover causes an echo. The person you're talking to hears his/her voice double every time they call. Also, DO NOT REMOVE IT FROM THE CASE MORE THAN 2 TIMES, IT WILL BREAK on the inside. It's too expensive for the quality it really has. Don't buy it on ebay because the warranty won't apply to them...Customer services is very good
I have been very disappointed with this case. The screen cover gets very foggy and does not clean easily. The standard charger will not fit into the phone w the case on. You have to purchase the charger with a slimmer profile. It is not compatable with any accessories that play the device in a docking station. It is very difficult to get the case on and off so realistically I can no longer enjoy my iPhone as a music source at home or in my car. The structure of the case makes it much more difficult to type, adjust the volume/sound as well as the power button. I would not recommend this case if you dock your phone for any reason or if you don't want to replace all of your chargers/connectors.
This is a great case .I got it a few days ago it works great . The water proof feature is awesome . I have video taped under water and watched Netflix in the shower. No problems with the talking quality . Over all the case is great for every one. Great for outdoors and for under water video.
The quality of this case is junk, once your phone is enclosed or "protected", it breaks. Also you have to spend an extra twnety dollars for an adapter if you want to use your iphone on a docking station, a car charger, or a good FM transmitter. the headset adapter is also lacking in quality. JUNK!
At first I was extremely excited to get this case; I always fear something happening to my iPhone 4S. Life Proof said that it protected against water, snow, dust and shock. The first three all seem very reasonable, but shock: not really. The case, although light, is made from very cheap plastic. The screen protector built in is very clear, but it started to have these oily-type rainbow streaks/bubbles. This is why I have never like screen protectors: bubbling/quality. I am very disappointed that after only two days I have to return it because the screen shows streaks/bubbles.
After reading some reviews I was kind of concerned about getting this case. However I needed a durable case that was water proof etc. This case was the answer. I had the otter box for my other iPhone and you think with the name otter it would be water proof or at least resistant well guess what its not. After spending a day in the rain at a containment scene the phone was soaked and lost. I got the iPhone 4s and this case. The phone already has spent the day in the rain and a fall in the lake when I took it with me on my waverunner and the phone is completely intact. The headphone adapter is made so the phone can remain water proof, I have sony all weather earphone and they work great with the adapter. So if you are military, police, fire or just plan active this is the right case for you.
Case does exactly what it says it does. Its waterproof, dust proof, and its slimmer than an otterbox. Only downside to this case is that an adapter is required to use headphone jack or if you want to dock it. Salesman let me know this when I bought it so this was no surprise.
I wish someone would have steered me away from this huge waste of money. Needless to say, it broke pretty fast upon receiving it. The worst part is that there is absolutely no customer service. Nobody ever answers their customer service phone line, and some of the lines are even disconnected. Emails bounce back and forth with little resolution. However, they seem to respond to Facebook posts (whatever that is worth, horrible business plan). Shame on Best Buy for offering this product without investigating the company first. I had to file with American Express to get a response and my $ back.
Lifeproof customer service is horrendous been trying to get into contact with then for almost a week regarding a warranty issue with no reply. If you buy this product expect no kind of warranty support.
This case is amazing! I take underwater videos of my kids in the pool and at the beach, I've dropped it several times and had my iPhone completely survive, and it looks great! I refused to get an Otterbox because of how bulky they are and how "sticky" the rubber on their cases is, instead the Lifeproof is thin, sleek, and not sticky at all. I will say that some of the reviews on here are disappointing because they talk about how they had poor sound quality, or how you need to use an apple charger with the case, or how you need to use an adapter to use headphones. I'm disappointed because whoever had a case with poor sound quality said they're just going to return the case and be done with it. I too had a case with poor sound quality and when I reached out to Lifeproof about it, they sent me a new front for the case and that completely cleared up the sound issues! That person returned the greatest case ever without even trying to see if there was a fix. Yes, you use an adapter for headphones, I find no issue with that. Yes, you need to use an Apple charger or a knock-off charger that is the same size or the charger won't fit into the case, but isn't that worth the security to know that your phone is protected? I can't say enough how happy I am with this case. I've had 8 friends/family members buy it after I showed off it's abilities and I will continue to recommend it to everyone I can. Not only is it a quality product, but the company stands behind it to fix any issues and make sure you are satisfied. That's hard to find these days...
Definitely a durable and slim case. Very good. Unfortunately, I will be returning it due to it's inability to fit most standard headphone jacks. I have the Bose MIE2i headphones, and they will not fit. The case comes with an adapter, but you must screw it in each time to use it. Also, the slightest movement may make you lose sound in one or both ear buds at times. TL;DR: Good for protection, bad if you plan on using headphones.
This has to be the best case I have seen so far for the iPhone. I am pretty rough on my phone at times. This case has stood up to the punishment with no damage to my phone.
My son has damaged several phones. He has cracked a screen and jumped in the pool with one. After spending this much on a phone I wanted to make sure that it did not get damaged.
When I first got this case, I couldn't believe how slim and sleek it was, and yet the protection it boasts is seemingly bulletproof. This was my first iPhone, so I played around with it for quite some time, downloading new Apps, browsing the web, etc. For this purpose, the case excels. The screen is somewhat interfering, though certainly not the worst I've tried. When I finally decided to make some calls, everyone kept telling me they were having a hard time hearing me. There seems to be some sort of static on the other end, along with my voice being dampened by the case. Since I don't feel like yelling on all phone calls (and thanks to Best Buy's 30-day warranty), I will be bringing this case back to the store.
I had an Otterbox for the past year on my iPhone 4, and was very impressed as it saved my phone from utter annihilation on multiple occasions, including about five times when it fell over 30 feet onto asphalt. I hated how the rubber cover would always peel off when removing the device from my pocket and hadn't heard of the Lifeproof case until a family member told me about them. Went out and bought mine that day, was amazed at its waterproof abilities (which have become a party trick of sorts) and its durability. The most incredible case I've ever seen / heard of / used. HIGHLY recommended for people like me who are notoriously hard on phones.
LifeProof is a new company marketing an innovative and highly functional ultra protective case for iPhone 4/4S. If their iPhone 4/4S case is any indication of what the iPad 2 case is going to be like LOOKOUT. LifeProof case for 4/4S gives you protection where and when you need it from all of the elements without adding significant bulk to your device 1.5mm to be exact. plus the company offers a plethora of accessories to satisfy every adventurous need. If this first offering from LifeProof functions this well, I cant wait to see what they make next! The bottom line is you will spend at least 80-100 dollars on screen protectors and other inferior cases and only end up wishing you would have bought a LifeProof case first.
I never write reviews, but after seeing a few bad ones for this product I figured I would give mine. From what I've read here are the cons about this case: bad audio (speakerphone & regular mode), bad touchscreen response, bad audio on other end of call and bad glare when outside. Also people complained about the charging port just big enough for standard apple chargers. All of these couldn't be more wrong. The audio is fine from all aspects, the glare is no different than the phone without the case or any invisishield and the touchscreen response though noticable is no problem for my fingers. The piece of mind is worth the price tag. Already tried it in shower, no problemo. $70 for a case that protects a $600 phone. Worth it.
This is the perfect case for my 4s. It is water proof as I've tested. If you follow the online instructions you will have the best results. You can get rid of the air pockets if you follow the video. It is so strong for its thickness. If your thinking about spending that $80, don't its well worth the money. Why not pay $80 on a case instead of $15 a month protection plan?(Verizon)
Bought this case after much debate with myself. Due to what seemed to be a high price. I've been using it for about a month now and I really like it. Easily in and out of the pocket, I've dropped several times, took video under water. Anyway I have no trouble with any echo sounds when I talk to other people not on my end or theirs.
I was excited about this case. I followed the instructions on testing the product in the sink for an hour, cleaning the iPhone4 (i even used compressed air). I took swimming in ocean to take pics while on swim. Worked great the first 2 times. Was able to text the picture to a friend even. 3rd time I swam - the touch sensitivity wasn't working and I couldn't unlock phone. I swam in. Phone said missing SIM card - I opened case and water poured out and phone went DEAD. $150 to replace at APPLE. DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!
This is a solid case with great protection from the elements. If your main concern is protection, or the ability to take your phone into water then this is the case for you. The problem I have with it is accesibility for everyday use. My Skull Candy earphones jack will not fit in the port so I have to use the supplied adaptor. This screws into the headphone port and adds about 5 inches to your cord. If you remove the headphones from the adapdor, you don't get sound from the phone. You have to unscrew the adaptor before you get sound and you'll have to screw in another plug if you want to maintain water integrity. You can use Apple headphones without the adaptor if you like. The other problem is the bottom port that will not allow for anything other than an apple sync cable and even that can be a struggle at times to get in. I cannot use my car charger nor my stereo adaptor with this case. It is not a simple thing to take this case off. Also, the screen cover fits loosely and can make hitting the correct letter while texting difficult. This is an expensive case that I will use if I am going for a swim, or biking in the rain, but when you pay about $80 for a case you expect to be able to use it easily at all times.
I have to say that I did not buy this case to go underwater or do any crazy things. Getting out of the car I dropped my 3gs and shattered the screen. So I hoped to get a case that could protect me from this disaster with my new 4s. The case looks good and is light weight. My wife and I both received our 4s phones and we both bought lifeproof cases. She told me when I called her at work using the new phone and case that I sounded like I was talking in a coffee can. After that I had her call me at home using her new phone and case and she sounded the same way. I took the case off and the sound returned to normal. So the clarity of calls is diminished with this case. Also, if you have a car charger do not expect to use it. Both of mine did not fit and any after market chargers in my house did not fit either. Those are some things to consider when buying this case.
I have had both cases on my iPhone 4s and have seen both in action. People can complain about Life Proof not being worth the $80 all they want, but they are just cheap people looking for a cheap case. If all you are worried about is dropping your phone, then otterbox is the way to go, as long as you do not mind carrying a brick in your pocket. Life Proof has room for improvements of course, but is by far the better case. Watch some videos about Life Proof on the internet and the torture tests people put them through and notice how you will never see people doing half the things they do with an otterbox case on their phone. Yes, nothing lasts forever and there is room for improvement, but come on people. Hands down Life Proof wins this battle.
Love the case, ordered a few of them. Customer service is THE WORST of any company i have done business with in years.
I bought this case after seeing youtube videos of what it could do. Tested it myself in water and yes it is completely waterproof. The $80 for the case is a bit steep but is worth it. The case has a small gap between the back of the iPhone and it to resonate the sound, and it works incredibly well. NO you cannot use the touchscreen underwater, though this has nothing do with the actual case. If you do need to contact customer support, you need to remember that the company is still very small, they will respond just give them time. I highly urge people looking for a rugged case to get this one, remember that the case is $80 is a lot cheaper than $600!
I am writing to let everyone know about my experience with the Lifeproof case. I bought the case 2 weeks ago for the 4gs. This company has a great idea with the "4 proofs," but the actual performance is fair. I followed all the instructions for the warranty and did the leak test. To my surprise, it actually worked. The case was bone dry. After doing the test and reading more through the company website, I realized that the auto brightness feature will not work with the 4gs and that the company will send a new front plate for the case. A simple form to fill out, but will take weeks to arrive. After installing the case on my phone, I really noticed that it is very light and feels cheap. I do not believe this case is shock proof. It is no where nearly as protective as the OtterBox, but is a lot smaller and less bulky. My major problem is the echo that the person on the other end hears. It is almost unbearable to most of the people I talk to. I went to the internet again, and Lifeproof is aware of the issue. They explain that it is because of a difference in pressure to the outside of the phone. Their remedy is to blow into the microphone. A simple fix, that does not work. I expect no problems out of a $70 case. I called Lifeproof customer service and they never returned my call. I will be returning this case back to BB for an exchange to the OtterBox
I just got my lifeproof 2 days ago so the verdict is still out on some things but I thought I would share my immediate opinion. I bought it because my Otterbox was destroyed and the Otterbox was so bulky I was looking for something less bulky but also I wanted something that would protect my phone. So far so good except for one thing. my charger that came with my phone does not work in it. It won;t go in but the charger I got with my ipod does work. I think the ipod charger is a little less bulky.I have 4 chargers because I like keeping one on my bedside table for at night, another one in my office and another one in my laptop case so I always have a charger no matter where I go. Out of these only one works. The car charger also works but those 2 is it. That is aggravating. They need to make it so all the chargers meant to be used with the iphone work with it. This is the reason I only gave it a 4 instead of 5 stars. Suzanne
I am yet another one of the many that got suckered by the marketing of this product. A slim, waterproof, shockproof case? Awesome right? Not so much. After living with the case for 2 weeks it is going back for a refund and being replaced with an Otterbox. I'm glad I purchased from Best Buy because those that bought direct are having horror stories trying to return their case for a refund. The concept is great, but the case just isn't finished well. It seems like they rushed it to market, and now they are having to backtrack and fix the flaws. The case is waterproof at first, but it seems like it won't stay that way. I personally met two people who fried their phones showing just how "water proof" their couple month old cases were. I'm not going to wait around for that to happen for the $80 I paid. There are several problems with this case. The screen is highly reflective, so you can't see it in direct sunlight. Additionally, there is a space between the screen protector and the phone that doesn't go away with time. It makes the phone screen much less touch responsive, and where the screen and protector did touch, there were rainbow, oil-stain like marks. The phone is also very muffled when in the case. Oh, and none of your aftermarket accessories, headphones, and chargers will work with this case unless you spend another $35+ on adapters. Basically if you do a little research on this case, ALL of the reviews say the same thing. The widely positive reviews out there all seem like they are coming from the manufacturer themselves, or from people who were given free cases. Very disappointed with this purchase. If I had paid $35 for the case, I would probably hang onto it, but for $80 it is a ripoff, especially since it doesn't even come with a belt clip. Oh, and it is NOT compatible with the iPhone 4S. Lifeproof have said they are fixing the issue, but the updated cases will be available ??? No thanks!!!
This is literally the best case you can buy. It is amazing. I love it. The screen cover is protective, without feeling like there is anything there. The case is not nearly as thick as most other cases, and is just as effective at keeping the phone safe from drops. I've put it in a glass of ice water, and it's totally fine. It also can be washed off if you get it anything on it! It is really worth the money.
Just got this. brought back an open box b/c it had some scratches on the screen. Not great at sunset. Glare is really bad. Screen bubbles a bit making quick texting a bit getting used to. But he's the facts. I work outdoors rain or shine. Heights, sand, snow, and worst of all conditions, I have 3 kids that love my phone. I wish the body was tackier so it wont slide, but all in all, youll be laughing when u can use your phone during that next hurricane, raining ball game or what ever u do. Small sacrifices for such a safe case. I like it. dont love it cause it's over priced. Just dont lose your phone. I use bluetooth so i dont know what the deal is with feedback or echoes but i noticed at full volume, sound gets caught in the phone which could be the source but only proves it's locked tight.
I have had several iPhone cases to include the OB Defender and the Griffin. The OB broke into several pieces when dropped and the plastic screen protector basically fell apart not to mention you could never get it out of your pocket and the outer skin constantly peeled back and was lose. The Griffin was great but same problem with the rubber and difficulty getting it out of your pocket not to mention its like carrying a small tank in your pocket and neither of these were waterproof. Pros: Now for the LifeProof, overall a great case if your concerned about water and shock. You cannot beat it and there is nothing like it on the market as of Oct 2011. I am constantly dropping it in water just to show it off and get some laughs. The outer skin and plastic are superb and it does not stick in your pocket at all. It has some rubber grip feel to it in between the plastic and back which gives great grip when holding it but avoids getting hung up in the pocket somehow. It is very durable plastic not cheap like the Otterbox and the screen protector seems to be somewhat scratch resistant. I doubt much will harm your phone while in this level of protection unless something hits the screen directly hard enough to break the glass. The size is amazingly small for the level of protection you get. It is about the size of a normal iPhone Otterbox case with one level of protection! Not much larger than the phone itself just a tad bit longer, really insane when you think about it. Cons: There is a pretty big gap between the screen protector and the glass so when you are typing or trying to click on something you have about 1/16th of an inch play in the screen protector and glass which is very sloppy. I tried sucking the air our but no dice the screen plastic is just not snug enough to the glass and needs to be more form fitted. The screen protector is very high gloss and has constant glare. It also is the worst I have seen for picking up grease and fingerprints and difficult to remove without a solution. If you plan on using speaker phone forget it! The sound coming out of the phone to include your ringer is now reduced by 30% if not more. There is even a vibration when it rings or plays music. When you are listening to a call the sound is muffled quite a bit. I used it with the volume up all the time but kept missing calls so I had to switch to an irritating ring tone just to hear it. The trap door at the bottom which covers the charger port does not open wide enough to fit anything other than a standard apple charge cable. This is a problem if you use the larger 2.5v griffin cord for fast charging like I do but not a show stopper just not well thought out. It will break in time for sure. Overall: I deal allot with waterproof camera housings for underwater photography and this is basically what this was built around same principal with the o-rings. However you are a complete knucklehead if you plan on taking a $650 iPhone snorkeling or diving in this case protected by an o-ring! One hair in the seal and your done. There are other devices for that lol not to mention you cant take calls underwater.....or can you? As for the cost, no way in h*** this thing is worth $80 dollars! You are simply paying for someone else's creation and that's it. It's not titanium but apparently LifeProof thinks it is with that price. If you're in need of protection from the elements and are around water etc then this is for you. If you're an office jockey then there is no need. I was going to purchase a few more for my kids phones but will hold off now until the company decides to respond to my emails about the iPad case. They also expect you to buy the ipad case by preorder with only one small image of the product on their site. I also want to continue testing this out before I invest in a few more. Although its worth what you pay the first time it hits the water it has far to many cons vs pros so thumbs down on this until the price drops and they fix the few issues. The sound is the biggest deal breaker for me. Life Proof should try and return emails instead of sending out advertisements and junk email I never signed up for.
After reading several positive reviews of this product, I decided to purchase one for my new 4S. It really is a fantastic concept, and I was excited to find a product that addressed all of the protective qualities I want in a case. During phone conversations, I started receiving a lot of complaints of an "echo" or "feedback" that the person I was speaking with was able to hear, but that I couldn't hear at all on my end. The feedback was present when I was speaking directly into the handset and through the speakerphone function, but not present at all when utilizing bluetooth in my vehicle. After completing a restore of the device, people were still complaining about the feedback so I contacted Verizon Wireless. Their tech support passed me on to the advanced tech support team, and after troubleshooting reception issues and hearing the feedback for themselves, they decided that it had to be a hardware issue and that they were replacing the device. Tonight I received a call, and again the same feedback complaint in both handset and speakerphone mode. I then asked the person on the other end to hold-on because the only thing I had yet to try was to simply take the case off and see if the feedback problem was still there. It wasn't - not for the next 15 minutes of the conversation in handset or speakerphone mode; not in the subsequent calls made to test the device after that conversation was over. Anyway, I am returning the case tomorrow. I really do hate that it didn't work for me. Oh...and placing my corporate iPhone4 in the case - surprisingly there was no issue with it - it just happens with my 4S.
This case is not only Waterproof and durible! It feels nice in the hand and keeps the phone thin! I never usually buy a case or any accesory for 79.99, but when I got my iphone with no Applecare I figured i better stay on the safe side. Iphones are one of the most fragile phones on the market. You NEED something like this. The waterproof part is just an added bonus! Pros: Waterproof Sandproof Duribility All around feel Look Cons: Cost You lose some sound volume. You lose the slightest bit of touch accuracy (very little) Headphone jack is hard to get to, but added Headphone cable helps It's worth the investment just to throw you phone in a pool or take it in the shower just cause you can!!!
I've read the other reviews and while I agree with some of the grips, I would have to ask to some level what would you have expected? I ordered this case right from the dealer, didn't know Best Buy had them or I'd have gone there! So far I have been very pleased with the case. I will say I use my phone mostly for calls, texting and ipod but I do sometimes use the camera feature. Basically you are gonna get a case anyway, why not get complete protection. I will say, for those who live like me, my job has me working outside in the elements, I need not worry about my phone. I also ride a motorcycle and use my phones Ipod for music while riding. If you ride, when haven't you gotten stuck in some kind of rain event? Same with someone who exercises outside? Well, you need not worry about the phone. Lastly, if I'm not on the bike then we are in the Pines (a huge forest nearby) in our Jeep! For those who don't know, the Pines are predominately a sand area, full of deep to moderate puddles, but also can be extremely dry and dusty, and if you've wheeled them you know dirt/dust/water gets everywhere; in and out of your Jeep/vehicle and you! I'm sure it's like that other places too. I know many of our gang who wheel have Iphones and I'd highly suggest this case to any of them. As long as I have an Iphone, it will be wrapped in a Lifeproof case! IMHO you can't go wrong with this case if you like to live a little on the fun side out of work!
I ordered the gen2 case from their website which has additional bumpers to protect the volume and noise switch. I have to say this is an amazing case. Unlike the vast majority of cases you can purchase this case doesn't just cover your phone; it protects your phone. Even if you don't plan to jump into the pool and record your pool vacuum, the waterproof feature is awesome for when your phone is in a pocket (especially the chest pocket on ACUs) and you pour a good sweat. Unlike some other rugged cases such as the otterbox this one keeps the dirt and grim out that builds up on your phone when you don't take it out for a while. After being in the pocket of an army ranger for 2 weeks and keeping my phone alive it earns my full approval. They need to develop some android cases so all of my soldiers can keep their phones well protected. For the speaker muffled problem their site instructs you to blow into the vent with the phone removed to push the gortex cover off of it and it works pretty well.
ok so i purchased this case because i wanted to protect my phone when i go swimming and i want to make videos in the water. the waterproof part works great, i dropped my phone twice and if it did not have the case I'm sure i would have some ugly ding on the phone ( of course i exchanged the case at best buy after the drops) the biggest problem with the case is the sound when your phone rings its muffled i have missed at least 20 calls in the last month because of this. the sound when you are in the water filming is terrible but not many water proof cams have good sound while in the water so I'm not really going to blame the case. i Facebook and tweet a lot and even though the case is not that bulky it is still bulky enough to make typing fast a little annoying as does the plastic that protects the screen. playing games is a little off to because of it. so what you really have to ask yourself is if these little pet peeves are worth it and to be honest with the iPhone 4s coming out on the 14th and now apple care (99.00 only at time of purchase) covers accidental damage at a 49.00 fee is this case worth it. i will keep it but only during the summer after that it comes back out. I'm still waiting to see how it will affect the siri feature of the 4s. now the worst thing that i have no idea why they do this is if the case fails due to no fault of your own and the iPhone is damaged life proof does not pay for it. sounds strange for a company that says it protects the phone from water and shock and mud and dirt and so on. they should stand behind their product 100%
I have had this case since they came out in May. It has out performed all other cases I have owned. The Otterbox, Speck, Incase, etc. have nothing on this case. Adds very little bulk will not stick to pocket. The only complete waterproof case for iPhone. Awesome customer support from LifeProof. BADASS as close to bulletproof case you can buy. Please note: Screen will be slightly less responsive due to screen protector, but barely noticeable after using for a while. Small price to pay for such an outstanding case.
At first glance this phone case seems like the ULTIMATE of all iPhone 4 cases. It's Shock Proof, Waterproof, Dirt Resistant, Snow Proof, all for these qualities for a price tag of $80.00. Seems so great right? Why not spend the money for the ULTIMATE iPhone 4 case right? WRONG! Let's talk about the features of the Lifeproof Case. Problems are listed below. 1. It is not shock resistant whatsoever. It fell from the pocket of my hoodie, and a giant chunk near the upper right towards the back came flying off. Shock proof right? Nope. 2. Waterproof is great cannot debate that, but I can debate the sound quality out of your speaker, IT'S DULLED OUT! I have lost probably at least 30% of the actual speaker with the case on. Take a video with your case on and without the case, see the difference? 3. Photos and videos are a lot duller and less vibrant with this case on. 4. The most and last annoying feature on the phone case is that you have to keep unscrewing the top of the case to access the headphone port if you choose to exercise or use a headset. They do give you the expansion cord to make this less annoying but who wants a 6 inch wire hanging from your phone? Look, if you are the type of person who likes the advantages of taking videos under water and likes going out in the rain and jumping into a big puddle this case is for you. If you are the person that likes to hop on the toilet and play some games, text, and call people while on the can and you want the reassurance if you drop it down the toilet then this case is for you. Looks are deceiving, but you be the judge on it.
i ordered this case directly from their website. I have had it for approx 2 months and love it. This is hands down the best iPhone case
I need a tough case. Between the kids and myself my phone is dropped and exposed to different elements (water, dirt, sticky food covered fingers) on a constant basis. I don't need a case just to cover my phone I need one to protect my phone and this case does that. I didn't buy the case to be 'waterproof' but it's nice to be able to have the option to play angry birds or listen to music in the shower "just because". This case goes beyond my expectation and so has the LifeProof customer service.
When l first opened the LifeProof packaging I was initially shocked because the case looked so delicate & fragile - but looks are deceiving & once l had snapped it into place it was as solid as a rock, whilst still being as light as a feather. My initial installation did not go well because the screen did not sit straight in the top right-hand corner. After contact with LifeProof they suggested l re-install the case & boy did correct installation make a big difference, my screen now sits perfect. I also removed the tiny piece of plastic added to the LifeProof home button area, for me the home button works better without it. My top tips for installation are:- * Clean your phone impeccably * Unscrew & remove the top bung from the front cover piece * Place your phone into the front cover & then visually inspect your screen front to make sure it is perfect before snapping the back cover on * Screw the bung back in The case looks great & feels very comfortable in my hand. My screen is now flat & l have no issues playing any of the hundreds of iPhone games that l have amassed. For me the best feature is that it is waterproof! I enjoy taking my LifeProofed phone into the shower every day & listening to TuneIn Radio, as well as playing games & tweeting on it. This case has really grown on me & l love it.
This is the best iPhone case that I've ever had, and I've had them all. This case gives you the comfort of knowing that you can take your iPhone anywhere and not have to worry about it getting damaged if it gets wet, dropped, dirty, sat on by an elephant (hey, it could happen), or anything else that your daily life might throw at it. Have you ever wanted to play music on your phone while your in the shower? Now you can. Ever wish you could take your phone with you while snorkeling and get crystal clear videos of fish that you can't even pronounce? Now you can. Have you ever just wanted to dunk your phone in a pitcher of beer while drinking with your buddies? Now you can. The possibilities are endless with this case.
for everyone that has a iPhone knows what it feels like to not even want to move with the phone in your hand. the iPhone to be honest is the most fragile phone I've ever owned and fragile is not good in life. lifeproof has not only made me feel safe from falls, but everything life throws my way! my iPhone will never bethe same! lifeproof made me feel ok to carry my phone outside, made me feel ok to listen to music in the shower, made it ok for me to go to the beach and take pictures and not have to worry about my sons sand castles burring my phone underneath! it is the most amazing case you could possibly own! no juice, water, paint, sand, concrete and pretty much anything else will get in the way of things you want to enjoy! lifeproof took the iPhone to a whole different level! I could not be happier! then if that wasn't enough, the customer service is extraordinary! they treat each of their customers like a actual person and are always more than happy to do whatever they can to see their supporters happy! there's no question about it lifeproof is the way to go! it offers protection no other case can! worth every dime! 80 bucks now will save you that 400 dollars later when life proves to be to much for our phone! <3
I've been looking for a case for my iPhone 4 and never was happy with the looks or the protection that other cases offered. In my mind and imagination I knew what kind of case I wanted but nothing came close. Until I found lifeproof. This is the case that I dreamed about having. Lifeproof has finally designed an all around waterproof case that deems worthy and equal to the amazing iPhone 4. A perfect match truely made in heaven. Lifeproof went above and beyond my expectations. Pros. Crystal clear screen that lays flush to the phone. No bubbles or newtons oil effect. Excellent response using the screen and apps. All the buttons work flawlessly and easy to press. Phone calls and playing music is awesome. The look and feel of the case is like no other made. Smooth sleek and easy to hold. The outer edge of the case has an amazing rubberlike grip that feels soo right in your hand. Still using my original lifeproof case for several months now. I can honestly say that I will never have to buy another case again. My case still looks brand new even after using my lifeproof flyfishing in the rivers and lakes in Montana and Colorado. Finally a case that can truely stand up to the challenges and adventures in our everyday lives weather your scuba diving., white water rafting or just going shopping at the mall. Lifeproof it just works.
This case is tough water proof dirt proof and it looks sweet if u dont have one u need to get one
Took a chance on this iPhone case and so glad i did. Conpletely waterproof. First time i took it in the pool people looked at me like I was crazy. Now they all want one. This case is awesome. No more worries. freedom to take your iphone anywhere. Hands down the best most complete protection for your iPhone
This case has it all light weight sleek and works! We took ours diving 12ft and got great videos ! they also come in pink and purple if you go to Lifeproof web page :) if you have an iPhone u must have a Lifeproof case
I originally had purchased the other "top brand" case but promptly returned it once I found the Lifeproof at Best Buy. The other case was too bulky and offered little or no protection to the speakers/mic/cameras. Lifeproof took care of those issues for me, plus it provides usage that no other case can. I don't have to concern myself about the status of my phone when I go to the beach or worry when I get caught in a rainstorm. No similar issues as mentioned in the earlier posts. If you watch the install and care videos then you shouldn't have a problem. This is the single best investment I have ever made for a product. I am overly satisfied with the level of protection it gives to my iPhone and thoroughly enjoy the comfort and peace of mind that goes with it. Check out their website, watch the videos, look on YouTube, read the reviews, and see for yourself. I did and I'm happy with the results!
I can't find one flaw with this case. Absolutely amazing! Nothing on the market matches or comes close to it. It's a must have! Well worth the money. Essential to anyone with a life, no matter how hectic. I can't recommend this case enough. Just get lifeproofed as soon as possible! :)
This case a little on the pricey side, well worth it ! I have had no screen issue like some people claim. I did take the time to watch the instructional videos. The case has a great feel to it very light weight all the buttons work fine volume buttons a little stiff. Sielent switch works great. The case does come with a head phone adapter. I will say this case is so much better than most out there. This will be the cases I buy for my iPhone 4.
The LifeProof cases delivered on everything it promised and then some. A waterproof case that never has to come off at the same time being sleek, sexy, and protective. No better protection for your investment.
I have had 4 of these cases for 3 months. This case is absolutely perfect. I have taken it swimming, taken videos underwater, listened to music underwater. Talked in the pouring rain on the phone. The phone is totally waterproof with all the phones functions. My screen protector has always sat flush with the screen with no gap. If anyones case has a gap, that gap with go away within a matter of days to a week of carrying it in your pocket. I have a 3 black and a white case. I use the black mainly and after 3 months of use it does not have a scratch on it. I am an auto mechanic and the case goes through serious hard useage. I am hard on it and like I said it does not have a scratch on it. For the life of me I cannot figure out what the people are doing with their phone to get scratches on it. The case is slick and slides right in and out of my pocket without sticking and pulling my pocket inside out. It gathers no lint like the other 2 big name brand cases, of which I had both and are now in a junk drawer. I have dropped the phone a few times with no damage to the case or the phone. I have never had any issue with anyone not being able to hear me. The camera and flash works even better than it does with the naked phone. The screen sensitivity matches that of the naked phone. I will NEVER EVER use any other case again. I wont buy a new phone unless LifeProof makes a case for it. They have impeccable customer support and will take care of you if you have any problems.
best case to protect your iphone4....and it's completely waterproof!!! I will never use another case again....
The case is advertised as waterproof and I believe it. It is smaller and lighter than the (other big name), and more expensive. It also advertises it is shockproof and I accept that, too. It is a solid piece of equipment. Once you get the IPhone it, it'll be tough to get it back out. Operationally, at least on mine, there is a gap between the case's cover and the phone's screen. It takes a firmer finger push especially near the edges. Bottom line, I like it, even with some quirks.
I've been waiting months for this case to be released for the iPhone 4 ever since I saw the initial video of the people using the iPhone under water while on the beach. There's no doubt that this case appears to be extremely durable, but it seems to be lacking in two major areas that I, personally, could not overlook. I purchased two of these cases yesterday (9/25/11) from my local Best Buy store, one for my wife and one for myself, and both of them are being returned tomorrow. The overall fit and finish of the case is very nice, and it has a very slim profile which is a very welcome feature with all the other "heavy duty" type cases sometimes doubling the size of the iPhone itself. One key note is that the Lifeproof case definitely adds some length to the iPhone. The bottom of the case (where the data port is located) is extended quite a bit I assume for waterproofing and durability, but just let it be known that it makes the phone noticeably longer. I'd say 1/2' or so. I purchased the black case for myself, and I immediately noticed that the back half of the case is hard plastic, and instantly shows scratches and scuffs. Using the "finger nail test" resulted in permanent marks that would not come off. I can only imagine that over time, the scratches would get worse and worse. My wife, on the other hand, got the white case and it didn't show any scratches at all. The front half of the case is a hard plastic but has a soft rubberized feel to it, which I like a lot. I suppose they left the hard plastic on the back to help slide easier in and out of your pocket, not sure. Okay, the two flaws that now have us returning the cases. The front of the case is basically one large built-in screen protector, which seems to be very well made like the rest of the case, except for one HUGE problem. To keep the case waterproof, yet still allowing you to hear sound from the speaker, they had to sandwich a rubber gasket between the screen protector and the phone itself, around the speaker hole area. This creates a "bulge" if you will, right by the speaker area which lifts the entire screen protector off the screen. By having this "gap" between the screen protector and the screen, doing things like........TYPING.......... becomes a bit of a daunting task, forcing you to have to actually push on the screen to get things to work instead of just lightly tapping. The Lifeproof website FAQ's mention this issue, and say that it's just air trapped between the screen protector and the screen, but after trying everything they say to fix the issue, nothing changed, nor do I see how it ever will. With the rubber gasket between the protector and the glass it will always have a gap. Problem #2: The data port. Like I mentioned previously, the case is longer than the phone itself, and it comes with a cover that snaps over the data port, which actually has a very nice feel to it with a very positive "click" when snapped closed, but the problem is that I have yet to find an aftermarket data/charging cable that fits in this port hole. It was clearly designed for the oem Apple data cable, and NOT aftermarket designs. I have a bunch of 6ft cables that I bought from various places, which include a locking mechanism that cannot be unlocked when using this case. The case is so deep in the data port area that the data plug itself actually goes partially inside the case. What this means is that if I plug in my locking cables, there's no way for me to unlock them to get them back out, and I'm not going to go out and re-buy a whole bunch of cables after spending $70+ on this case. My AT&T brand car charger won't even work anymore because the plug is too long. I was able to jam it in the hole, but I could see how repeated use of the charger would eventually damage either the charger or the case or both. In summary, the case itself is a great idea, and seems to do it's job well in regards to durability, but when it comes to practical use of the product, it falls short. After all, it's great to have a case that protects the phone in every way, but if you can't use the phone anymore, what's the point?? I'm returning the two I bought and will be putting the money toward a SquareTrade warranty instead.
Not too impressed. First of all, for those wanting to take your multi-hundred $$$ phone into the water for pictures and video, you're a dummy. Buy an underwater camera that is designed for that. Too many reviews about leakage. What I don't like particularly is that the screen does not lie flat so I have to push extra forceful to get it to register. Highly annoying. I don't have time for my phone to unresponsive. The mute (vibrate) switch also has to be pushed forcefully. I couldn't fit my charger into the port even after I took the back cover off. The back is a sort of plastic that doesn't give me that confident feeling that it will protect it much. The only thing that feels protective is the perimeter. The quality of sound is greatly reduced as well, by at least 50%. Too many irritating things for me to "settle" for it. I'm getting rid of it.
I have had this case for 6 months and loved it for about 2. I have developed a tear in the rubber that cover the volume on/off switch so my phone is no londer dirt and water proof. The holster which i boudht seperatelt for 35 bucks has broken twice. The pic that holds the clip has walked out of position and required me repair it so I dont lose my phone. Overall the Otter was better. I'm disappointed because I really liked it.
The case did work for a while. When plugging and unplugging the charger over time the case cracked. At least I took the phone out of the case at least twice a month to clean it and submerged it for testing otherwise I would have lost my phone.
I would like to shed some new light on the life proof case. I was also fooled by the amazing videos and advertisement life proof put out to sell there product. I bought mine like 2 months ago. followed the video instructions for the water test and so forth. I fell in love with this case. I thought this is the best case in the world. Then i kept hearing how the life proof case has failed and life proof will warranty the case but not the phone if damaged. Many people are fooled in the wording life proof has put out to think they will also warranty the phone. They do not. Since i bought the case i have never taken my phone out of the case. I use my phone everyday at the gym with earbuds. It is a Pain to remove the plug and put in the adaptor everytime but i figured its worth it, right. Not even two months of use the adaptor shorted out, makeing my earbuds useless at the gym. This was strick 1 against the life proof product. Then when people were telling me there phone got wet even in the case i decided to remove my phone for a test. Once i opened up the case i found dust inside. Not alot of dust but some. This is stike 2. I snapped the case back to gether with out my phone in it, screwed the head phone plug in and closed the charge port door. Pressed all around the case again to make sure everything was snapped together and sealed. I did the water test again to check to see after 2 months if my phone was still protected. I let it set in water for about 5 hours before taking it out. Once i pulled it out i found alot of water inside the case. Thank god my iphone was not in the case. I decided i would rather be extra carefull with my iphone around water and with out a case like this then to believe that the life proof case will protect my phone. Never again life proof will i trust your product to protect something that is worth so much money. $80.00 for not ever two months worth of use, Come on. Take your product off the market cause its worthless.
I had one. It failed. Called them and they said tough luck sucker and took NO responsibility even though I went through all the testing they suggested.
I have had the case for eight months. Today I accidentally washed my jeans with my Iphone in the Lifeproof case in the pocket.. The Lifeproof case failed completely and my phone is toast. If you are an outdoor person I would not depend on the Lifeproof case to keep your phone dry.
The case is a little bit expensive. But overall I would recommend it to my friends.
The main thing I do not like is the sound quality when trying to listen to music. I've used it underwater for pictures and video and it works great with no water damage to my phone so overall, it's a success. Gives me great security when I'm out in the rain or around a pool.
Case is great for people that keep dropping the phone on water and on the floor i recommend this if you want to protect your invement of 199.99
i haven't had any trouble with it so far. easy to take off and on if needed.
i used my phone in the pool like the prduct promotes and my iphone recieved water damage and when i contacted lifeproof they didnt honor their waranty on my iphone so now i have a case that doesnt work and a broken iphone!
I love my case. Since I haven't gotten the belt clip yet, I carry it in my back pocket without fear of breaking iPhone front glass. It could have a more durable front shield but that could interfere with overall function. It's sleek, slim, and light weight. Even looks nice, clean, and professional. Great accessory to protect my phone. I had just bought an OtterBox 2 weeks before I saw this and quickly changed cases much to my husbans's dismay. OtterBox is $50 which was pretty much wasted. I wouldn't trade the Life Proof for anything.
I bought this case to replace an otter box I've had for about a year. After about a month the waterproof membrane that covers the earpiece had torn. A few weeks after that the plug cover cracked rendering it useless, and now the case itself has developed a crack. It's not worth $20 let alone $80, very disappointed.
Tested case without phone and it was waterproof. Used in the pool not deeper than 3' and it worked fine for about a week. After a week it got wet #not submerged# and the phone wouldn't charge. Took it do Apple store and both moisture sensors were tripped red. I suggestion is it works good for rain but keep it on the table not near the pool.
I am an avid fisherman and waterfowl hunter. With a lot of time spent on the water, dealing with a cell phone is always a hassle. The idea of the LifeProof case was fantastic and it worked great for about the first 6 months. About 7 months into my ownership, the plastic pieces on the case began cracking. I did not abuse the case or drop it excessively. Any cracks in the case completely negated my reasoning for buying it--being waterproof. As a finance guy, the insurance is probably a better investment than this case, which is how I approached the decision. I knew the case wouldn't last forever, but expected it to last for more than a year, anyway.
The case completely protects the phone but in doing so also impacts the way the microphone you speak into works. In other words the case works so well that the microphone doesn't allow for callers to hear you - so the phone wont get damaged by the elements but it ends up making the phone useless to make calls. The way I would get callers to hear me was by unsnapping the bottom portion of the phone which opens up a channel to the speaker. This works but I could see this leading to the snapping piece becoming worn out. My brother in-law has this same case and wasn't experiencing this issue - may have been an issue with my product.
Very practical. Need $30 adapter purchased separately to work with docking station. With adapter spent over $100. Price needs to be lower.
I have had this case for about a month now and I love it. I had a defender by otter box before and it was bulky and broke on me. I only wish these cases were just a little less expensive.
Purchased to replace OtterBox case. Fits well, looks good. I was quite disappointed with the charger as it's difficult to plug in and remove charger for 4S.
this product was good, waterproof, durable but couldn't stand up to puppy teeth. i left my phone or case on the sofa for a few seconds and my pup made some good dents and pierced the screen. i was not able to return my product. also it does scratch easily.. but i liked it just that it was useless to me once my puppy pierced the case.
Saw the advertisement for this case in a fishing magazine and I thought it would be perfect for my frequent fishing trips because of the waterproof feature. Don't believe it! I tested it as recommended and watched the video as recommended and used it the way they said to. Only 2 months old, I had it it my pocket while wading. Took it out to take a picture and the lens was fogged. Tuurns out that water somehow got in and ruined my phone. Called Lifeproof and their service was horrible. The only thing they would do is send me another case which was useless since I had to buy another phone, IPhone 5, and the 4 case wouldn't fit anyway. It does not perform as advertise and the service is horrible so I would stay away.
I just purchased my case yeaterday. So far i have enjoyed using this lifeproof case. I gave this product 4 stars because the only complaints I have about it would be the sensitivity with the touch screen. It's not the easiest thing to use. You really have to practice using the case writing text messages and emails to get comfortable with it. The sound could be louder because the technology of the can funnels the sound to the of the case. It does sound muffled, you can however open the charge port door and the sound is very crisp again. I have already done numerous water tests as well as using it in the shower and it works just as described! I am very impressed. I am going to continue to use the case for the next few weeks to make sure I'm 100% satisfied. I have read the Q & A from lifeproof.com which indicates the screen should flatten completely in a week or so.
I have the Otterbox case and the Life Proof case! I like the Otterbox case and it's nice! But it's bulky and I would like to have my iPhone with me! Just in case I'm around water! You can't do that with the Otterbox case! But with the Life Proof case, it works PERFECTLY! I tried it underwater for 1 hour without the iPhone in it! After I submerged in the sink, the case was wet, but when I took the case apart, it was TOTALLY DRY! Not one drop of water inside the case! Now that's WATERPROOF! And I can finally take my iPhone to the beach and get it wet! Without damaging the iPhone! Lifeproof, your my LIFE SAVER! If you want a case to protect your iPhone, then the Life Proof case IS THE ANSWER!
I bought my iPhone 4S about 6 months ago and was researching cases. I stumbled upon this one and thought... GREAT A waterproof case will leave nothing to chance... Wrong I was! On the 4th of July I went to a pool party and thought that this was a great opportunity to use my case. I used it and everything was fine... until I started to go under water. I noticed condensation on the case and came out of the water. I opened it up and my phone was soaked and dead. Lucky I had insurance so I got a new phone... Lifeproof SUCKS!!!!!!!!! Don't get their cases you will regret it!.
I would buy it again without a doubt great product
It fell apart within a week! It was a complete waste of money! If you want to throw $40 down the drain buy this piece of Junk!! Great way to waste money!!
This things sucks!!! Te fabric on the sides started peeling within a few days. Now I have to walk around with a $40 case that looks like garbage!!
I had it for 3 weeks and the fabric all started coming off.
Did not fit my iphone 4 at all! It was too long. Case extended a good inch and a half above my phone.
Great case. Not too bulky and it does not take away from the phone's look. Easy to withdraw and insert to/from holster without struggling.
I have owned a thunderbolt, samsung galaxy nexus both of which I have purchased platinum series case/ covers for ( very nice!..purchased this case for my iphone4s on 8/24/12 and once again platinum series delivers great results.. Form fitting, light weight and does not take away from the natural feel of the iPhone when in your hand.
This was a great case for me for about 6 months, then the belt clip broke. Pretty worthless now.
This is a great holster for the lifeproof iphone case. Phone fits in either front facing or rear facing for more protection.
Nice for a short time. To much money for a clip A cheap made one at that
It's very durable. Not overly comber some. Only problem I have is you can't charge your phone while it's still on the clip.
I use this belt clip on a daily basis. I work hard and play harder, and the Lifeproof case is the perfect amount of durability and sleekness. The belt clip is a great accessory as it enables you to use your lifeproof in a more professional setting. The belt clip is extremely durable, doesnt damage the case like some clips can, and when locked, you literally cannot "shake" the phone from the clip, and even when unlocked, it is still very strong at holding onto the phone. The only thing I don't like about the clip is the fact that once you install one of the sized clips, it will be permanent. It is understood that you need it to be permanent, but it would be nice to be able to swap the clips out for different situations.
Very durable and secures the phone very well. I love the locking feature and that it lets you pick the size of the belt clip. I prefer my Lifeproof case and clip over the Otter box.
A disappointment. Easy to remove phone from cradle one handed, but not easy to replace one handed. If not locked in place properly phone falls out.
This belt clip fulfills all of my expectations. It is study, strong and well-built. The phone (even in its LiteProof case) fits snugly in the holster and can be placed so either the face of the phone faces out or the back faces out. [I turn my phone so the back faces out for protection of the phone face. Of course, that is probably not necessary because of the construction of the LiteProof iPhone case, which protects the face of the phone.] The one drawback is that the clip is a bit pricey but it works like a charm and I would recommend it to anyone. One word of caution to buyers of the belt clip. It comes with two clips; one of wide belts and one for narrow belts. Make sure you know which you want to use because once the clip is attached to the holster, you can't change it. The instructions point this out but it is worth mentioning again.
I had this case for about two-three weeks. I must admit that I do put my phones through the ringer and this case did do a great job of protecting my iPhone. My problem with it though is after only a couple of weeks the fabric on the bottom of the case started to fray and the glue that held the fabric on had dried up. Subsequently, the strip of fabric that runs up the side of the case had come off. In terms of practicality, it kept my phone together just fine. Speck makes fine products but just stay away from the ones with fabric. Another pet peeve, and this is based on preference, the apple on the back isn't visible with this case.
I would like to first start by saying that this case is form maximum protection, so it is not a slim sleeve. The majority of slim cases offer no protection if your phone is dropped. This case is exceptional and is built well. It is easy to grip and does not feel like it will fall out of your hands. The built in screen protector is awesome an extremely responsive. Additionally, Otterbox stands behind their products. This is a great case for those wanting to protect their iPhone. This case looks great and while it does add some bulk to the phone, it is not gaudy. My least favorite part of this case is the clip, but I have gotten use to it. I do not put my phone in my pocket. I would rather wear it. The built in screen protector is amazing. For those who have yet to experience the fun of putting on a Zagg or like protector, I would recommend this case. Since it is built into the case, you do not need to worry about air bubbles. It really is amazing. Features: Three layers of protection Complete interaction of the device's functions Ratcheting belt clip holster included Material: Clear protective membrane on touch screen High-quality polycarbonate shell Durable silicone skin I would also recommend the Otterbox Commuter or Reflect or Ballistic SG for those looking for a smaller case, but still wanting protection. Remember that your key points of protection are the 4 corners of the case. These are your points of impact usually when dropped. You want to make sure that you have something to absorb the shock. Lastly, while fashion is something we all want, remember to think about protecting your investment. That is what a "good" case will do.
I have gotten this case for Christmas, and am loving every second of owning this case! It comes with a built-in screen protector, ad well as 2 levels of impact protection. The only thing this is not, is water-proof. Well, that's why there is the life-proof case. The case is a little over priced, but still good. If I were you, a case that is really worth EVERY PENNY of your hard earned money, get the mophie juice pack air. But all and all, this case is great.
I went to bestbuy to get this phone and the salesperson was very helpful. He explained all the prepaid plans to me and the phones they carry. I had Optimus v from lg and had pretty much done my homework beforehand, i was thinking about evo 4g or iPhone. Since there is no 4g in my usage area, and I also have a Samsung Infuse from work, I decided to take iPhone 4s. I like the simplicity of the iOS, which is stable, smooth and fast on iphone 4s, yet miss the customization , file system access and deep apps integration in Android. I find text very sharp, clear and easy to read on the iPhone. I do wish the screen to be bigger, it looks small next to my infuse. I also personally love the super amoled plus screen more than the retina display on iPhone. When I watch a video, super amoled plus display looks like a mini plasma tv that is able to show true black color, though some may find their colors cartoonish. That said, iPhone 4s does have great color accuracy and holding and using it feels natural with one hand. The cameras are great, the flash isn't the best which is very understandable. I do not like the glass back at all, I would rather have a less fragile phone, but a case can help. Battery life is not so great, but there are many added on battery cases out there. Overall I like the iPhone 4s on virgin mobile, I find the price high for the phone, but this is a lot better than having a contract. Setting up the phone was easy, virgin mobile has a very easy to use website. Data speed isn't fast, yet listening to pandora is not a problem. Voice calls are good for my area too.
When I got the phone the best buy salesman told me he had to set it up and I would get a different number which I did not want to do. So I let him do it. Then he told me it was all set up. I went home and could not get it to work then I went on line to my virgin account re registered the phone, and guess what it worked with my old number!!! Maybe sales people should just give the phone to existing virgin customers and let them set up there own phones???
My mother was really tired of paying $130 a month on a carrier for unlimited everything, After doing some reasearch and convincing my mother not to resign up for another two year's and go prepaid. I was happy to see the iphone 4s come to Virgin Mobile, I told her you will save a lot of money. We were able to get her number ported over from a Big Carrier to Virgin Mobile but it was a all night thing due to error with a best buy worker not paying attention to the correct phone number to port, but was quickly corrected, we waited all day and could not figure out why it was still not activated. Finally my mother decided to call customer service, while she was on the phone with customer service. Their was info on how to get it activated and here is my major tips for you guys: 1. If your phone is on : Do a Factory Reset , PS Make sure you write down your contact's 2. Make sure you are connected to Wifi Network, Use your own wifi 3. Complete the steps to get your iphone activated and running this is the easy part 4. when done and at your home screen if you only see bar's but no 3g, turn your phone off completely , wait 10 second's and power it back on 5. and Finally Wait Patiently it may seem like it did not work if it says ( Searching or No Service ) Give it at least 15 min's it should show the carrier name VIRGIN , tower bar's and 3g After all this was done my mother went from a iphone 4 black on a carrier to Virgin Mobile Iphone 4s in White She loves it so much from Call quality, to ease of use, its much more zippy than her last Iphone and With unlimited Talk, Text and Web for only 50 buck's a month if you set up Auto pay plus tax My last statement: The whole reason for getting a nice phone is to beable to make call's , use application's, text, MMS, browse the web and more with no Issues, Trust me on this Apple Make's the best quality Smartphone and Set's the bar way high and excell's , you will not reget it
After being a heavy Android user over that years. I need a phone that could help me with reminders and information. Decided to jump on the iPhone 4S before the iPhone 5 was released. SIRI is my god send. Not accurate, but with use over time. The back end server will improved. It is just like going to school. We had to learn and learn to get that degree. Virgin Mobile is a bargain with cheap phone plans and use of the Sprint Network. I do not go over the 2.5GB data limit. on 3G data. Thought it was foolish to pay extra 10.00 for Sprint 3G data. Now my bill is at a nice 54.00 every month. Unlimited minutes and text. Sprint was over 100.00 for the same phone. Verizon and AT&T even more. Downside was paying full price for iPhone and not having unlock capabilities.
Love having an iphone through Virgin Mobile -- the monthly charge can't be beat even if the upfront charge is more for the phone. I figure we'll come out ahead in about 8 months. On the down side, the 16gb is not big enough to hold all my music and games but I was able to weed through alot of my music. The battery doesn't make it through more than 1.5 days but all in all loving this phone!!
Virgin Mobile is one of the first prepaid providers to offer the iPhone 4S, and at a cost of $649, it isn't for the casual shopper. However, Virgin's monthly plan of $35 for unlimited data (2.5GB of which are up to 4G speeds) and unlimited texts plus 300 minutes cannot be beat, and undercuts contract iPhone plans by nearly $50 a month, so that is where the long-term savings will come into play. Virgin Mobile runs off of Sprint's network, so that means great coverage in major cities and on major highways, but spotty coverage in many rural areas. The phone's performance is just like other iPhones on other providers so you basically know what you are going to get with that as Virgin's model is identical.
I was with AT&T and then with Verizon. With each company I had a 400 or 450 minute plan with texting and data. In total after an employee discount from a organization I worked with my bill was $85 or $90 a month. (without tethering) With a 2 year commitment required that means I would pay $2040 for service and $250 to $350 for the phone. I found that with AT&T they charge a activation fee or an upgrade fee for the first month. So the $200 is the "come on" and after their activation and/or upgrade fee the total was $50 more before tax. Total for 2 years $2290. Virgin Unlimited is $53 (with the bill charged to your credit card automatically-including tax) so for 2 years the service is $1272 add the iphone cost of $700 total is $1972. Thing is i didn't ever get close to using the phone 500 minutes a month. So I have a plan that is $42 a month for 1200 total minutes total for 2 years including phone $1710 or a $500 savings and if after a year and 1/2 I want a new iPhone I can buy a new one and not have to pay a penalty. That freedom speaks loads. Sprint service on the iPhone is better than what I was getting on my HTC with Verizon or Samsung my roommate had with AT&T. Yes the internet is only 3g, but I haven't had any problems with not having any internet which was a constant problem on the HTC phone with Verizon even after they replaced the phone twice. I did but a Mobi Juice Pack air so I have extended battery life (no it's not as dainty as the phone without the extra battery, but the battery slides on and off easily so if I don't need the extra battery life for a night out I just slide it off) In my car the bluetooth quickly connects and with so many options and SIRI it's wonderful. I love to ask it questions that are simple but any other computer wouldn't be able to handle. Like "Do I need to take an umbrella today?" and it will tell you that it is or isn't likely to rain. Even though IOS is starting to look dated it's still the easiest to navigate. My only thing that I miss from android is the time and weather widget. But..... making a call, texting, or syncing with a computer is so much easier and easier with the iPhone that I don't miss it "that much" and my phone doesn't freeze.
love my new iphone. i like the cheaper monthly cost. speed is ok ( i' always connected to my wifi)
I bought this phone after being a Virgin Mobile customer for 8 years thinking that this was going to be the answer to all of my smartphone dreams on a prepaid network. I was so wrong and my dream became a nightmare. I used the phone for about a week in full functioning order. After that, I was not able to use the 3G network or Wifi for downloading anything. A smartphone is useless without these functions. Then I went back to Best Buy multiple multiple times to figure out what was wrong. I went through 3 iPhones from Virgin and each one worked less and less on their network until I had an iPhone that couldn't even connect to cell service at all. The Best Buy workers were very confused as to why this was happening but said that I was not the first one who had come back with major problems. I got to a point of serious frustration with the iPhone and the terrible tech support provided by Virgin that I returned the phone. Being without a phone for two weeks and have their tech people tell me there was nothing they could do to help me was not ok with me. It didn't seem like they were even aware that Virgin sells an iPhone and were no help in trying to get it fixed. Lets just say this was the last frustrating issue I'm willing to go through with Virgin and am planning to switch to a real cell phone company at the soonest time possible. DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE AND DO NOT START UP A NEW ACCOUNT WITH VIRGIN. It will only bring you frustration and head aches.
I wanted a case that had a way to easily clip the phone on my belt. This is perfect. I only need to use the clip when I want it clipped on my belt, otherwise it is a normal case. My husband's iPhone case has a plastic button over the power button on the top that lets you power off the screen. That would be handy on this case. But overall, I really love the case. The color is perfect (it comes in other colors) and the matte finish on the case does not collect fingerprints - looks very nice.
I really love this case for my iPhone. After trying out others, this one is different. It feels really good in your hands and is not slippery. Stays on your phone too. Also very thin but sturdy so fits in my handbag pocket easily. Definitely recommend!
After only a week of having the Platinum case with holster it came apart from where it snaps together and my BRAND NEW iPhone 4s fell out of it, denting it in the corner. From then on it kept coming apart. I returned it to the store and got a skin for my iphone 4s instead. I loved that it had a holster but needs to be better made where the case divides in two and snaps together. They need to make a snap button for it or make it all one piece. Regret ever buying it!!!!
Not worth the cost. EVO has much more functionality. Only 4s benefit is ability to use as iPod.
Pros: This phone is fast and as many apps as I have added, it still holds up the speed. This makes a great team with other Mac products. Not only do I sync music, but I also sync emails, iCal, and stream wirelessly to my MacBook Pro. The 8 MP camera takes great photos and videos in Hi-def 720p. The past month, I have been getting use to Siri which has been handy and time efficient. Cons: I have a small crack in the corner. Right now, I have an otter box protecting it. When doing A LOT of texting or web surfing, the battery lasts only about 6 hours, otherwise it can last a day and half. Sometimes I wish it had 4G, and Sprint isn't the BEST service; however, I do like having unlimited data. Overall: This phone is great. With the exception of 4G, I like it more than the Galaxy S3, and EVO 4G LTE. I would recommend an iPhone to a friend, but I would also recommend to wait till the next model as I assume it will release before the end of the year and it will enable 4G,
I made the right choice. It has been very useful for all my needs.
Where to start? I am trilled with this phone! I have an iPad, and have had several iPods, so I was familiar with how to use it, which made it a lot easier for me. I had 2 Samsung Galaxies before this phone, so I'm still no used to such a small screen but that is really the only complaint that I have. The camera is Awsome. The speed at which the programming works is outstanding. I am an over the road truck driver, so I'm all over the country and the call quality Is better than most. I do wonder why Sprint didn't ask that it be made 4G compatible though?
Great phone in every way a phone should be. You already know great interface and great apps. Only thing I would have like is lte for when that is available but honestly having had 4g in evo before have found sprint 3G to be more the adequate for what I do and haven't missed the sometimes faster speeds of the clear wire network.
Once you go iPhone....you never go back! I love it!
I havent had the iphone that long but so far so good. I am very happy with it. So much better than the androids. I would definatly pass along that everyone should have a Iphone.My Mom Can't wait for the iphone 5 to come out.
Best Buy was running a promotion. Renew your phone and get $50 gift card. I was able to apply to purchase of the iPhone 4s. Phone has been working great. no issues.
With just my everyday to day life, I feel the iphone surpasses all other phones. Very fluid moving from app to app and its compatibility with all and most accesorries is in comparison to none!! TEAMiPhone...just wish it was 4G!
well it is easy to use it, it is the perfect size if you like to have it in your pocket i like it but if you don't have a Wi-Fi connection is way too slow and more when you want to watch a video or download an app also brousing is slow.
Best phone ever, blows away android phones... Love this phone
Beats the heck out of my previous Android phones! I love all the Apps that are available...they're so much better than Android as well.
Having used a Pre, and several Droids, I finally made the switch to the Iphone. So far, I love the phone. I am disappointed that a $50 gift card is now available, I should have waited or it should be offered for this upgrade.
The transition to the iPhone 4S from an HTC II windows-based phone was so easy I could hardly believe it. And the iPhone 4S is far superior in every way. I'm so glad I didn't settle for one of the lesser phones. This phone is worth the money. It's so easy to work with that even my senior husband can use it, something impossible with the HTC II. Apple, thank you so much for putting me in a new dimension..
I love the speed of the iphone. I really like the usefullness of all the apps. The one thing I don't like is the fact that even though I bought Apple products (iphone, 2 itouches, many ipods, ipad, multiple itunes apps and music, etc.), I still have to pay to icloud my apple devices together. Plus, a large number of apps I used to have on my evo android that were free, cost money to get them for Apple. If it weren't for those items, this would be a 5 star.
I have an Iphone 4S and bought this new one for my daughter as an upgrade. Seeing she has had several Ipods and Itouches and a Macbook Pro she is very comfortable with using this phone and is very happy with it. Her Mom has an Android HTC EVO and my daughter is constanly helping her with and says the Android is a pain.
This is the greatest phone I've ever owned and I've had at least 15 cellphones in my time. When you buy a Blackberry it comes with a manual the size of a college text book. The Iphones instruction manual is a double sided pamphlet that can be read in 10 minutes cover to cover. What I'm amazed by is how easy this phone is to use. Siri is ok, doesn't impress me all that much. Camera is great, very impressive! This phone has cost me so much money because I'm now an Apple user for life. Purchased a Mac Pro Laptop 2 weeks after my Iphone purchase! Enjoy, you'll love it. I've read some negative reviews about this product but most had to do with availability issues. The other complaint was that it is glass and can break. Really? No kidding, buy a protective case! I've dropped mine twice already and it keeps on ticking!
This is a wonderful product. Sleek design with stunning features. Feels very solid in one's hand.
I have owned all 5 iPhones and each one keeps getting better. They add features that seem like something ahead of their time or things you might not want or need. I wasn't sure if Siri and slightly improved specs were enough to upgrade from the iPhone 4. But once you get comfortable using Siri you will use it on an almost daily basis. The phone is super fast and blow away thoswe Android phones that need to be reset every couple days to ensure they keep running. I haven't turned my iPhone 4s off in over a month and it's still running as fast as the day I took it out of the box! I had an Android phone and needed anti-virus and app-killing apps. The iPhone suffers from neither of those issues and is the most user-friendly product on the market. If you have common-sense you can figure out how to use Apple products quickly. I had my Android for 3 months and still didn't understand how to do some simple tasks. Apple products may cost slightly more than the competition but it's worth the cost. -No virus issues -No slowdown in performance based on how many apps you have open or length of time since last reset -Great accessories (Apple TV, wireless printing w/ HP, wireless sync, iTunes store# -Biggest app store -One operating system with easy upgrades #Anroid has 2.2, 2.3, 3.2, 4.0 and it's difficult to upgrade when a new version comes out and some companies don't offer upgrade ability)
My iphone completely gave up on life after less than a month. Aside from the obvious product failure complaint, I don't like the fact that the iphone 4s doesn't link with my car's bluetooth system (2011 Chrysler 300 with UConnect.) I don't think the iphone is any better than my previous android phone. I honestly regret purchasing it.
They just released it and its already behind the curb apple should get things ahead before releasing their phones
This is the product Apple has been striving for all these years: elegant, intuitive, a perfect blend of form and function that fits nicely in the hand and dazzles the eye and the mind with tons of 21st century features. SIRI, especially, is a lady with whom both you AND your wife will be having an affair! The list of ways in which she can make your life easier will amaze and delight you - from finding a gas station or hotel to retrieving and replying to your messages on the run to playing your favorite songs on command - SIRI will be your new best friend. GREAT phone, discovering new ways to use and enjoy it every day.
I had been wavering between the Galaxy S2 and this for weeks before release. I'm 100% sure I made the right choice. The androids may have better specs, but the iPhone 4S is just silky smooth to operate. I've had a droid phone before but I'm never going back. There is nothing like an operating system that is made for a specific phone. This what makes this thing run so well. Plus the size is perfect (not a Zack Morris phone feel in the hands). The app store beats the heck out of the droid market for high quality apps. Not to mention tons of free quality apps. The camera is one of the best I've seen and Siri is amazing. The only negative on the phone is no 4G network. But let's face it, if you have Sprint, that won't matter for long. Sprint is building its own 4G LTE network for 2013. This means all the 4G sprint phones now wonthave 4G functionality either due to different (WiMax) hardware. And by then we will all be getting new phones anyways. My only regret was not getting the 64GB model. 32GB is a lot but I have a 4100 song, 20 movie library. So I've had to cut out 1500 songs and 15 movies. Still plenty. And this gives me enough room for the 45 free apps I have and 5 paid apps (which were only $1 each). Get this phone, you won't regret it. P.S. I had no problem rolling into my local Best Buy on Oct . 18th and picking one of these up without a pre-order. Guess inventory problems vary by region.
Got some advice for best buy.. Don't take pre-orders without knowing your inventory. Even if it is big shot apple...They started fulfilling their orders earlier than best buy did, so "We dont know how many we are going to get" is poor and unacceptable statement from your employees.
I was desparately wanting to switch from Android to Apple, as my HTC Evo 4G was running like an old dog. I was constantly needing to reboot it all the time, and that was like a 10 minutes process. I'm so happy I made the change. Now if only Sprint can get both voice and data working together.
I finally took the leap from do nothing flip phone into the twenty first century.. This phone has been a pain free jump. My daughter now looks at me in disbelief when she tries to show me something Ive already learned.
I was on the AT&T network and moved to Sprint. I have had no issues at all with my phone on the Sprint network. At the office I constantly stream audio from SiriusXM, it's great.
I've had my case much longer than my new phone thanks to delayed shipping. The case looks great. Very easy to put the phone into verses similar designed/priced cases. However now that my phone is finally here I'm afraid the case has to go back. Though it says compatible with 4/4s it's not fully. There is no access for the vibrate switch just above the physical volume controls. For meetings I will either have to take the phone out of the case to flip the switch or hope that by turning the volume down and changing some settings hope that I can make the phone quiet enough. It would be a great case if there was access to all of the external, physical features.
This case looks great, I am sure it does a good job of protecting your phone. Problem is you can't use your phone while in this case. It covers the speaker so you can't hear. The case also makes it impossible for you to plug in your headphones while using. It is bulky and did not fit easily into the holster. I had the case for about 24 hours before returning.
best phone I ever owned easy to use easy to understand all features I love it!
Phone was a gift and recipient loves it. However she is already on her second one because the battery didn't last entire days before it was discharged. Today on the new phone had only 35% left after about 5 hours with little use -- No internet use and only a couple calls and some look-up of lists like to-do tasks and grocery list. Probably have to exchange it again. I heard that this is a common problem with the iPhone. Otherwise it has so many uses that everything you do can be in this one device in your pocket.
I am a big fan of Apple portable products. Great phone!
I PHONE 4S IS GREAT LOVE THE SERI. I-PHONES ARE FAR SUPERIOR TO ALL OTHERS AND MILES AHEAD AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE. BEST BUY OFFERED 230 DOLLAR GIFT CERTIFICATE FOR MY I PHONE ----WHICH I COULD USE FOR THE PURCHASE OF THE NEW PHONE WHICH COST 199 DOLLARS. THIS IN EFFECT PROVES THE VALUE OF A USED I PHONE. I CHOSE TO SELL IT ON EBAY AND GOT 350 DOLLARS FOR IT BECAUSE IT WAS IN PERFECT SHAPE SINCE I KEPT A CONVER ON IT AND A SHEER LAMINATED SCREEN PROTECTOR. CANT BEAT THAT!!!!!!!
Nice phone - Just plain works!! - Would purchase again!!
Amazing phone other than the battery runs down very quickly.
This phone is the best. iPhone can only get better
I had been debating on getting an iPhone for years and finally took the plunge and bought one for me and my wife. I can honestly say i don't know how i went this long without an iPhone. The Best Buy Mobile store was great to work with and answer all of my smartphone questions and got both phones setup in less than an hour and transferred all information from our old phones. My wife's phone had some problems the 1st week and wasn't able to make or receive phone calls - bad SIM card - but they were able to fix it quickly. I went back and forth between the $.99 3GS, the $100 4, and the $200 4s - i'm glad i bought the 4s. I needed a 4 or 4s b/c i wanted Facetime since i travel for work and have kids at home; Facetime is great.....wish i didn't have to have a wifi connection for it, but that makes sense. The 4s was worth the extra $100 for Siri and the phones ability to type text messages and other things just by talking and the other upgrades from the 4 - it's faster. The camera on the phone is great! i wish i would have known i was going to buy this phone a few months ago and i wouldn't have bought a new point and shoot camera b/c this thing is just as good. Great for taking pictures and videos of my kids. The iCloud service is also a big plus - backs up all my pictures, apps, and other phone information and the first 5GB is free. Overall, great phone and love how easy it is to use the app store and the overall use and functionality of the phone. My wife's not that tech savy - i still have to sync her ipod for her - and she is able to use this phone with no problem.
There is some disadvantages. But overall its a good device. Thank you!
Sure Siri is fun and useful for reading text while driving. I really don't use it as much as I thought. My spouse went with an HTC and I am really not sure I would not go that direction next time. We will see when the OSi 6 comes out this fall. Also Android market has a lot more free apps. I love face timing with my granddaughter!
I will never go back to a droid after having my iPhone!
Has everything I need in one package. I wish the battery lasted longer and had a smart memory...taking itself off charge when done charging. Oh...and would like to see a sd slot.
This is the best phone I have ever had! Love it! It's reliable, fast, easy to use, and smart (well, Siri isn't so smart). An awesome camera and video.
Super smartphone, best I've had compared to prior iphones and other smartphones previously. Better sound, picture and features.
I upgraded from the iPhone 4. Suri is great . Loving my phone.
Overall it is a great phone. I think my problem is more with the service than anything else. I would totally recommend the IPHONE 4, in white of course!
Greatest phone on the planet. Droids are light years behind this phone.
This is by far the best phone I've ever owned. It's really easy to use- I didn't even need the manual. I love the face time feature since my family lives 3000 miles away!! I also love how once I've logged into a wireless network, the next time I go back to that spot, the phone automatically rejoins that network.
Had this phone for a few weeks and sold it to a friend in favor of the Lumia 900. I need a phone that keeps me organized and this phone didn't seem to do the trick. This phone actually messed up my Outlook calendar. I would not recommend anyone use this phone for organizational purposes.
Its great and i love my phone.Features,App,Touchscreen
I have had the Iphone since they first came out and have had every model from that point on. I think Siri is hilarious and that alone was worth the upgrade.
Great size, weight is very minimal. All functions of the phone work greatly, from running apps to gaining access to the net. Camera features are easy, and downloading pictures and music are a snap. The only thing I really wish they would work on is the ability to upgrade the memory in the iPhone without having to upgrade the entire phone. Other than that, this really is an excellent smart phone.
Switched to the iPhone from an android, actually owned 3 androids prior. The iPhone is the smoothest running phone yet! No force closes with apps, works every time flawlessly. The battery life is amazing, all my droids killed the batteries so quickly. I could easily go 2 days without charging now. FaceTime is great and fun to use. Love the iCloud and auto backups. So many times before I had to reset my phones and lost everything. I couldn't be happier.
This new phone makes my wife so happy with all its' new apps and the Siri is great! She can talk her notes and make list while on the fly. How can you beat that. Easy to use. I started to take the new gallaxy 2 back and get another iphone, but I am good with this new skyrocket.
I would tell anyone that I just love this phone. Love the Siri function of this phone. Some of the things it comes up with puts a smile on your face.
This phone is awesome and I love it. Siri is awesome and is so cool.
I would not do without my iphone. Everything you could ever want.
I waited a long time to get this phone, and so happy I didnt wait any longer! It does everything I had expected from a smartphone.
I had the iPhone 4 previous and thought it was the best phone. Then came iPhone 4s and changed my mind. The best feature is Siri, she has helped me out so much. The colors are more vibrant and pop out at you on everything. I love how you can talk and look something up at the same time. Five Stars!!!
I have been a droid owner for years, HTC,HTC2, motorola. The htc is a good phone had no problems with it. The iPhone blows all of these out of the water. No problems with it at all. If you are thinking about an iPhone don't hesitate you won't be disappointed. It runs smoother than any droid phone out there and siri is amazing. P.S. goes great with my iMac. No problem with at&t service at all, coming from verizon i was a little surprised.
If you don't have one you wouldn't understand... hmmm seems that didn't qualify as a review. Maybe these extra words will help because that's all I have to say about it
Love my iPhone 4S. Does what it is supposed to do and Apple seems to keep up with new updates frequently. Apps are great and the most important thing, they can be trusted to do what they say.
Very pleased with my iphone 4S & very satisfied with the Customer Service with the purchase.
phone at this best buy selling to customer is no ggoooooddd at all...
The new Iphone 4s is the best phone I have ever owned! I switched from Android to the Iphone and I love the app store and the capabilites of the Iphone. The battery life is great. It lasts easily all day and if I don't play games for more than a couple hours I can make it last two days. The camera resolution is phenomenal and the HD screen is beautiful and exceptionally clear. I love how fast the phone is between switch apps and loading different programs or screens. I think I am an Iphone user for life!
this is an overall great buy for apple lovers. its easy to navigate with good options for professional and personal use. siri is a great concept but has trouble being used during road time because of network. or she says i cant understand you. this has been disappointing.
Few negatives: Can't have numerous aps open at once...on my old Palm, I could have many different things open at once. Sari doesn't always work The Iphone has not worked well with my 2012 My Touch...I get many complaints when I call people in the car Positives: Great App options When Sari works, it's great I like the Voicemail set up Easy to view and open my emails Great calendar features...I like that I can invite others to events Many great features to be honest...hard to list them all
It's an iPhone. It's got all the great features that iPhones have. But the battery just does not last. It takes one day for the battery to lose it's charge. I don't have too many apps installed, and I've only had it for a couple of weeks.
I love Seri and I was worried about not having a keyboard but with the auto correct and the talk texting feature it works out well. I love it. Don't like not having the normal smiley faces but when someone has an Iphone as well you can send emoticons... I am so happy I got this phone.
I bought this as an upgrade from a 3GS. The camera and speed are significantly better on the 4S. Siri is a definite plus. The speaker randomly has a crackling sound. From scouring the Internet, it looks like there isn't a fix. Since it's only randomly (and honestly, pretty quiet), I'm not going to attempt to send it in with the chance that I will get one that is worse. I was disappointed that the representative at Best Buy didn't tell me about the $36 AT&T upgrade fee. Since I wasn't charged it the day I bought the phone, I didn't realize I would have to pay it to AT&T later.
Great phone. This is my 3rd iPhone and it gets better every time! It does seem to have a shorter batter time than others.
Sweet! Got a Life Proof Case with it and it has help a lot!
I love the IPhone 4S, especially the multitude of functions.
I don't have a ton of apps added, but so far it's really fast to navigate around on the phone, pull up maps, browse the internet, etc. The picture quality is really clear. Face time works well. I've noticed when I dock it in my player for listening to music, that seems to mess up the network settings - easy to fix, but not ideal to have to fix it each time. The battery life also seems short, but I'm not sure if that's just because I'm using it more since it's so fast. =)
I bought this for the wife and couldn't be happier. She has MS and using Siri is a HUGE help to her. Sometimes she's too weak to do stuff and this is a second set of hands for her. We bought it a week ago and it already has 4G built in. It's not that fast as TV has lead us to believe but it's nice nevertheless. Super fast processor with a brillaint screen...Apple has done it again!!
I am overall happy with my new iPhone 4GS. I upgraded from the 3GS so I was already familiar with the phone itself. The speed is much faster and has some new features like Siri, which is very cool. I am still disappointed with the battery life. I usually charge it every day but it is worth it, it is a great product!
The thing I love most about the phone is the dual antenna; This feature gives you not only better coverage but maintains voice calls a lot better! Siri of course is always an added feature and with the new 5.1 update she's even more reliable.
iPhone is easy to use but it has a lot of bugs to work. I never had this trouble with my iPhone 3G
Great phone, love Siri, can't get enough of it!!! It's the coooooooooolest! Apple strikes again.
When i first got my Iphone 4s, I thought that it was going to be just like any other smart phone, not knowing about all the features the phone includes. As I turned on my iphone, the first thing that caught my eyes was the beautiful retina display. It looked HD and was stunning. As I scrolled through the organized main menu, I found some attractive apps. Apps such as Siri, texting HD camera really shocked me. The phone included many cool games also such as Temple Run, which was one of the best games I have ever played on a mobile phone. The value of this phone is phenomenal and should be worth a fortune. Thank you Apple for making this phone start at a price of $200. If I was the creator of the Iphone, I would've put a starting price of $500 or even more. It's the best phone in the world!!!!!
I am so glad I held onto my 3gs & missed the 4. This was so worth it!!
I have had this phone for a little over a month now and I absolutely love it! Traded up from an iPhone 3g and the speed difference is incredible. This phone is fast, easy to use, and SIRI has made my life easier :)
This phone is sleek and I would have to say my favorite. The signal is better than my other iPhones. The camera is good except for the flash gives red eye. Battery life is great!!! Other than that it's a good phone.
The iPhone 4S is an excellent product...high rez screen, quality camera, bluetooth, and a many quality apps available. I enjoy products that are well designed and work without issues. This iPhone was purchased for my wife, a very non-technical person - and what does she think about it ? She loves it! We've cancelled our landline now and are using only our iPhones. Another high point is the seamless integration between our Macbooks, iPad, and iPhone - everything works great together. By the way, if you have a mac or windows pc & iPad or iPhone, I would highly recommend an app called 1Password for password security/synchronization across all your devices.
i love everthing about the iphone 4s but the screen, if it had a screen the size of the htc evo , i would like it alot better. when i look things up on the internet it's hard to see the page and when i zoom in then it's too big for the screen. other then the size of the screen i love the way it works, i don't have any dropped calls or open any apps . the battery last a long time, i don't have to charge it everyday like i did my evo.
This is my first smartphone. Kelly, the BestBuy rep, recommended the iPhone because her parents found it easy to use. She was certainly right. Did not know how to delete apps so I asked Siri how to delete an app and she provided me with the instructions. Wanted the number of calories in a turkey/avocado sandwich. Siri gave me the information when I asked her. Also, using the iCloud to download pictures taken on my iPhone to my PC. No problems so far. Sending text messages is easy but I need more time to get accustomed to the keyboard. My fat fingers keep pressing the wrong key.
My personal opinion, iPhone is the best smartphone. iPhone 4S is much faster than 3GS. With Face Time app, you can do live video chat with other people on iPhone 4, 4S and iPad.
A good buy but the insurance here is pricey. Best Buy should consider giving a one time price for insurance as do its competitors.
several of my friends have the iphone. I kept reading up on it. Playing with my friends. I already had an ipod touch with a Ihome. So I decided on the iphone 4S. LOVE IT. I know there is so much more this phone can do that I haven't learned, or do not understand the lingo for it. Wishes there was a tutitorial for the phone. Would love an hour class or somehting. But I am loving it. and I see where someone who is a business owener could use this for everything. my only regret is maybe I should've waited for the iphone 5!!!!
I love my new iPhone the only thing I noticed was that Siri has difficulty understanding most of the things I say but I guess that will be improved. Other than that this phone is incredible.
Apple is at the top with iPhone 4s, no complaints at all with product.
I love my phone, this is my second iPhone and I would recommend an iPhone to any and everyone.
LOVE THE PHONE , COULD NOT IMAGINE BEING WITHOUT. KEEPS EVERYTHING ORGANIZED , VERY USER FRIENDLY
This phone is obviously nice. It's convenient and helpful, but it glitches so much. It constanty deletes my contacts, goes black for no reason, and a lot of my music doesn't work. I put it on my iphone from my ipod, and i had to put a lot of the music on twice because it wouldn't play. I don't know if my phone is just defective, but there are all kinds of glitches, and the battery isn't great. I have to charge it every night.
My first iPhone and it was definitely worth it. I got the regular 4 for christmas but wanted Siri so I upgraded to the 4S and haven't regretted it since. Excellent versitility and ease of use. The batter does run down much faster than I am use to but will still last all day. Only ran into one problem with Siri. I was trying to get her to send a text message and all she would say was "Something went wrong. Please try again later." I restarted the phone and everything was back to normal. I would definitely recommend this phone to anyone who wants to finally get an iPhone.
This is an excellent phone. I am glad I chose this to use for my business.
As a first time apple buyer I appreciate the security and consistancy the iphone promotes. Call quailty isn't as good as my blackberry was, but otherwise amazed with the functionality and seemlessness.
A clear improvement over the iphone 4 the 4s is everything I wanted a phone to be and don't forsee upgrading to anything anytime soon
Great item and great employees will come back when it's time for upgrade
Phone does not work in several locations around our home and Call quality not great. My daughter is in college and cannot get reception there with AT&T, so not happy with AT&T!!!!!! Overall like phone...service not so much!!!
The best part is being able to write text messages by talking to the phone. It is very accurate. It is easy to get to mail, Facebook, etc. If you own an iPad, you have almost nothing to learn.
The phone works, the camera works, the email works! It works
Have had the phone since Christmas and enjoy it for all the options that are on the phone!!!
I've had all the iphomes and this product just keeps getting better and better!
had the 3 and loved it so much then got the 4 did not like it at all traded for the 3gs and it was ok and now i have the 4s and I love it. This phne is so wonderful it does everything
This is a great phone; the only problem I am having is trying to text fast. It seems like all the other keys are pressed instead of the one I want. Also, I've had some issues with Siri saying foul language. However, it's not happening too often. All in all, it is very convenient to use and the pros over-power the cons.
I had a 3G Iphone prior to purchasing the new 4S, the updated features are so much better and it's much much quicker then the 3G. I'm on this thing 24/7!
would recommend to all my freind's and family and co-workers.
I never write reviews but felt like I should for this. I absolutely love this phone and it does everything. I mean everything. If you need a phone number for a pizza place for example, you dont have to search for the number because pick up your phone and ask it to and it will!! That is just the tip of the iceberg. I am a busy working mother of two and a college student again and with my busy schedule I don't know how I lived without this phone. I pay my bills, all my scheduling, play my games, and even get recipes for dinner right off my phone. I am not sure if I even use the phone/communication part of the phone more than the features it has. The camera on it is awesome and you can even switch the views.The battery is amazing and I never have to charge it like I did with every other phone. The phone is also super fast. I reccommend this phone to anyone and everyone! You won't be sorry.
I finally upgraded from my iPhone 3G-s, and man I am glad I did! The iPhone 4s feel so much more substantial and rugged in your hand, and everything about it is a total upgrade! The screen is remarkable, it is fast both on Wifi and cell data, Siri is helpful beyond compare, and who can beat the number and variety of apps available from the iTunes App Store?! Without a doubt, this is the phone to choose when upgrading or buying new! And I have had NO problems with my battery life! Just make sure you have iOS 5.0.1 or later!
so far,so good! nothing else to compare.friendly user and easy to handle!
I am not a power user but this phone runs flawlessly, interface is great, applications are awsome.
I can not even find anything bad with this phone. The camera is superb, SIRI works like a charm, and the phone is very fast. No problems at all. I am sure some have heard the bad press it has been getting about the battery, Never had a problem with the battery.
This is my 3rd iPhone. Wouldn't use any other. I have a lot of confidence in Apple products.
Apple is the best phone manufacturer in the world! This phone is great for pictures, video, calls (better antenna), web browsing, and all apps and utilities are much faster than previous models. I stopped using the map on my iphone 3g and this one is lightning-fast so I can use it again! Siri is an amazing tool that helps you maximize your phone's services. I use it to voice-text in the car. Love this phone and I'm an iphone customer for life!
I upgraded from the IPhone 3G and I love that the graphics are much improved. The picture is very clear and the photos come out much better. I don't like the life of the battery; you have to charge the phone daily if you use the internet or play games. I also don't like that sometimes if you use the flash, the photos comes out a little blurry. To me, Siri is no big deal; I rarely use. Other than that I love my phone but I could have saved $100 and just got the 4 rather than the 4S.
It's a all around good phone for the price video is good picture's are very good user friendly
Awesome phone easy to use. All the app choices are great. It's really fast and no need for a camera because the phone takes awesome pictures.
The Applie iPhone 4S is a good little device, despite what competitors might say. I love the fact that I could keep my old case and that the phone is still made with durable glass on both sides. I haven't noticed the battery issue mentioned by others, but then again I don't do a lot of video streaming and I charge midday every day. The only flaw I see is that Siri will still send an email or text message to someone while the phone is locked....not very good security from that aspect.
This is my 2nd iPhone and I am happy with it. I bought one for my son and husband and they love their's too.
This is an amazing phone released by Apple. I would say I am most pleased with the speed, improved camera and video. It is quite amazing and can directly compete with point and shoot cameras on the market. I dont use Siri that much but she is a great way to avoid texting while driving. Definitely a worthwhile investment.
I love my NEW iPhone. Its Awesome. I really don't see how they could make it any better than this.
I love my new iphone whats would i do without it. Siri is a great feature and i would hope they keep this up and improve it for iphone 5 when it comes out. i Also hope that the battery would last a bit longer wen apps and internet is being used.
Pre-ordered the 4S through Best Buy Mobile. Great service provided by BestBuy Mobile in Lafayette, LA...Thank You! The iPhone 4S is a great smartphone. I highly recommend this product to anyone looking at purchasing a smarphone. Siri brings the product to a whole new level...thanks Apple:).
was time for a upgrade and very pleased.. best buy was very helpful in my purchase .. much better than ATT!
iPhone 4S is the best yet! I had the 3GS and I love this phone! The screen is awesome (of course) and the phone is so easy to use. I don't use Siri much but I have used it to send text messages and to show to friends. If you are looking for a phone that works with apps that actually work, go iPhone...
I loved everything the phone came with. No problem with Siri and my accent. Only small issue is that not all pics I click with out much light turn out good.The flash is too bright or I need to hone my skills ;)
My four year old daughter is always asking if she can talk to my phone, siri is something else. I cant wait until they release the full version, from my understanding siri is still in beta testing. Besides the artificial intelligence the new iphone 4s is the most fun i have ever had with a phone. I went from an android samsung galaxy vibrant to iphone and am thrilled with the new found apple experience. (Although i am a lot slower at typing now as i did grow very accustmed to the swpe cabality of android.) It even convinced me to get an ipad for christmas. As far as the icloud stuff i misplaced my phone on laundry day and was able to locate it with my brothers iphone. What a wonderful feature and great piece of mind. I love the clarity and amazing screen we love watching youtube and hulu in the car! As far as the problems people have had with battery life and dropped calls from the previous model i have not experienced any of those, i do however always update it so i have heard that will help those who have had problems. The best feature is the mobile hotspot capability, with at&t my phone turns into a wifi device that my laptop can connect to, although the integration for the ipad makes the perfect combination of 2 devices working great together. With the hotspot on your phone it makes any wifi ipad like a 3g one without the extra cost or need of an extra data plan! All in all a great phone that also has lots of learning aps and capabilities for my daughter. I would highly recommend the new iphone 4s!
i love the phone and its easy to use just like any thing that apple makes.
It's a great smartphone. Much faster and the camera is great with 8mb. Siri is also great but kind a having a hard time understanding what I'm saying needs to more clearer but it works great specially when I'm driving.
I was so excited to get this new phone. I preordered and got it the first day it came out. I love all Apple products. I never even considered the possibility this phone wouldn't be amazing. The first day I got it I spent hours playing with Siri. Siri is fun and helpful yet far from perfect. Still, it is impressive. I was hopeful there would be bigger changes, but really Siri is the only impressive thing about this phone. Thats the sole reason i gave this two stars instead of one. But even Siri isn't enough to make me recommend the new 4S. I lose no joke 1% of battery life each minute I use the phone. And yes, I've updated to the new iOS 5.0.1 that's supposed to correct this problem, but it's actually made it worse. If I make the mistake of charging the phone and unplugging it before I go to bed I find it loses 20% in 7 hours of doing nothing! I had to buy a car charger because I can't even get through an entire morning without needing a charge. I cannot recommend this phone at this time. I would wait a few months and see if Apple will fix this problem since the new update did not.
Amazing as all the other iPhones so far and the fact that they have Siri, just makes this that much more exciting to own.
My first Apple purchase, why did I wait so long? Great product for my first smart phone. Very intuitive and well made. I may not have to upgrade to the iPhone5.
This phone does everything it claims. Much faster than my 3GS and Siri is amazing.
Siri is great fun. I bought this just for the new features but the main highlight is iOS5 which you can get with an iphone 4 as well.
Well, this review is for the people that have never owned one and were considering it. I have had a new Andriod based phone since they came out. I loved the OS and I liked the set-up. However, it really just can't compare to the Apple experience. I had my ipod... bought a Macbook... then it all came together with the iphone. Yes, I 100% agree that the specs don't match up with the best of the Android phones. However, what sold me was that they don't change like the Andriod phones do. That was a huge selling point. If you buy an iphone - you are able to do all of the things every other iphone user can do. With Andriod phones, mine was the best of the best... for about a month. My wife's phone was 1 year old and could not even get the upgrade to the OS to get any new apps. She essentially had a dead phone after a year. From there is was easy. I was able to just set it up through my Apple account and it all flowed together. With the cloud feature, app store and all of the things Apple seems to do right - I just cannot see myself switching back to any other type of phone.
They keep coming out with the best products on the market. A huge step from the Iphone 4.
IPHONE IS JUST KILLING THE COMPETION ITS CALLED ANDROID KILLER IPHONES 4S HANDS DOWN BEATS ANY PHONE AND ATT ROCKS THATS ALL I HAVE TO SAY
I've had the 3G, the 3GS and now the 4S. The 4S is clearly faster, the camera is better than my stand alone camera, and Siri is addictive. If you are up for an upgrade get the 4S for sure you won't regret it.
the iphone 4s in at&t 16 is awsome the best one ever. my only concern is that i have the 3g and my wifi on but it keeps saying that it can not connect to the internet, hopfully it will work later on.
Absolutely love my Iphone over my previous phone (Samsung Galaxy 1)
I waited a long time for an iPhone, and I love it.
I use my iphone as my computer. It is the best phone i ever had. I love that I can see it out side. I will not upgrade unless there is a feature on the new one that i really want. I love how i can use my gift cards from my ipod on my iphone and all the apps and music i have already. I love how can use use them. Before I got my iphone i was going to get an android phone but I said then I can't use my gift cards ,apps and music that i have. Best phone ever!!!!!
Bought this phone for my wife, The Iphone the super smart phone nuff said
This phone is easy and fun to operate no matter what age you are. There is so much you can do with the iphone and the apps are endless.
I really love this phone. I have had no problems with it at all except for that when Im writing a text message you can touch a letter a million times and it wont type it. Its like it locks up on that one letter for a minute. Other than that, I have had no problems. I have amazing service with it now than I did with my other phone. I have 4G everywhere!
Great phone with iCloud. The battery does not last long at all.
I've waited a long time to get an iPhone, even though we have used Mac computers for several years. Well worth waiting for. Love it!!
Like the phone, am having trouble since I did the IOS 6 update - seem to drop more calls.
Switched from a 3gs to a 4S. I got my 3 gs in Jan 2010, and never had the need to change it. It eventually wore out (battery), and I had no need to get a different type of phone, since the Iphone has everything I need in a phone.
Excellent phone overall. Very easy and intuitive to use.
Would recommend this phone to anyone that uses their phone for everything because this has it all.
I love Apple products. It's the easiest phone to use and connects all my other Apple products together. I just love it!!
I personally love my iPhone 4s. I like all the features and the fact that it is easy to use. It's not too big nor too small.
My son kept telling me to get an IPHONE and i kept putting it off....oh i wish i hadn't. I am loving this phone. Still figuring out ways to make my life easier with it!
Very nice phone with Siri to use as your personal assistant. IOS 6 is available for it now which makes it run as good as the new 5. I bought this instead of the 5 because I'd rather let Apple clear all the bugs out of the 5 before I get it.
Good phone, cost is a little high and if you don't have a service plan you are screwed
I've always liked OtterBox commuter cases for how small and compact they are while still staying with the OtterBox commitment to rugged protection so when upgrading my phone to a new Apple Iphone a commuter case was my first choice but I was very sad when I received my case in the mail. On the website the Teal case was a really cool greenish-blue, borderline forest green color but in real life when I opened my package I almost thought I had received the wrong case. It is a very light sky blue color not the darker green I thought I was receiving.
Thankfully I haven't had to test how well it holds up when the phone has a hard drop as of yet. I liked the fact it had two layers of protection however I wish it covered the front of the phone like the defender series but without the bulk. One thing I noticed the hard plastic outside cover is a bit distorted, there's a gap between the hard plastic and the rubber coverings. I bought the pink and white case first and kept the least distorted one of the two. After a while the gap between the hard plastic and soft rubber has lessened. Also the rubber has a tendacy to transfer the dye of your jeans or the inside of your purse. You have to press the power button firmly to turn it off, which isn't a problem for me but could be for others. The earbud and the usb ports are protected well.
I love this case! It looks amazing on my white iPhone. The only downside is the screen protector that it comes with is garbage... buy a Zagg shield instead.
I purchased this to hear radio broadcasts and not bother anyone else.
I just picked up this case last night. Very different than your usual case in that it is textured. I do like the color, but it is not as pictured online. Online it says it is blue/purple, definitely not though.
I don't remember how long I have had this case on my iPhone 4S, but I can't complain. I have dropped this poor phone more then I think I have dropped all other cell phones I have owned in my life combined. This includes numerous drops down the steps, meaning top step all the way to the floor below (never happened until all the carpet in the house had been replaced with hard wood floors). The case has held up perfectly, and more importantly, has kept my phone in one piece without a single scratch to show. The description here says purple/blue (which doesn't match the picture even), the case is a dark teal. The case is hard, and has a somewhat interesting texture on the back, but while being interesting I can't say it ever bothered me. I have most definitely put this case through its paces, it may be a little dirty, but it has done EXACTLY what I bought it for...protect my iPhone :)
This case protects the very expensive iPhone and works great!
I had the previous Defender case with the iPhone 4. I now have this one, for the 4S and both are great cases. Yes they are a bit pricey but way better than paying to get you iPhone fixed or for a brand new one. I work in a warehouse and my phone sees a ton of harm but this seriously saves it every time. I have dropped it, thrown it at walls, and even kicked it. My co-workers see how indestructible it is and will now just smack it out of my hands because they know nothing will happen. It also has a built in screen protector. I have had no issues with this case at all. Don't even hesitate buying, just save your iPhone and get one of these.
iPhone is great but using it with virgin mobile service really brings the phone down. Can't download any apps using 3G must be to slow . Ive talk to tech support they have no clue why i cant download apps usinjg 3g I have to use wifi to download apps . virgin mobile they blame apple store . Yeah right, I tried to post on theire site they reject my review since I was bad mouthing theire service. Still I can stream music fine and use gps service fine . Lucky all the places I hang out the service works except cape may nj certain spots touchy .
As per ALL Apple products the battery life is terrible, but that was to be expected because, after all, it is an Apple. I came from Blackberry, a die hard fan, and (per Apple tradition) there are very few settings you can customize to your liking with the iPhone. I also can't find if it is possible to add a custom dictionary like you can with BB. For instance, with BB you can set it to change "u" to "you" automatically in a text. I can't find that I can do that with iPhone. It is also VERY fragile, which is obvious but still a concern. The battery also heats up, very quickly, when in use but it also cools very quickly when it is back at rest. However, I have really enjoyed this phone and will probably hold onto it for for a while, as an investment phone. The picture quality/screen are AMAZING! The graphics are so crisp!! It is also a very fast phone and I've had no problems with it. I'm falling in love...slowly but surely.
You have to pay a lot of money up front for the phone but in the long run it is cheaper. It will pay for itself in the long run. In about a year. Compared to other cell phone services it is cheap. The phone works great, Good sound and reception. Battery lasts for awhile. Can only get 3G Internet but it does the job.
Finally, a no contract iPhone! I've used other no contract smart phones, and they just cannot compare to the quality of the iPhone.
Love the iPhone, but haven't been able to take advantage of it due to Virgin Mobile's HORRIBLE service. Even though they act so nice, after a month of escalations and no solution, I am still not able to: 1- text 2- use iMessage 3- use FaceTime 4- show how many voice messages I have Buy this phone, but AVOID Virgin Mobile as your provider. The guy in charge of Virgin needs to focus more on his phone company than his spaceship!
The phone was fine but not worth the high cost. I wasn't able to setup SMS paging and called Apple to complain. Apparently that is not a supported capability and I need it for work so .... back went the phone.
The price of the phone is more than offset in the savings on the plan. $35/month can't be touched. Was paying $85+ on Verizon. I get good coverage at home and at work so no complaints there.
This brand has fancy look and false advertising, the packing bluffing how good it's and bla bla bla, but it is nothing could be further than the truth! The design is very stupid: it require you to get your hands wet while applying the sheet on your iPhone - literally. I believe this is the first time in human history that an instruction manual tells you to wet your hand before you touch your electronic product. According to the manual, you will need to spray the liquid (they are just simply water) on your hand and the sheet, and then apply the sheet on your iPhone screen, and eventually get your iPhone wet. I can tell the water went into the space around my home key, and spaces around my screen. Even worse, the sheet is difficult to move and adjust position when attached to the screen, there will be bubbles too. Avoid this product.
The only issue I have with this product is that it is dang near impossible to get all the corners to stick correctly. I have had mine for several months and the back right corner will not stay down.
Sure, this thing was a lot of money to buy. It costs $30 for the front and back skins and then $8 for Best Buy to put it on. But these come with a lifetime warranty, and if the thing ever comes off, you can take it to Best Buy and have someone there install a new one for free (since the $8 is a one time deal), and it's probably being done by someone who has installed hundreds of these things before so you can be sure they know what they are doing. So not only is the reinstallment of the skins on the phone free for as many times as you take it in, but the skins themselves are free after you have bought them once. Well worth the investment
The Invisible Shield by Zagg is the best screen protector I have ever bought to date. The protector gives the screen a gel-like texture that helps with grip and protects from scratching. As with all screen protectors, they can be a bit of a pain to install perfectly but that shouldn't deter you from buying one. Don't think twice of buying one because of all the poor reviews from people whom I assume were too quick to install and therefore too quick to judge. Just take your time and READ THE INSTRUCTIONS! You won't be disappointed!
The screen protectors are great. I have the otter box commuter case and the front and back invisishield on my new iPhone 4s that I'm using to write this review. I never used screen protectors before but I figured since I'm upgrading to the 4s I better go ahead and protect it. They were very easy to put on and I actually liked using the solution it came with. It seemed to do a little better job at gettin the bubbles out of the screen. All in all I would give this a 5 star rating easily. If your considering getting a screen protector, follow the instructions and you will be fine. I bet 50 percent of the bad reviews on protectors are from ppl who don't follow directions.
I was hesitant to spend this much on just a screen protector and even more so to pay to have them install it. But after having the fear of god placed in my head from the sales guys that I would mess it up I bit the bullet and had them install it. About a week into having the screen protector the corners of the screen protector started picking up a gross, dirt looking color, yellowish brown. I shower every day, wash my hand multiple times a day and so to have this discolor so soon made me crazy. I have the white iPhone, so if you have the black one, you would probably not ever notice this. Read on zagg to use their install solution to clean the protector, I did, nothing happened. The screen protector is permanently stained... I figured since I had such a bad experience I could return it to best buy here, BUT they informed me that I couldn't and the only way I could get a refund is to send it back to zagg, pay the shipping, wait for the new one to come and return it. O' and that rip to install it, yeah, non-refundable. Go with your gut, this is too expensive and too good to be true and if they make it so hard to install that you have to pay someone to do it for you, it really isn't worth it. Here is your answer, NO! Please don't make the same mistake I did. Go with Otterbox, you just snap it in it's case, screen protector built in. I can't believe I got sucked in...but with not a lot of other options I felt this HAD to be the best right since it took up more than half of the wall space on in the store. O' how wrong I was. The picture below is after I just cleaned it. O' and that same nice customer service I got while paying them to install it was quickly taken away when I was told to pay zagg more money to have best buy return it. Ugh!!!
After putting the Invisible Shield over my new IPhone, the screen is not very responsive and more over when u put it in pocket the shield tends to come out.
Can't wait until I return it! Tried it several times - didn't stick, it scratched, bubbled, etc. Even after waiting 24 hours. I have a HTC Incredible 2. BTW. I'm an engineer with a Masrer's Degree.
Considering this is a "military grade" film, I have lost faith in the military due to the poor quality of this. Not scratch proof by any means and definitely a smudge magnet. Additionally, the instructions provided are horrible and don't even suggest cleaning the device before you apply this "military grade" film.
I choked down the 30.00 purchase price due to the lifetime warranty. After the protective cover started coming up at the edges after about 9 months it looked as if the warranty was in affect. The catch is that they still charge $4.00 to $51.00 for shipping and handling depending on which option you chose. There is NO option to avoid these charges by going to best buy to get a replacement. So even for the replacement these guys are making more money beyond the huge profit from the original purchase. USPS shipping for this small item would be less than 2.00 at worst. I have gone back to the 5 covers for $4.00 that I can replace every 6 months and still come out way ahead in the long run. Best Buy... Pay attention and offer other alternatives. Thank you
You would think there would be something special considering these are $30, but you'd be wrong. First of all, the magic spray bottle, or whatever it is, came empty. It was nearly impossible to get the protector off the backing..I had to slide a knife between it and the backing. Even barely touching the very corners left fingerprints, and all I can say is bubbles galore. If you want a better front and back protector, look at Power Support USA's Crystal or Antiglare films. Their crystal film is almost unnoticeable on the retina display. They are around $15 and you get TWO back protectors and a screen protector.
I purchased the full body protector for my I phone had Best Buy install it for me.They did a great job on it. If it is installed correctly it is a very nice piece no complaints,
The water base solution that was provided in a mini bottle was dried out. After attempting to apply the face sheild, I had many problems with the alignment. I used the rubber squeegee to force out any bubbles, and caused me to stretch the sheild. Which of course made it to long for the phone and the alignment didn't match. That was a faliure, but I attempted putting on the back sheild with alittle more success. Unfortunately, after placing the phone in my pocket multiple times the edges started to come up and attrack the lent in my pocket. For paying $30.00, I am very upset.
I just bought it today after reading a bunch of reviews about how hard it was to install it. That's not true....its simple to install and once it fully dries, it looks really nice and actually makes the screen a lil clearer. Best Buy offers to install it for $8 but hey, if I can put it on, ANYBODY can! Definitely worth the money. Also, if u put it on urself and it doesn't turn out right, Best Buy will let u exchange it and then u can just give them the $8 to do it or, just get ur money back
This is my 4th Invisishield, and I am a fan! I put one on my wife's Droid, I had one on my Droid, I have one on my iPad, and I recently added this product to my iPhone. I think the people who are rating it so low are having a hard time installing it. I admittedly had a hard time with my first one, but I learned a trick: First thing to do is throw away that spray bottle. Get a bowl of water, and put a drop or two of liquid dish soap in it. You can apply the mixture with your finger, or dip the whole protector into it before beginning. It will work wonders. I NEVER have air bubbles, and you can actually lay the screen protector flat and manipulate it until you get it just right. The only reason I gave 4 instead of 5 stars is because it was $30, and at $30, they should not forget the microfiber cloth.
Very easy to install and stays on. Have had great service out of it.
Film makes high retina display on iphone look terrible. Way overpriced...wouldnt mind paying if it actually worked...didnt have any troubles with same product on my Droid but its definitely not good on iphone.
Let me start by saying this is my second Zagg install. My first was with the iPod Touch 4th generation. I bought the full body and while, like all Zagg products, it was difficult to get on, I did manage to do it perfectly. This today...oh boy. First of all it didn't come with the microfiber cloth. Not sure why, but luckily I had one on hand that I used for the iPod Touch. You'd think for over $30 with tax though, this thing would have all the necessities. I am writing to the company about it. Secondly, I don't know if they have changed it or what but the picture shows indvidual cut out holes for things like the camera and speaker, and the camera and flash. Mine was not like that. Mine had a giant hole for each. While I tried hard to line it up and get it perfect, part of the skin is overlapping on the silver ring around the back camera. I also noticed the Zagg skin that is supposedly "precition cut" for each individual device doesn't seem to be so. I have quite a gap all the way around the phone. Most noticeably arond the home button. It does have a small hole cut out, then a small ring cut out, so I'm not sure what that's about, if you're supposed to use the ring as well or what? Why not just have the hole the size of the actual home button. Also with this one, I have a significant amount of bubbling around the whole phone. When I did the iPod Touch it was perfect, this thing looks really bad right now but they say it will work itself out in a few days so I'm hoping that is so. Worst part about this, and it's not just this particular one, but all Zagg skins from what I hear and read is they don't go to the exact edge of the phone screens so any rubbery case you put on it pushes on the eges and lifts it up letting in dust and leading to it no longer sticking, looks like junk and doesn't protect your phone. Luckly Zagg has a lifetime replacement policy, but you still have to pay shipping, as well as mail the current "damaged" one you have on your phone back. I also saw that they have a claim where you can get a new one if they remove the skin to repair your phone, so that is really considerate of them. The cases could also be to blame, but for the price of this and the fact that they claim to be precision cut is what angers me. Also I have scratched them with just my fingernail, so when they say they don't really scratch, they definitely do, BUT it protects your phone and they replace it if scratched so it's kind of hard to complain about that.
The only thing I don't like is the fact that my case doesn't go on easy with the extra layer of film on it. The lady didn't tell me that I probably didn't need it since I bought a really durable case.
I got my iPhone 4 on the second launch day and have been highly obsessed ever since. When I purchased my first Zagg protectors, I had them on for about 3 months, until I accidentally sprayed cologne towards the iPhone and it covered the front protector in sparkling looking dots. But before that had happened, I must say, they are fantastic protectors. Not a scratch on the back or front (no case on the back, just the bumper). I purchased about 5 other Zagg protection orders for several different reasons, one being that I could never get it on without dust/lint under the protector...I love my iPhone and want these protectors on perfectly (and I do feel the need for the protectors on the iPhone; it's not immune to scratches, but does hold up well) but could never get it on flawlessly. So a friend told me that Best Buy would install them for a small extra charge, so I went there. Well, hoping it would turn out perfect, it didn't... I have small specs of dust everywhere, little lines running up and down the protector, and what I think is the installers finger print smudge on it since he didn't use the application spray on his hands. After 2 days of usage, my white iPhone 4 Bumper is starting to push up the edges but after reading these reviews now knowing I should wait a day or so to let the protectors settle, I'll wait a day or so until I use the new ones heavily or put a case/bumper on it (I didn't experience this with my other Zagg protectors and bumper...). So hopefully I'll be going up to Best Buy in the next day or so so they can replace and re-install it for free. I just can't win with these things, so I pray for a break!!! I'll write a new review after I get the new ones on! Wish me luck for perfect protectors!!!
I've been using the same ZAGG screen protector for my Iphone for close to 3 1/2 months now and I must say that it's definitely the best screen protector out there. Not only is it a perfect fit but when installed properly it does not come off easy. My screen gets dirty from time to time but there's never a permanent stain that does not wipe off easily. As long as you follow the instructions and make sure your fingers are clean and the surface of the phone is free of dust you should have no problems installing it. Make sure you spray your fingers, the phone, and the invisishield thoroughly so you can position it perfect on your phone before using the squeegy to clean out the bubbles. The remaining small bubbles will disappear once the phone is completely dry!
I purchased this product and found it extremely difficult to install correctly. It comes with some liquid and a black cardboard sqeege which is supposed to remove the bubbles that, guaranteed, will form on installing. The product is so thin and sticky that it is next to impossible to slide it (as the instructions say) after applying it to the glass, in spite of the liquid application. I also found the supplied cardboard "squeege" useless in removing the bubbles. The product is also quite expensive. When I attempted to get a warranty replacement to make another attempt to install, Zagg wanted my credit card so they could charge me, for what they deem as return "shipping and handling". I do not recommend this product.
Great product. I love it until I found out that I got charges $5 more than if I got it direct. Tomorrow I am going to give them a piece of my mind :D
I bought this thinking it was going to be great. They boasted the military grade plastic. Well it was a pain to put on. The spray they give you sometimes gets into your earpiece hole and I don't think moisture should get in there but it's the only way to apply it. Then if your phone gets warm the screen protector slides around because it uses a light adhesive instead of static like every other iphone protector. I was so disappointed. To top it off once it comes off on the edges after it gets warm, which it will, then the lint in your pocket sticks to it and it will never come off. Because of the adhesive you cant wipe it off like other screen protectors so you just have to throw it away. Complete waste of money
I have read multiple reviews, both good and bad. It was not to hard to install, just follow directions. Once it was on it is great. It does show finger prints easily, just wipe it off. I can see that "orange peel" look, only when I really look for it, and at angles that I would even use the phone for. Light has to shine on it and viewed almost horizontally. I did have micro bubble that I could not get out. It did go away in a day, now it's perfect. I originally had vertical lines in my screen. I took it off and realized it was the protector. I scratched the case when installing. It was a pain to take off, but all I had to do was take my finger and peel a corner. Once I did that, it came off very easy, and left no residue on the screen. I ordered a replacement for $3.99 and it arrived at few days later. I put a new one on, now it's flawless. The lifetime warranty is great, and cheap..
The Zagg screen protector began peeling at the edges within a week. Once the iphone cover was added to eliminate phone reception issues, the screen peels and bubbles constantly. For the amount of money spent on this, I'd expect it to be compatible with all phone covers. Save your money and buy a cheap, non-shrinking screen cover. That way, when they have to be replaced often, you're not out so much money.
Is a good shield for Iphone 4, i would like tohave more liquid to put to the shield but its Ok.
Zagg makes a great product, but it is pricey. I have installed these on my iPhone 3GS, iPad and most recently on iPhone 4. Make sure your hands are squeaky clean, and spray you fingers, the device and both sides of the protector with the supplied spray. I had issues with the corners peeling on the iPhone 4. The issue was with a film on the glass, not with the screen protector. Swab off the glass with alcohol (lightly), and let it evaporate prior to installing the shield... problem solved. This is quite easy to apply after you have done it a couple of times, but you can screw it up quite easily. If unsure, pay the $10 bucks to have it done. Once applied, don't mess with it... leave it overnight and you're golden.
This is an invaluable product to have on your phone which is basically a $200/$300 piece of glass. And for those who are worried about having a hard time for the installation, there's a lot of videos on YouTube demonstrating how to do it properly. I bought a full body version for the iPad and a front-only for the iPhone. As long as you follow instructions and leave your device alone for 12 hours after installing, you should be ok. Aside from protecting the surfaces, it also adds a more tactile feel to it and makes it not as slippery when you're holding it in your hand without any sort of case.
Although this shield is thicker than others, you pay for it with less screen clarity and noticeably less screen sensitivity. I've also experienced the edges peeling off like others have noted. I've installed several of these types of shields, and followed the instructions (as well as hints from others online) and it still peels. As soon as I get my free bumper from Apple, I'll be buying a screen protector from another company.
A friend of mine had this on his 3G and it looked great after a year. At one point it fell out of his pocket going 75 mph on his bike and protected the screen, not a scratch. He told me the only negative was that its hard to install and it looks very bubbly right after you install but give it a day or two and the micro bubbles will settle out and it looks awesome. I have now installed 2 of these protectors on iPhone 4's both front and back and can say that you need to read the directions wash your hands well and keep your hands and the protector very wet, make sure you use enough of the solution. Use the squeegee and get all the big bubbles out, there will be micro bubbles, they will settle out, once its had time to settle it looks great. I have used 5 different screen protectors between 3 different iPhones and i can say i wish i had bought this in the first place for each one, i was intimidated by the installation, but in the end did a great job once i tried it out. The only negative is that it feels pretty rubbery, which takes some getting used to. But of all the protectors once i got it on it looked the best. Oh and be careful not to get finger prints on the application side. Overall i would say that those complaining about it simply didn't read the directions or never gave it time to properly seat, the directions say minimum 24 hours of not using your phone and up to 3 days for all micro bubbles to settle out.
Many days left alone for drying. Even purchased twice for a second chance. However fine and lasted two years on my old iPhone 3G.
I bought this screen protector a couple of days ago for my new iPhone and so far so good. The only problem I had was installing it. It took me several times to finlly get it one right. Plus you need to make sure that no dust particles get onto the screen because it will show and will annoy most people. I recommend if you don't have the patience to get it installed by a rep. I recommend getting this even if you plan or already have a case for your phone. Once it's installed properly, you can't even tell it's on your phone and it doesn't weaken the retina display. The only thing I didn't like was the price because you know it probably cost less than 2 dollars to make this screen protector. But if you care for your new iPhone and want to keep it looking new for as long as you have it, this is the best protector on the market.
Love it! I use my iPhone for everything, even taking before and after pics while I am working on my classic car. The cover protects my car from the grease, grime and keeps it scratch free.
I never write reviews but just wasted a ton of time on this and don't want anyone else to do the same. I thought I was smart getting the most expensive protector for my new iPhone but obviously I should have gotten the standard 3-pack type with the easy appliacation. I agree wholeheartedly with all the 1 star reviews and most of the 5 star reviews of this product are written in a language that sound suspiciously like they could have been written by the Invisble Shield marketing people. I have installed many screen protectors with no issues, I'm not new to this. The application is impossible and when you're done you have a ton of little bubbles, the feel is very tacky/sticky , the texture is like an orange peel and it peels off very easily. The feel of the product overall is like one of those cheap plastic decals that stick to windows that you can easily peel right off. Going to get my $30 back tomorrow.
I have owned all versions of the IPhone and struggled with the cheaper film screens. When I purchased my Bumper for my Iphone 4 the tech at the Apple store said I won't need a film screen for the phone. Rather than risking finger prints and dropping the phone and scratching up the glass I decided to check out the full body shield. I had Best buy installed it for me, the tech was great. She did in no time flat with no bubbles. The key is to leave the phone off for about 45 minutes after installation and leave the case or bumper off for 24 hours to let everything set. I purchased this in July as soon as I got my phone and I wipe the fingerprints off every now and then with a cloth that you use for eyeglasses. No peels, no cracks and no rollups. It does not take away from the resolution of the Iphone 4. It's by far the best screen out there. The best part is the lifetime warranty so you can always get replacements.
!!! Extremely easy to apply !!! I've bought a screen protector for every iPhone I've bought! (3 so far) I (like everyone else in the cell phone era) use my cell phone a lot! So, having oily finger prints, dust & dirt on my iPhone just won't do! The military grade scratch resistance, for this highly used iPhone is a must! Great product does everything it says it does at a price cheaper than ones I've bought before! You need to be like 'Nike' on this one... (Just Do It)
PROS: nicely packaged, looks great on phone, very strong material CONS: even though the cover is pre-cut you still have to remove pieces of plastic for the buttons which can be tedious. I installed mine and it looked great, none of the edges frailed up. 3 days later, the edges peeled up. If you put the phone in your pocket, lint WILL work its way between the glass and Zagg cover I would not recommend this product. The same thing happened to my friend that bought one.
THIS SCREEN PROTECTOR IS THE BEST IT LOOKS GREAT ON THE PHONE AND THE PROTECTION IS UNBEATABLE. NOW YOU MUST REALIZE IT TAKES A STEADY HAND TO INSTALL THIS AND YOU REALLY HAVE TO WET YOUR HANDS WITH THE SOLUTION OR YOU WILL GET FINGER PRINTS ON THE SCREEN PROTECTOR OTHER THAN THAT VERY EASY TO INSTALL. PLUS IT HAS A LIFE TIME WARRANTY I GOT MY IPHONE 4 AND PUT IT ON AND THAN NOTICES THERE WAS SOME YELLOW STAIN ON THE IPHONE I TOOK IT IN TO THE APPLE STORE AND THEY GAVE ME A NEW PHONE I THAN CALLED ZAGG AND THEY SENT ME A REPLACEMENT SCREEN PROTECTOR FREE OF CHARGE BECAUSE OF THE LIFETIME WARRANTY UNLIKE THE OTHER PROTECTORS THAT YOU WOULD HAVE TO PAY FOR AGAIN
I purchased this iPhone4 screen protector at Best Buy because the brand I had on my 3GS wasn't available at the time. I really regret it. It was very difficult to install. This is my 4th iPhone and I have had screen protectors on all of them and his was by far the hardest to install. After the install it looked horrible, after a few days it was better, but still diminished the fabulous screen on the iPhone4. Now that Power Support released their Crystal Film for the iPhone4 I removed this and installed that. Much better product, almost invisible unlike this "invisible shield" which looks awful! Don't waste your money! I wish I had waited for the Power Support Crystal Film Set to come out so I didn't waste my $32.74!!!
This is a MUST to have on anything you can stick on.
Judging from the videos on their website and the thickness of the material, it'd be a great product. That is if you could actually get it on the first time correctly. Drop it, get dust on it, one fingerprint, etc and you're hosed. I took all the proper precautions but still wouldn't stick to the edges. Every case I tried peeled up the edges. Has a very "sticky" feeling to the face as well so dust/papers/even bugs get stuck to the screen. Finally returned it and got the $15 3pack and haven't looked back.
It had that orange peel look, but that was not the issue. I had it in my pocket one day with a reciept. The reciept somehow stuck to the adhesive side of the shield and lifted it up then stuck to the paper! Its hard to get a right fit because of that tiny ridge that the iPhone 4 has on the border. If you have any piece of the shield on that border, you're hosed. I wasted $40 (including install) and cant get my money back. Buyer beware!
I had BestBuy install the screen protector on my iPhone 4 for $12 (front and back) because I'd seen co-workers struggle for weeks trying to get bubbles out. The end result is that it was perfectly installed and works beautifully. It hasn't scratched yet.
Purchased this to protect the front and back of my iphone 4. I was able to get it installed correctly and was able to get all of the bubbles out. However, I carry my phone in my pocket and after just a week, the back cover started to peel off. Tried reapplying the solution provided but that didn't help. $30 wasted. I have had iphones for years and have never had a problem with other screen protectors. They will usually last me 6 months or more before they need to be replaced. At $10 - $15 for pack of 3, that's not bad. But this one at $30 for 1 and only lasts a week... never again.
Do not provide protection to your phone just to the screen! And is too expensive!
I got Best Buy to install this product for me, so there were no bubbles in the film. It also was virtually transparent when using the device. As some have mentioned, it is a bit tacky (sticky) after the initial application, but this has aided in making the device easier to hold; it also wears off slightly over time. I really like the fact that this product is covered by a lifetime guarantee. I had to get a replacement phone, and the company shipped out a replacement within two days of requesting a replacement. This case is perfect for anyone who doesn't want to lose the aesthetics of the device and still have good protection.
I bought the iFrogz and the Invisible Shield full body screen protector for my iPhone 4. This combination works well. Installation of the Invisible Shield is fairly easy. I highly recommend watching the installation videos on Zagg's website. When I purchased my Invisible Shield for the iPad, it took me a while to install. I then watched the videos and realized that I didn't spray enough water onto the adhesive side. Also, don't try to squeegee out all of the bubbles. The small bubbles will work themselves out over a few days. Another note: what's not clear in the description is that this is the front and back screen protectors only. Zagg has another full-body kit that also covers the side.
This shield is amazing with how well it protects. I don't even hesitate putting my phone in my pocket with change and keys in there, or laying it on hard, rough surfaces. I have a home-made stylus for it tipped with aluminum foil and use it without fear. Afterall, if it does scratch the protector I get it replaced for free. If you want the best protection possible without a bulky case - this is the way to go. I've used this product on my last 2 iphones and also my ipad. When installing it, read the instructions! All of the poor reviews here seem like they missed a point in the instructions. *Wet both sides of the film thoroughly = easy to align *WET YOUR HANDS = no fingerprints *The materail stretches and compresses, keep the edge of the film a couple mm from the edge of the screen = no peeling (even the corners) *wet the squeegee = no marks on the film *dont worry about bubbles, the material breaths so bubbles and haziness (adhesive) work themselves out over a couple days and the film becomes crystal clear. *if you do mess it up, it isn't a loss - let it dry then reapply. If all else fails take it to a zagg store (in malls all over) and they'll fix/replace it for free.
I went out on a limb and bought two of ZAGG's products. The iPhone 4 front/back cover and their iPad screen protector. Both products I would review the same...poor. I've used several brands of screen covers on my old iPhone 3G and comparatively speaking, the ZAGG product is lacking in several areas. First of all, the cover looks "grainy" (almost like leather) and takes away from the nice, smooth look of your iPhone. You can see the grains as you look at your screen straight on which is unfortunate. Secondly, the cover is thick and soft compared to other brands, and is nearly impossible to put on without tiny bubbles (and I mean tiny) underneath certain parts of it. I would describe it as "fizz" from a soda can. You can lift and reapply it and, occasionally, it goes away, but if you look closely, they are everywhere. It makes no difference how much you squeegee them, either. Lastly, as I mentioned earlier, the ZAGG protection covers just look terrible on the phone. They really do. I buy Apple products because of their asthetics and clean look. Unfortunately, after putting the ZAGG protectors on my phone, it now looks like I glued two pieces of clear leather on each side of it. My iPad looks even worse with the larger screen.
I have been reading stories and video of how some Best Buy iPhone 4 skins installations have not gone well for some people. I went to the Norwalk, CT location yesterday and was helped by a mobile associate named Imran. (Forgive my spelling) He was firendly and did an outstanding job installing the Zagg Invisible Shield on my iPhone 4. What's good about the company is that Zagg offers a lifetime warranty for the life of the phone. Take your iPhone to Best Buy in Norwalk, CT.
I don't normally write reviews. But as for yesterday I wasted 20+ dollars on buying this Invisible C**p by ZAGG. Three hours of bubbles removing, and ended up throwing it away! ! ! A Total Waste of Money! You might is well take out 20+ dollars and burn it ! The shield material is too soft, and that's why it's collecting tiny pocket of air / bubbles. If you use the squeegee too hard you will end up ripping or cause marks on the plastic shield. Fingerprints collecting too as you are putting this c**p shield on your iPhone. Also this shield material will also collect lint, because it feels kinda sticky. The BEST film I've used for my iPhones so far is Crystal Film by Power Support. I don't know why Mac Store don't carry the Crystal Film by Power Support this time.
Lasted only a day before it started rolling up on itself. Easy to install and worked fine until I slid the Iphone into a leather case. If you slide the phone into anything that is slightly snug at all like a pocket or case the edge on the shield will just roll up on itself and then it is basically trash. Might be worth $2-3 but not $30. Sure it has a guarantee, but don't want another one. Total waste of money.
In my opinion this is one of the better screen protectors on the market. I have bought this product in the past for my 3G. The price is expensive when compared to other screen protectors, but how many of them come with a lifetime guarantee? I've had one for my 3G for 2 years and only needed to replace it once. This was due to me getting the protector dirty after trying to remove the screen protector, but Zagg replaced it free of charge so I considered it a good investment. My 3G still looks brand new even after 2 years of use. Therefore, I see no reason why this product should be any different now that i have upgraded my phone to a iPhone 4. Installation is not easier for beginners. My advice, read the instructions before attempting to install. As a tip - make sure you spray your fingers, the phone screen and the protector, this will make the installation a little easier in order to align the protector correctly. Worst case scenario pay Best Buy to install it for you.
I've installed a variety of these shields on my gadgets over the past few years and I just finished installing the front/back shields on my iPhone 4. Perfect installation and no discoloring. Improper or rushed installation is probably the primary source of dissatisfaction. This is really easy to install if you follow instructions and take it very slowly. The key is wetting your fingers and the front and back of the sheet before you place it on the phone. Once you place it on, you can fine tune the placement by sliding it around. Don't worry about frying your gadget with the solution - just turn it off and remove the excess water as you squeegee. Another helpful hint to try to remove the cut-outs while it's still on the white sheet.
I just traded in my iPhone 3G for the beautiful new iPhone 4. For two years I had the same screen protector (Power Support brand) I bought from Apple on the old iPhone and it protected my screen perfectly at a cost of $14.99 for 3 protectors (I sold the other two with the used iPhone!). So, I figured I was getting something better with the Zagg InvisibleSHIELD due to its price. Installation was not as difficult as some reviewers are stating - mine went on just fine and after a day or two (as stated in the instructions) any tiny bubbles that were trapped under the shield upon installation were gone. It also aligned with the phone perfectly - I think that some people are inadvertently stretching the shield during installation. Here come the negatives: It is true that the surface has an orange-peel texture to it. In addition, the surface is a bit tacky - it has a rubber-like feel that prevents your fingers from gliding nicely over the touch screen. Worst of all - there are very fine, vertical rainbow-like lines that I believe are in the adhesive. These lines cause a very strange distortion when looking at the screen. This distortion is subtle, but believe me (I'm a designer/photographer) they are there and due to the iPhone 4's new very fine pixel structure, this mini-prism-like effect is multiplied - giving the screen a low-res look - totally negating this great new feature of the phone. I am not the only one who noticed this with this product - you can google 'zagg rainbow lines'. The positives: I'm pretty darn sure that thing will protect your screen no matter what you throw at it... but it will detract from your enjoyment of this incredible device.
i got this shield because everyone recommended it. too much packaging for a low quality product. the cuts of the shield are poorly done, it seams like it was cut by hand. then the actual shield, the film, had a horrible orange peel, it made the iphone look horrible and you are not able to enjoy the gorgeous screen. overall pretty bad product, i'm going to best buy to get a refund because $30 can be better spent on an actual case
Pay for the installation (totally worth it!). The negative commenters probably self-installed their Invisible Shield. I tried to help a friend self-install after I raved about how great the product was, and it just didn't turn out well... Bubbles, dust particles, crooked... But, he got a free replacement after 1 month and then paid BB to install. My first Zagg Invisible Shield was my iPhone 3G. It delivered on every promise! It saved my phone from countless scratches, and I swear it even helped to cushion the many times I dropped it. After 13 months the edges of Invisible Shield had started peeling and gathering dust, so I took advantage of the full warranty and had it replaced for free. In a nutshell - HIGHLY Recommended if you're willing to pay for the install. NOT Recommended if you're going to self-install.
I just wrote this great review of this product and how terrible BAD it is, but Best Buy has a timeout so ALL was lost. In my frustration, I'm writing something short and sweet. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. IT IS TERRIBLE. DO NOT SPEND EXTRA MONEY TO HAVE IT PROFESSIONALLY INSTALLED. Instead, buy one of the other screen protectors that has a hard plastic surface. The Zagg Invisible Shield is NOT invisible and has a orange peel like surface texture, and if you put it into your pocket, your keys and whatever else will imprint into the surface for a short time which dramatically detracts from the elegant beauty of the iPhone 4. It also collects lint, dust and other debris which can be VERY difficult to remove, often requiring water. Water is also included for the installation process, but is very dangerous to the phone, and I worry that some people may inadvertantly ruin their phones. The protective skins constantly bubble up and peel, collecting more lint and debris. It's just awful. My overall experience with this product has been terrible, and I'll be returning it in the next day or two whenever I can get over to BB to return it. If I could, I would give this product a 0 out of 5 stars instead of a 1 of 5. In my opinion, it's really THAT BAD! Not in ANY way worth $30 dollars, and no more than $10. Other screen protects are $20 dollars for 3! I could not in any way give this product a positive review in light of my experience without my conscience taking a huge hit. Sorry Zagg, but this product is a dismal failure.
This is the third time I've attempted to use one of these on one of my devices. The other two were dismal failures, with dust, bubbles, peeling corners, etc. THIS time however, after purchasing my new iPhone 4 - I Paid best buy $13 to install it for me - and it works awesome! No bubbles, peels, problems... Just does what it's supposed to do. Even though I've only had my new phone a few days shy of a week - it's been a great investment - I'm reasonably hard on phones and so far this one has remained scratch free despite coins, keys, etc. being introduced to both sides of my device. Do yourself a favor, it adds a bit to the price, but is well worth having it professionally installed. My wife and mother-in-law also had theirs installed on their new iPhones and have had no issues....
I wanted to make sure my Iphone 4 was scratch free for as long as possible so I purchased the "ZAGG InvisibleSHIELD". First of all the front plastic wasn't even cut right, the home button was semi covered. Then after a few days in my pocket the bottom started rolling off and collecting lint. I have now cleaned and reapplied the front twice in under a week. For $30 this is not good.
It might have great durability but good luck installing it correctly, it stretches pretty easliy and after installing it on my phone 48 hours later a bunch of lint got under the film from being in my pocket and rendered it useless. At least they warrently it, right? Ask my Rep @ AT&T about them and he offered the last customer a refund after the Rep tried to install it and failed as well.
I have used several other screen protectors before and this was by far the worst one. It is made of a stretchy jelly like material that is IMPOSSIBLE to position correctly without bubbles under it. Even when I finally got it positioned correctly (still with a thousand bubbles) there was a very slight overhand from the edge of the glass. They didnt even cut the screen the right size...wow. I do not understand how such a bad product can be sold to consumers. T
These are by far the best looking and most durable screen protectors out there. Most of the negative feedback I've read is with the installation. You really need to take your time and use a generous amount of the spray on your hands and on the adhesive side of the protector film. You want it real wet so when you place it on the screen you can slide it around without having to peel it up to reposition each time. Also, make sure you have every spec of dust off of the glass screen before placing the protector on. I keep a can of air dust remover close by and blow every spec of dust off right before I place the protector on. It's easy to get it on perfect if you follow these steps. I bought the front protector only but now I wish I had gotten the back protector too. Too bad they don't sell the back separate. Now I have to buy a full coverage kit to get the back piece. Looks much nicer and sleeker using the protectors instead of bulking up the phone and giving it a cheap look putting it in a case.
It's not a great cover. Should have spent 10 more bucks!
Bought this for my boyfriend. He uses his phone all the time for work and personal. This case keeps it safe and protects it from scratchs. Excellent product.
Nice case and colors. Good non-slip grip. Good protection for my iPhone.
I bought this to replace another Iphone cover that lasted about 9 months. This cover is far more durable than others and worth the extra money. It is not as bulky as the larger Otter Box covers so I don't expect it to protect the phone like the larger bulkier models. It has flaps that protect the power slot and the bottons and plugs on top from dust that seem difficult at first until you get used to them. Good solid protection for a moderately abused phone.
I have never owned an iPhone before this phone so I am pleasantly surprised. I was very hyped up to buy this phone. Coming from using a BlackBerry for around 5 years. From the 8310 all the way up to the torch. The display is very clear & vivid. The OS is quick, responsive to touch and does not lag. It has never frozen or caused me any trouble. Everything is easy to use. iTunes and iCloud are a bit of a disappointment. I was able to use my BB as an external hard drive. iPhone needs to be sync'd in order to obtain files. There are thousands of apps to choose from and are generally very helpful. Honestly I can find nothing wrong with this phone at all aside for the battery life for a heavy user. My phone is plugged in a good part of the day so battery life is great. Data is fast, great camera, vivid screen, and over all feels very well built. Overall a great phone.
This is a great phone that offers a lot of functionality. There are apps out there for almost anything you could ever need to do, and tons of them are free. The user interface is very simple to figure out - even my mother can use it. There are a few drawbacks though. For one thing, I absolutely hate iTunes. I feel this program is probably the weak link in Apple's chain of otherwise wonderful smartphone. Another thing that can be troublesome is the auto correct feature. While this service is usually helpful it can also be an annoyance when it changes things incorrectly. Also, the battery doesn't last forever, but that's to be expected with any smartphone and the battery life is still seemingly years longer than that of most Android phones. Overall, I think this is a great phone that both techies and noobs can embrace.
Got this to replace my Samsung Impression (which I hated) and 5-yr old banged-up iPod Classic. I am very happy with this iPhone! Very easy to use and has plenty of space for songs, apps, photos, etc.
This phone is noticeably faster than the 3GS. The display is really improved.
When I hold this phone it just feels good. It's solid and easy for me to use. The glass front and back with steel band around the perimeter exudes class. I have this phone with me all the time and it replaces my computer in useful ways. It plays movies, music, podcasts. It records video, takes pictures and records sound. It even talks to me in sometimes silly ways. I asked Siri the other day to name Snow Whites' Seven Dwarfs. It replied, "The Seven Dwarfs". How rich is that? Overall, I'm happy I bought this phone. I talk, it listens. It talks, I listen. What a partnership!
This is an incredible smart phone. Fast, easy to use and it just works. Incredible amount of apps to chose from. A few minor glitches with it hanging, but just turn the phone off, turn it back on and all is well. Why would anyone want anything different? Apple has perfected the simple and effortless user experience, including the ability to plug this into your Mac and transfer everything over is a snap.
Great phone really keeps things organized. It is a great step up from 3GS
I love this phone! I get much longer battery life than I ever did with my 3G. The picture quality is awesome and its MUCH faster downloads. It doesnt drop calls all the time like my 3G did on a daily basis. The only things to complain about is that the battery gets really hot when charging and Siri is useless. It doesnt understand me when I talk and English is my only language. I dont have any accents like a southern accent etc. The only thing it will find is a massage parlor in Fresno lol.
The phone works great, no problems. Very speedy and easy to use.
battery life on this phone seems to exhaust faster than my older 3gs would have been a better deal but was not informed of promotions on all other phones available for my ATT upgrade
Easy to use, and intuitive to navigate around. This phone has oodles of space for photos, videos and apps. Siri is amusing to use, but needs a lot of help in understanding some of what I say... Acronyms are pretty much a lost cause - but I have not used it that much. Power lasts well if WiFi, Location Services and Bluetooth are turned off; otherwise it seems hit or miss. Maybe it depends on the strength of the signal. This is the first smart phone I have used, the last device coming anywhere near it was a Sony Clie - short battery life and loss of power leading to loss of data killed that for me. I feel organised and in control of my life with the iPhone. It connects easily to car and hearing aid bluetooth devices and switches between them on the fly as I get out of, or into my car; the only complaint here is that you cannot name each device - my wife and I both have Fords with Sync - they each appear as 'Sync' in the list - not a problem with 2, but if I rent cars I have to remember to delete the appropriate one each time. I have only had it a month, but would not be without it...
It has a lot of nice features over my 3GS. However the battery life is still not that good. I start to run low after using it all day and sometimes completely drain the battery by 7:00 or 8:00 PM.
First, about BestBuy Mobile: Absolutely the best. And they were able to save my old unlimited data plan, an option which AT&T didn't tell me existed! Pro: Much faster response; much greater memory available; good camera; download speeds (on AT&T) are much faster than straight 3G (almost 4G). Con: Still prone to freezes, lockups, and app crashes; voice quality lagging behind the phones that once were (Motorola StarTac, etc.); AT&T service (bars, ability to access data network in busy locations, etc.) still seems to lag behind iPhone users on Verizon or Sprint. Conclusion: Glad I have it, but, like most high tech devices these days, it's a bit buggy, and AT&T still has some work to do.
This is the best phone out there. Period. It does everything.
The iPhone 4S is really a great phone but there are some weird issues. For example- Facetime sound sometimes just stops working and the fix is to turn the iPhone off and back on (what is it a windows bug?) The only other issue I have is probably with AT&T and not the phone but I keep dropping calls.
i delayed getting an iPhone until now, because I was afraid to go to a touchscreen keypad and had been accustomed to my BlackBerry tactile keyboard. I will get over the typing mistakes because I absolutely love everything about this phone. I bought an iPad about 6 months ago, so this was almost a seamless transition. The iPhone has all the same functionality plus telephone capability, so what's not to like? In my case, I also have a MacBook Pro as my computer, so the three integrate and talk to each other very well, thanks to the iCloud improvements. The camera is great and easy to use and the Siri assistant works well, also.
This is my third iPhone and I have had no problems with any of them except for one, 3gs with bad gps chip worked fine after exchange. So if you are going to spend the money buy something that works. Don't waste it on the other guys like android a friend is on her 7 android and it is still malfunctioning maybe it is just sprint.
Easy to use and is faster than the iPhone 3GS I had before this purchase. Recommend it and Best Buy for purchase to everyone.
This phone was a replacement for my iPhone 4. It suffered an unfortunate accident and had to be replaced. This phone does not seem any faster, and Siri is hit and mostly miss. My biggest concern is the battery life which drains MUCH faster than its predecessor. So, overall it's the same phone I had, but with worse battery life. wooo ....
do you expect anything less than the best from apple... it is an awesome phone... an awesome toy... and i love suri... so do my grandkids... lol..
I had an iPhone 4 and was going to wait on the 5. Then I read it will probably be later in 2012, so I opted to get the 4s 64GB. I use Siri constantly and I use the large drive as a jump drive - one less thing to carry. As for Best Buy, this is my first purchase of an iPhone from them (1st, Apple Store, 2nd & 3rd AT&T.) By far this was the best purchasing experience I've ever had. The salesperson was extremely knowledgable, took minutes to set up (also waited no longer than 5 minutes for her) and took great care to get me out perfectly setup (changed my plan - my idea) and quickly! 110% great!!
I was always an Android user- not any more! I was sold on how easy and smooth the iPhone 4S is to operate. So much better than Android which was always freezing up and crashing apps. I have had no problems with the iPhone 4S. The selection of apps is amazing- so much to choose from! Call clarity is excellent. The picture is crystal clear- and the camera is easy to use.
I had an iphone 3gs and was debating whether or not to spend the money for the 4S; I'm glad I did because I love the phone. It works much better than the 3 and the features on the 4 relates to my ipad2 much better than before. I'm glad I took the chance.
I've had every model of iPhone, but this one is by far the best. Several of my friends that have android phones played with mine and, yep, guess what? They too ordered the new 4S. The camera is excellent. Fast processor. Siri is great. And the phone is beautiful.
I am sure the phone will be great but the folks in Jonesboro deserve a big attaboy. I got there Sunday after the big game in Fayetteville, right after closing. It was the only time I had to get a preorder. They allowed me to come in and get my preorder. They did not have too and have won a fan. That is the way to work for the customer!!!
I can Imessage from my old phone (IPone 4) and IPad 2 at my house. With the my new phone (IPhone 4S) it only works when it feels like it. Most of the time I have to Imessage from my IPad 2. It drops calls even when I am in Logan. AT&T is suppose to cover the Preston area. Most of the time I cant even get a signal in Preston. It is suppose to load the internet faster when in 4G areas. Well it is actually slower then my old phone with that also. Over all I am not very happy with it especially when you figure how much I payed for it.
Take a charger with you everywhere you go. You'll need it!
Battery Dies very quick during the day even without use. Siri does not always understand my voice and will change my messages. I was expecting a lot more features than it is actually capable of. But it does sync to my car and I love the hands free talk and text. even though it isn't totally hands free, you still have to hold in the button or pick it up to your ear to access Siri. Has good strong signal. Overall its ok but not great.
Just upgraded from iphone3 to the 4s. Siri is awesome, moves alot faster. I'm very satisfied with this purchase.
Be sure to have backed up your old information. Very happy with it though.
Well my son returned the HTCOneX and got this Iphone 4S (Downgrade?). What matters is that he is happy with the battery life that the Iphone 4S offers but it it too restrictive, in my opinion. He jailbroked it and now it can be tweaked, he has done some crazy stuff to it now (including downloading free stuff) but still the screen is too small and he will be missing any future critical Apple updates for the device.
Upgraded from a 3GS. All the bells & whistles are as good or better than advertised. New features (Face-Time, camera flash &tc.) are hum-dingers. Everything works flawlessly. Speed is jsut what I'd expect. Main motivator for the upgrade for me was the actual wi-fi hotspot function. A little faster communications for my MacBook Pro when I'm out of wi-fi range. The tethering with the bluetooth was effective, but a bit slow. The camera with its great resolution and flash are a great enhancement, and the 4G communication is pretty much the cat's pajamas. The only thing I can see that really needs improvement is SIRI. It does not recognize my queries or commands. Seems to be regression from the original voice-dial utility. But for this one short-coming, an outstanding bit of technical convenience turned necessity.
I really like the I phone 4S, it is much faster than the 3G I had. I use the SIRA all the time it has really come in handy.
First apple product I bought. Has a lot more stuff than a Blackberry to plan your day, week, month, and years. Great camera. Tons of apps to choose from. A lot more memory than I thought. Holds what I need. Don't second guess this phone, GET IT!
Great phone except directions on hou to use it. Thank god I had a iPad which helpes a lot.
Moved to the iPhone 4S from the 3GS. Big difference. Better reception, better battery life and faster. Better camera also. Overall great phone.
Well now on my third phone. I have the 4s and had a problem with the phone randomly shutting down during the course of the day for about. 20 minutes at a time. The best buy clerk was not helpful and wanted to give me a refurbished phone even though it was in the 30 day trial period. This phone seems to be working fine now. But I would be Leary to going to best buy again. Was not treated with customer service.
Excellent telephone, excellent mp3 player, easy to use and navigate. The only thing that has been a disappointment is the voice activation feature, it works but requests need to be repeated multiple times before the phone understands. Other wise it works great.
Love the iCloud sync that moves pics, calendar notations, messages between iPhone, iPad.
Would like Best Buy to offer a class on using iPhones to help those of us who are new to this technology.
Love the phone. Was a little worried about the keyboard, but I love it. Easy to use.
I love playing with my iphone, it can do so much and siri makes it easy to set up reminders for myself so that I don't forget to do things.
Awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Great phone best I've ever had. Great service, fantastic apps.
I went to buy a wireless connection for my laptop so I could use it anywhere and ended up with the iphone 4s smart phone. This does everything I was going to do with the laptop. Siri is fun to play with and helps keep your hands free while driving. . I would like louder speakers and longer battery life otherwise I'm quite satisfied with this smart phone. I also recommend buying a car power adapter to charge while driving.
This phone has some cooler features. Love the calendar.
Ever since switching to the iPhone, I would never switch to another kind of phone again. It has all the features I need, and then some. Has great coverage (I use AT&T) and with the life-proof case, it's virtually indestructible (I go 4-wheeling alot in places like Pismo beach and Glamis and use my phone to keep in touch with stragglers)
Received random text messages/offers. Overall I am very happy with my purchase!
Overall I am thrilled with my new iPhone purchase. it has been a long time in the making and took yet another smartphone failure for me to decide to give apple products a try. I love the forward and rear facing camera. Photo and Viedo quality are good for a smartphone. Size is great for front pant pocket storage. If time proves this machine to continue performing as great as its initial impression, then we will share along partnership.
I have used an iPhone since the 3G model. Last month I bought a Samsung Galaxy II Note for the larger screen size. I took it back after 3 days. The screen size was great but the wider size hurt this old guy's hand. I had a lot of problems synchronizing my data with my PC using the Samsung/Android system . I bought the new iPhone 4S and in just 5 minutes after I brought it home I had all my apps updated and all my data snychronized. I believe that Apple has the right idea in that the hardware and software are designed to work together.
This is my first phone with a data plan and I love it. I love how easy it is to type-text or to talk-text and I use the reminder feature all day long. I hate that my battery dies from me using phone so much. But otherwise I wouldn't change a thing.
I've been using iPhones since the 3G with never a disappointment and this is one is no exception. It runs as smoothly as ever and hasn't had a RAM bottleneck yet (the main problem I've had with Android devices). Siri is fun and as useful a feature as Apple has added in a long time. The only drawback to this particular phone is the storage size. I've been collecting songs and apps for iPhones a long time and 16 gigs isn't enough to store it all. I sold my 32 gig iPhone 4 for $170.00 and that meant this phone was only $30.00 out of pocket, but now I regret not shelling out the extra $100.00 for the 32 gig model.
I've tried a few smartphones over the years, but honestly, never been able to beat my iPhone.
Great camera, battery could be a little better but it is all around a good phone. :)
I have not used my phone for multiple reasons. I was given a phone number that still listed under the previous owners name, andthe past owners name still comes up.. Also, I have to download information to my iphone which I do not know how to execute. I am wondering if I should take the phone back. It remains untouched in my living room. I am disappointed in that I could not just purchase my iphone and begin to use it immediately.
traded in my iphone 4 30gb,got a bonus 50.00 gift car bonus. walked out with a new phone and 100.00 gift card after my trade in. awsome!!!! the only thing- the new phone has a rattle when you tap it. minor but it's there. google it. its not enough for me to warrant a replacement.
Very easy to use and Siri feature is great. Email and internet features very fast.
After using few greater than 4 inch screen mobiles, iPhone doesn't seem to be relevant in the competition & its doesn't seem to give better experience these days.
iPhone is pretty good. Users can easilyy navigate, easy setup and very good camera. Short battery life, if tunned for better battery life, should compromise on other feature and appearence.
Everyone is hung up on the Apple craze right now, i think they are blind or biased to stay popular. The phone is good but not great, I also have an Evo 3d which is faster, has a much bigger and equally as nice display, and can do anything my iPhone can and more. Granted it requires a little more technical aptitude, but it's far from complex. I do experience times of lag with my iPhone and application crashes, it's far from flawless. Good, but far from perfect. I think everyone needs to get over this Apple craze, there's better products out there.
I had an android phone and hated it. Love this one.
I love this phone. My only complaint is AT&T. Which can't be blamed on the phone.
iPhone 4S continues the ongoing evolution of a great smart phone platform.
100% better than the Samsung Captivate I turned in.
I have a problem with the voice recognition of Siri.
Best phone by far love so much about it, perfect for texting, gaming, keeping up to date with all my personal business and special dates. Takes the best pictures for a cell phone.
I am constantly finding new ways to utilize the iPhone 4s. Siri is fantastic. This is the best phone I have ever owned. I like it much better than my Android based Smart Phone.
like the siri application , and the camera overall i am still new to this so am learning as i go with help from my son and grandchildren!
I learn a lot when I run into issues such as when I accidently zoom my whole screen -- the fix was easy actually once I figured it out but this is what Steve Jobs had in mind when he designed his products -- keep it simple so they can figure it out -- and I do! I love my i4s -- I've sported the i4 the past 2 years, i can't see going to another brand of phone. The quality and user friendly interfaces make my life simpler and more organized -- i'm a 51 year old female mother of 4 grown kids who love texting as much as I do...there just is not a better way to have fun with a phone and doing it mi way. The usability is like none other I've experienced -- a product I'm proud to use and own -- the Apple of my i.
Had no trouble using this phone! LOVE IT! I just upgraded from a 4 to a 4s, the only difference is that one talks and the other does not.
Great addition to the apple family. Its fast, sleek and easy to use.
If you are reading this review you obviously have never owned an iPhone, and for that I am sorry. There is no better phone on the market and if there is, its the iPhone 5 which isn't available yet! Easy to use, solid build and keep in mind its the BMW of resale value. Buy this phone (esp on contract) and you are guaranteed to make money at the end of your 2 year contract. The apps and the user experience is what makes Apple better than the rest. If you want buggyness, and bad apps then go elsewhere!
my new phone has opened up new vistas for me. a lot of cool apps. face time.
The phone is easy to use, but the best part was the man that helped me at Best Buy, he knew what he was doing and was so helpful.
I like this phone better that my old 3gs. It takes great pictures
What's not great about this phone? Ok maybe the battery is a little disappointing, but that's with most smart phones. To start, the camera is awesome. The additional fifth optical lens makes all the difference in the world. I can stand side by side with someone shooting with an iPhone 4 or an Android and the picture is so much crisper, not too mention you can shoot in much darker settings than normal because of it. The A5 processor is awesome as well. Graphics are handled perfectly, you have no issue with multitasking, and the games handle perfectly on it. I guess i'll say I wish I had opted for a 32 or 64gb 4S since shooting 1080P does take a lot of memory. But that's something you can learn to manage using an iOS device. As far as the retina display, it's not any different from the 4, but it's awesome. SIRI...what's not too like? It takes a little getting used to speaking commands, but once you've got it down, it just works. I have no problem adding calendar events, sending texts and emails (with only minimal spelling problems)...and you can still control which songs you want her to play as well. Best part...try looking for a place on the map or a phone number for a restaurant...it just works. It's awesome! Get the iPhone 4S if you don't have a 4. You won't regret moving up. The 4, I won't really justify moving up just for SIRI, but you'll not be disappointed if you do make the jump as well.
It's great! It's an iPhone 4s... You expected something different??? Warning! Siri and iMessage uses tons of data!
I bought this iphone 4S to replace my 3G. Very easy to use and super fast.
I've had the iPhone 3G8 and the 3G16 and now the 4GS 16. I am really enjoying the camera and video quality. Makes me not even need my regular camera. I also like the dictating feature for texting, and emails. Siri is NOT the best as we have a few problems with pronunciation of some of my contacts, but she has come in handy a few times.
Bought the 4S as a replacement for my wife's 3G. She loved the phone (mostly the Screen and SIRI). But the first day my son accidentally dropped it on the floor -- before we'd found a case / screen protector -- and the front glass shattered. I mean it splintered into hundreds of pieces. Spiderweb cracks across the entire face of the phone. And of course, if the glass breaks, Apple assumes it is abuse and will not cover it ... they will not even consider that the phone might have been defective. If the screen breaks, you buy it. And they want to charge you $199 to fix it. But of course if you negotiate, they will come down to $149 -- the largest reduction local store managers are authorized to make. And while I was at Apple, and later at the place I actually got it repaired, I literally saw dozens of phones brought in with the same problem. There is a huge cottage industry that has built up to repair broken iPhone screens --and other phone types of course. So, if you buy a 4S, either buy some form of insurance, or make sure you have a good case/screen protector, or both, before you take it out of the box.
Overall a great phone. I'm definately becoming an apple person. Unlike some Apple Addicts I have had and use other OS's android and I even had a windows phone back in the day. Apple is still the easiest of the group and they are the leading edge for their market. Siri is still a little buggy, but its a start and to me better than the other voice recognition out there. Plus what other VR lets you ask it random silly questions? 4 to 4s I really don't see the need for the upgrade as it's not really that much faster, but from the 3gs its the only way to go. Spend the extra money, trust me.
Love the Iphone - works as advertised. A 50 dollar discount plus a trade-in of my Blackberry Torch got me the Iphone for less than half the normal price of an upgrade. Process was smooth; the only reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 is that the sales girl sold me a screen cover I didn't need. Bought an Otter Box case that already had a cover (she said it did not). I returned the extra screen cover later with no hassle.
Impressed. Easy to use. First apple product. Will buy again
I love the 4S!! I am so glad I findly got it!!!!!!!
This is an amazing phone, camera, computer. the graphics are a must see, my pictures come out perfect every time even the bad ones.
My wife had an iPhone 3GS and returned it after 2 days. When she saw the 4S advertised on TV she really wanted to get one though. So she did and absolutely loves it. I believe the new shape/form combined with Siri is what really made the difference for her from the older one. I recommend for any iPhone user or anyone that doesn't want to customize their phone a lot. I personally like android and love my new Skyrocket., bit that is a didfferent review.
The phone has everthing I need and more. The only reason why I didn't rate it excellent was the battery life. I wish it was a little longer.
Love it! Siri is a great feature that only gets better the more you utilize her.
This is my 3rd iPhone so I'm hooked... however, Siri doesn't respond well while using bluetooth. This makes it virtually useless while driving which is the primary reason I would use voice activation - so my hands are free. Seems like this is the case with any background noise. Could be improved.
love all the features and the apps complete the package - if you are going to have a cell phone the only choice is an IPhone 4S
Just as I expected, this iPhone is hands down the best smartphone out there. The only gripes I have are a slightly yellow tint to the screen and software issues such as the mail client and syncing with other third party office products. The hardware is exceptional.
Love it. This is the best iPhone yet. I'm amazed by all the cool things it can do and I absolutely love Siri. My only concern is, I have a lot of dropped calls which I did not have before I upgraded. At first I thought it was my service provider but now I am not so sure. Sometimes I will be on a call and it will drop 3-4 times in one 20-30 minute conversation.
We replaced my old 3GS with this one for my wife. She is quite happy with it.
I am excited to finally own this smartphone. Love the look, love the easy use. I had to have a couple of "training sessions", but I am good to go now. I don't go anywhere without it!!
I am so happy I purchased the 4s! I spent a lot of time debating on whether I would upgrade to a new Android phone or if I would move over to an iPhone. I love the Android operating system and am an avid Google user. The hardest transition to this phone was the lack of Google Navigation with voice provided, turn -by-turn directions & the lack of a true Google Talk app. However the phone over-all more than made up for my 2 favorite android apps and I did find similar substitutes for the iPhone. And Siri is a trip! She also makes going hands free much easier. The phone is easy to use and isn't as glitchy as my previous phone. I think anyone would be happy with the 4s.
at first for a couple years when android came out I was hesitant about iPhone , however when this one came out I would always try to go play with it and wanted it more more and then my husband convinced me to just get it which we both did and I actually like it, I really don't care Anymore about the "personalization" android gave cuz at the end it was just too much caos, this phone actually has many shortcuts that I've been discovering each day which is awesome because i like making use of a smartphone ! After all that is what a smartphone is for despite the Mandy's cons it has many pros when put to use. If u don't know shortcuts already look them up or attend a Workshop and make use of such awesome phone Pros  keyboard typing is on point ! Video/camera are awesome Many apps for ios are excellent! iPhoto now available on iPad and iPhone which I was waiting for Quick responses Overall I do enjoy more than my Samsung nexus Cons/ needs fixing Battery life worse After recent update Wish ringtones were easier to create/install Many apps that we're available on android market are not available on apple app market like for example the one I miss most is the "mr number" which blocks annoying calls telemarketer calls etc, can't understand why apple wouldn't let that be in market  Wish iCloud had more storage for backup and syncing without having to pay for more storage  Sometimes people can't hear me
They weren't kidding when they said this is the best iPhone yet. I absolutely love everything about it from the brilliant beautiful display to the fantastically fast A5 chip inside. Siri is a dream and responds to me immediately. She'll even call a place that's not listed in your address book as long as you give her the name of the place and the basic address. This worked for me when calling a local restaurant in a hurry to catch someone before they left. Pair the iPhone with a bluetooth earpiece and you can get all kinds of information without even looking at the phone. If you're disabled, iPhone and Siri are great, depending on your disability. Push the button on your earpiece and do what you need all while still wheeling along.
Excellent phone, wish it would let you use your songs as ringtones like blackberry torch, instead of going through a lot of steps
Battery charge could be longer. Siri does not always respond properly Great photo quality Clear connection
Love it!! Can't live without it. The apps are fantastic. The quality is fantastic. I've never been an Apple person before the iPhone, but I'm going to buy an iPad just to support Apple. And now I have 4G speed on AT&T.
I had a Samsung charge 4G LTE...... The iPhone 4s is far superior in every way from the quality of the hardware to the quality of the software you will not go wrong if you choose the Apple iPhone 4s I liked my Driod ...... I love my iPhone !!
Since I bought my first iPhone, I can't buy any other phone than the newest iPhone.
I'm a non-techie person who wanted a simple smart phone. I had a Blackberry, but hated the tiny keys and screen. The iPhone 4s has a much better screen and the on-screen keyboard is a great improvement, especially since I can use a stylus, rather than my fingers. I still have a great deal to learn about the device, but I've found that it's easy to navigate through and downloads are a snap. I love the ability to synch with my iPad through iCloud, and iTunes.
I've had this phone for 1 month, so far I've had no problems with it. It's fast when loading apps. The call quality is crystal clear. It takes great pictures. I haven't tried the video so can't comment on that. All in all I'm very satisfied with this phone.
The IPhone is absolutely the fastest and most reliable product we have ever purchased.
I have never been an Apple fanboy, but this phone might turn me into one. Everything about it is intuitive and easy to use, and fast, it respond to everything immediately. The built-in apps have been great, and I quickly found the app store to be addictive. I have nearly filled the phone, just with free apps. The only real negative I've encountered so far, is that it cannot give different email addresses different notification sounds. When I get an email, I don't know if it's from work, and therefore high priority, or if it's my personal account, and can wait, without the use of a paid app (which app, MailTones, does work really well). This is my first smart phone, and it is amazing. Very happy with my purchase.
I've got a chance to use the last 3 different iPhones that have come out and have thoroughly enjoyed the new features on this one. Compared to the 4, it runs faster, looks better, and best of all, has Siri.
I only gave it 4 stars because of the battery life, the 4 had a much longer battery life. Other than that the phone is great.
Took me years before i would break down and buy a Apple product. Now i wish i wouldnt have waited so long.
My second iphone, I'm addicted. not crazy about siri, but the new camera is awesome!! takes great pictures. like the square edges versus the rounded of my 3GS. i find siri kind of useless. i can look up my own stuff on the internet. probably lots of features i don't even know about yet. just a great product and apple's customer service is superior!
I bought my first Iphone 4s and I love it. It was a fast and easy purchace with the staff knowing exactly what to do. I would buy there again. Thank you
I upgraded from a 3GS so this was a major improvement. Pros: 1. Better cell reception 2. Screen resolution is excellent 3. Very responsive - especially when the camera is being used to take shot. 4. Camera image/video quality is excellent 5. Love Siri - works most of the time Cons: 1. Apple should have made it look different from the 4 as it looks identical. Overall, ,love it. :)
I love how well the Iphone works. Rock solid on everything it does. All apps work great. There are a very things that I don't understand. For example why do I have to drill down thee menu levels to turn bluetooth on/off? The same for the wifi. Why can I create an on/off button on the home screen?
This is my fourth iPhone and they just keep getting better! I wouldn't buy anywhere but Best Buy. I love the sales people and the buy-back program.
The new phone was turned off automatically when not in use. We brought back to AT&T in Best Buy about 3 weeks after purchase. They reinstalled the program and the progam did not go. We went back to AT&T in Best Buy on the 31st days after purchase, AT&T guys acknowledged the problem but they said it's too late for an exchange (over 30-day free exchange period). I don't understand why did not exchange the phone when we first went back to Best Buy. Extremely disappointed with AT&T and Best Buy!
I love my new iphone 4s but I hate the fact that the battery life stinks. I have to constantly charge my phone, in the car, at work and at home. Please fix this
Almost everything about the iphone 4 is terrific - except, of course, for the phone itself. Phoning is awkward, requiring many actions, and not allowing for shortcuts. But the beauty of the iphone is the apps and Siri. If and when ATT comes through with an accessible 4G network maybe even the dropped calls will stop. Now if only battery life were improved....
Need to be able to put check marks to add photos to a email
love everything apple. until i found out their security is worthless. look up jail break. stealing your info takes 5 minutes. i love apple and couldn't believe how easy my info was stolen. at&t and apple would do nothing. very disappointed.
I bought this phone because I truly needed a new one. I had my blackberry for 6 years and it did not work properly anymore. I bought this phone and completely liked it BUT.... it got 2x frozen in a month, I could not switch off this phone, I tried to make a picutre of my friend and it got frozen, it got so hot so then I finally went back to Bestbuy and exchange it for a new one. Luckily I did not owe the phone for more then month otherwise I would not be able to do it. ... so far I love it very much and Bestbuy provided a good service when I exchanged my phone. ..
Awesome phone! Can't live without it! Only think I don't like is the battery life, but thats easily manageable.
Only thing I wish is that it was the iPhone 5. It is soooo much faster than the 3G and the picture quality is 10x faster
A big step up from my old 3GS in terms of speed. Battery life is good for a smartphone. Siri is not as cosmic as the ads portray it, but has certainly come in handy. Reception is better than the 3GS. I stayed with AT&T to keep my unlimited data plan, so the I still get a fair number of dropped calls -- otherwise I would give 5 stars.
I have had this phone for one month now almost exactly. I put it in a case the day I bought it, have yet to drop it, and it sits off in my car or in my desk droor while I'm at work. The phone locked up on my today. It would not even shut off no matter how long I held any button. Once that battery was completely drained and I pulgged the phone in was I able to restart the phone. My wife has an HTC Inspire droid. The only reason I got this phone was that I could play my music, Pandora and Utube, through USB on my car radio. It was way over priced. I will not be buying an iPhone next time.
all the great functions of the older 3gs i had and great new functions i wanted. YEAH :0)
The only thing that is frustrating is the sound recognition of the 4S. When I want to send a text or e-mail by voice, the phone does not pick-up my words. I have to go in and edit what the phone misunderstood. The reason I went with the 4S instead of 4G is because of this feature. A little disappointing.
I love it so far. I hate the location of the mute button when I'm in a call
The iPhone 4S is by far the greatest iPhone yet. I have tried Android phones, but I always come back to the iPhone. Every time they update the phone, they release a slew of new features. iCloud is something I have been waiting for for years. Google does an adequate job on the android front to mimic this feature, but they still can't seem to get it right. Keep up the good work Apple, you have a customer for life.
not much different than 4 - that's it. battery is actually worse and siri is far from being mastered. still by far the best smartphone out there though. WARNING: DO NOT GET TRICKED INTO BUYING MOPHIE JUICE PACK CASES-->COST $85 (YA, FOR THE CHEAP ONE!) BUT ISN'T WORTH $50-->MAKES PHONE CUMBERSOME W/NO NOTICABLE/SIGNIFICANT EXTRA BATTERY POWER---EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED THAT I TORCHED $85 HARD-EARNED BONES.
I had a 3GS 2 years ago and I really loved it but I wanted to try Android so i decided and went with a HTC Inspire 4G. Liked it, but had a lot of issues with freezing up. Then finally, it got stolen! So I decided to go back to iPhone and went with the 4S! IT IS AMAZING! The dual-core processor in this phone just blows my Inspire out of the water! Siri is just simply cool, even though Android has a voice recognition app too. But this has a personality and I've spent a couple of hours just playing with Siri and I really didn't run into any problems. The rear camera take really good pictures, but really no difference from my android ( both have an 8 megapixels). I've also come to enjoy the front facing camera and actually FaceTime an old HS friend of mine, which was awesome! Only con is battery life, but I know that's because I'm using Location Services and I use it a lot for music so that's my fault. Once I turn off LS, my battery life is a lot better. Overall, I love this phone and I don't think I will go back to Android. Now, all of my old stuff I had for my old iPhone like my alarm clock dock will finally be used again! Plus this phone, my Kenwood DDX418 and a cable will allow me to have GPS navigation in my car. If you haven't made the switch, please do so. You will not regret it!
IPhone 4s is a great product. I was already familiar with the product because research was already done. What was great about the experience was the Best Buy representative, who gave great service to assure that I understood exactly how to operate the phone. Keep up the great work and continue providing great products
First week or so it was great.... then the software update. Now the phone doesn't want to stay connected to the network. I thought it was just an AT&T issue... but seems there are 60 pages on Apples site regarding this issue from people all over the world with the 4s and Apple has yet to make any response to it. It has worked solidly now for 2 days after i taped the sim card in place... which i know sounds weird believe me but it seems to be working for the moment. Anymore issues and I'll be leaving the iphone for good... the 3g never had these problems, it was slow, but effective.
This phone is the best hands down. It's ashame to ruin it with AT&T service but I am not going to take that away from the phone. Only thing that annoys me is the SIRI. It likes to pop up randomly for no reason some times. Droid cant compete with this phone though. Apple created a monster.
Love it. Great time saver. BestBuy wireless folks did a great job as usual setting everything up. Transferred all my info off a 12 year old phone. Very happy with purchase and BestBuy service.
I love this phone, it's a phone and a mini computer all in one. The only problem I have is that for as much as the phone costs, the battery life is really short. other than that , it's perfect.
I upgraded from an iPhone 3G. The 4S is blazingly fast. Apps that crashed on the 3G run perfectly on the 4S. The camera and video capability are vastly improved. I travel quite a bit throughout Northeast Ohio and I have few problems with signal strength. I have had no battery problems that have been reported. I have always highly recommended the iPhone.
Great phone. Easy set up. You can't really expect anything less than that from Apple.
My wife bought my I phone for christmas. I was a blackberry user before this and there is no comparison between the two. I love my I phone; it's like having a computer in your pocket.
You can't delete photos/pictures downloaded off the library or folders which is very frustrating.
I already loved my iPhone 4, so when this one came out I wasn't sure it would be a big deal. However, Siri is very awesome and it is easy to use. Very helpful and fun. PICTURES are amazing!!!!
As a mobile application developer, I looked long and hard at the Android offerings. While it was tempting, I just couldn't pull the trigger yet on choosing Android over iPhone. I replaced my 3+ year old iPhone 3G with the iPhone 4s. I'm amazed at the speed of the dual core A5 chip. I kept my unlimited AT&T data plan and the 3G is indeed much quicker with the HSPA+ backhaul. My only complaint is that there isn't any 4G LTE support. However, by the time the wireless carriers have upgraded their networks, the iPhone 6 will be out.
Compared to my droid this phone is 10x better, easier to use, and double the battery life.
This iPhone 4S rocks! Very user friendly, and Siri is an awesome personal assistant. If you are a social network junkie, the iPhone 4S will keep you in the now with easy apps that bridge the gap between the you and every popular social networking site...Astounding!
I love this iphone. It's seriously one of my best purchase decisions ever. I pay a ridiculous amount for the service compared to my old cell phone plan, but it's worth it. I use it all the time. I'm amazed at the amount of apps available and all of the things it will do. It's beautifully designed and works flawlessly. I went with the 16GB. Time will tell if this was a good choice, or if I should have chosen a model with more storage, but I wanted to make sure that I would use it before putting more money into it. The SIRI feature is fun. I haven't used it much yet, and it's still a little buggy, but I understand that it's a feature still in beta testing. I have no regrets, which is a great feeling.
Phone is nice. I was only unhappy with the way my phone contacts were transferred. I have a very different looking jumbled contact list with many duplicate contacts and many did not transfer.
I would recommend this to anyone. It is user friendly and lots of fun. I was a blackberry user until I bought an ipod touch and then I knew I wanted an iphone. I just wish they were a little cheaper. Love the face time and netflix.
Love the Phone. Would not change if you paid me. Never had a phone I use so much. I like the fact that it has an Ipod and Siri is awesome.
This phone is the best phone I've ever owned. It does everything it says it does and more. Love it!!!!
The iPhone 4S is by far the best smartphone overall. Improvements in speed and overall performance over the 4 is very noticeable. The camera is just amazing, I no longer bother with my dedicated camera. Video with the stabilization is very impressive for a phone!
Really cool phone. Siri could be more helpful - most times she'll ask if you'd like her to search the web for your question... Google already has a voice feature. Other than that - sweet iPhone.
My old antiquated phone broke so I HAD to buy something new. I admit I am older and not so tech savy. However, I bit the bullet and got the newest iphone. I am surprised that I caught on so quickly to how to use it. Still playing with SIRI, not sure how useful it really will be. I Like all the features ..I can now get so much info with just a touch. This is my first smart phone and I recommend it to you even if you are a novice at smart phones. If I can use it anyone can.
Siri is great! There isn't that much of a difference between iPhone 4 and iPhone 4S, SO, I wouldn't recommend upgrading if you already have iPhone 4.
Not as great as I thought and its expensive. When I click on say... weather app... the keyboard comes up.... and etc. Have to tap 2 or 3 times for any app to come up. My son has the same problem. Farmville app doesn't do at all... its useless.
I love it... Went from the infuse to the iphone and wouldnt go back
I am very happy with this phone. It has all the features I wanted.
This is a great phone, camera and portable computer. Fast action, good screen, plenty of space for apps and it just works. (No Apple fanboy, but if something works, use it!)
4S all that I expected - one tiny annoyance - sometimes there will be a change that was not requested for example, the icons zoomed and it was not clear how it happened. Fortunately Best Buy had a quick tip to fix it!
Nothing comes close to the iPhone... purchased the iPhone 4S through Best Buy, and traded in my old one at the same time. Smooth transaction overall. Will take the same approach when its time to upgrade again in the future.
My wife likes it, buy I on the other hand am not impressed. Cons: Low Battery life with current OS Not 4G, Even though We are on AT&T and it claims it should. Only 8mp Camera Siri only works 25% of the time Pros: Finally added a forward facing camera Very quick Size is just perfect for my wife, Not very clunky like many of the phones out there 1080p Video recording
Loved my iPhone 3GS but it became noticeably slower with the OS5 update. Glad I took advantage of the AT&T upgrade offer and decided to take the plunge. The camera is wonderful and the flash makes a huge difference. It is lightning fast when searching for contacts, calendar items, etc., and the screen's display is so much sharper. Love the iCLoud functionality and convenience, especially with my new iPad2. Siri is a bonus. Fit and finish are beautiful yet the only "con" I would identify is that this phone is much heavier than my 3GS.
Bought this for my daughter for Christmas. She needed a new phone and had always had high-end Android phones so I wasn't sure that she'd like this phone but she LO VES this phone. So glad that I took the chance and got the Iphone.
This phone is absolutely smooth... I am still getting to know Siri, and she is very helpful. I went from a Windows based phone to an Android, then finally to the OS. OS is definately the smoothest and fastest, with ATT. I'm a believer. The only downfall is that this phone is only as good as the case you get to protect it. The screen is super fragile. But I got an Otter Box. Indoor pics could be better. Outdoor pics as incredible. The pic was taken with the front camera...My son was all amazed as you can see...
Wasn't sure if I should take the plunge and upgrade from my 3GS. Glad I did as the 4s is well worth it. Runs faster, smoother, and looks better. The camera itself is worth the upgrade, not to mention Siri- my new girlfriend. Makes my wife jealous. Too bad AT&T gouges you with a $18 upgrade fee.
The new iPhone 4S is a super awesome phone. I love the picture and video taking abilities that it has. Siri is really a neat thing about it too!
I love my IPhone, but I listen to alot of music and I am currently at the max for storage. I should have purchased the 32G IPhone. Again I love my IPhone but I need more space.
This phone is better than the iPhone 3G accept the glass screen is much weaker than the 3G. If you get this phone make sure to get a heavy duty screen protector or be prepares to shell out between 50 to 190 dollars for a replacement screen.
I bought this phone to replace a Blackberry that was having issues. I must say this phone has met and exceeded my expectations of it. I have owned it since the beginning of November, and even now I have no complaints, it's an all around great phone.
I love the new I phone 4S and love all the extra features, the camera, flash, Siri. it is a great phone and I am glad I upgraded.
I'm really enjoying the phone...too bad I have to have it constantly plugged in...the battery life is terrible and Apple hasn't done squat to remedy the problem. Wait until the battery issue is solved before you buy!
I have had the 4S now for about six months. As far as phone cameras go, this 8mp is great. I'm much more likely now to leave my regular camera at home. Also, it is much faster than my 3GS was, and I appreciate the new iPhone-to-iPhone free texting. I have not really used iCloud, except for backing up my phone and iPad - which works fine, so I can't comment on its other features. As you can see, I am pleased with the phone overall, and, I continue to discover new features of the hardware as well as of iOS 5.
My first smartphone the iPhone4s is a great phone. My biggest complaint is the short battery life.
It is everything the hype suggested it would be... very pleased.
Finally made the jump to Iphone and extrememly glad I did. I Use Siri every day - works better than I could have imagined texting, emailing, calendar, reminders, web inquiries, and even quick numeric calculations. Facetime is better that other video chat programs and the camera on the 4s is amazing. Due to way I use the phone, I don't get more than a day or day-and-a-half from the battery (even periodically closing programs and turning off the when not in use).
I just want to say that my overall experience at bestbuy was amazing as always!! My iPhone 4s is just as expected everything about it is easy to use!! I have AT&T and the signal on my phone is amazing everywhere I go!! The camera also takes awesome pics!! My overall experience was wonderful, I would definitely reccomend bestbuy the best place to buy an iPhone, and any type of electronics as far as that goes!'
I love everything about the iPhone. I just recently upgraded from the 3GS. It is well worth the money. For anyone with an iPhone 3GS or below, this is well worth the update; for anyone who has never owned an iPhone: GET ONE!! One of the best features is Siri. Siri puts all the other imitation apps (such as Vlingo) to shame. There's almost nothing you can't do with the iPhone. There are many great apps as well as doodads to attach to it for different uses. For example I have AppRadio which uses my iPhone; not the greatest radio in the world, but it's cool to have. Prior to upgrading my iPhone, I had the Samsung Infuse, my first Android device. I was very impressed with the freedom it gives you to do whatever you want. But I was not happy with the crashes and very short battery life. I was told that all Android devices are this way. The iPhone (even my 3GS) rarely crashed and had a great battery life. Unlike the Infuse, I could probably go a full day without charging my iPhone and not fear it running out of power. So I prefer the stability of the iPhone over the freedom of the Android.
I bought this for my husband to replace his dying Blackberry. He has always been resistant to iPhones and other Apple products, but he quickly changed his mind once I put the 4s in his hand. :) I will say that if you're looking to upgrade from the 4 to the 4s, don't waste your time or your money. The only real difference between the 4 and the 4s is Siri, and she's a bit of a joke. My husband likes to use her, just to try to prove that she works, but he often ends up frustrated and does the work himself. That said, if you don't own an iPhone at all, now is the time to buy one! An iPhone 4 or 4s is definitely a good investment.
Great experience all around at the store. I had a trade-in which I received a good price for to begin with. Then, the sales person walked me through the process of choosing my new phone and a plan to go with it. Total satisfaction...I'm a "Happy Camper"!
I took advantage of Best Buy's 30 day test period and upgraded my IPHONE 3GS to an HTC Inspire. The Inspire was a nice phone, but for 30 days I was continually trying to find ways to do what the IPHONE, and especially ITUNES, can do. Everything is harder on an Android phone, and the Apps and Android Market seem rudimentary. So, on the 30th day I returned the Inspire and spent the $200 for the IPHONE 4S. I was instantly happy, back in my comfort zone where things are easy. 16 GB is plenty for me. I'd also like to add that Best Buy doesn't charge an activation fee, restocking fee, or any other "Clear Coat Paint Option"--they aren't car dealers! Thanks Best Buy, without you I'd be lugging around an Android phone for the next two years.
This phone is my 3rd iphone. Each one was better than the last. Easy to use, powerful and all you need in a smart phone. I love it.
This is my first iphone and I love it. I had an HTC smartphone and it doesn't even compare. The iphone is so much faster to look things up on the internet and easier to use. I definately recommend it.
The phone has an annoying echo. Turning the speaker off and on helps, but the user should not have to do that. Would not buy a again.
I used my upgrade to get the new iPhone 4S and I'm glad I did! This phone is AWESOME!!! Looks like I'm now loyal to Apple products
Love it!! The only things is suri sometimes has a hard time understanding what you say and its frustrating to use.
Faster response on applications on the phone. Thanks to the dua-core A5 chip. Almost similar to iPhone 4 but Siri breaks that similarity. Beside battery draining too quickly, it's a good phone and meet my daily needs.
I use my iPad extensively and used to use a MiFi for WiFi now I use the iPhone 4S as a hotspot, phone and camera and sync it with my iPad. Very happy with this phone
I've had the new iPhone 4s for about two months and enjoy the versatility and amount of features available. It's powerful and yet still easy to use. I recommended the iPhone 4s to all who are either on the cusp of upgrading from an older iPhone or changing from another brand of cell phone.
Overall all this is a great phone for all it can do. My only problem is the battery life. Even after the software update, the battery life still isn't that great. Otherwise the ease of use, quality, and functionality of the phone is great.
took me awhile to get used to it, still learning, like the phone, would like a instruction book or video on all features on the phone. learned some things. there is a lot to learn, would like to take advantage of all there is to know.
Full of expandable features. Very handy not bulky.
Great iPhone with an excellent camera. The Siri is just OK. Siri has difficulty recognizing spoken words easily. Maybe there is a tutorial to learn the tricks to it. Battery life is good once you turn off most of the location services and notifications that are not necessary all the time. Talk-time battery life is very good. The maps app when used like a GPS drains the battery fast.
Love the iphone. I upgraded from 3G and it is such an improvement.
I'm new to the iPhone but can tell you this.....THIS PHONE IS AMAZING! I use it all the time for everything. It has replaced my laptop for travel use. Buy this phone, you won't be disappointed.
Although the new iPhone 4S is faster and has more features than the old iPhone 4, I bought it primarily for the camera. The camera takes great pictures especially in low light. It's a great substitute for a point and shoot digital camera. I love Siri too.
Easy to use, very dependable, great battery life, quality construction. Apple makes great products and the 4S is no exception. Highly recommend this product.
I love my iPhone 4S. I look forward to learning how to use Siri and have made a smooth transition from my iPhone 3GS.
It worked fine for the first month. Now the Siri has stopped working.
Much more user friendly than previous models and faster.
Not my first iPhone but it is a great upgrade! I love this phone! The camera takes better pictures and video than my digital camera does! This phone definitely exceeded my expectations. Highly recommended.
I am a long time Apple/iPhone user, and I have to say that this is the best Apple product that I have ever purchased, hands down. The Siri assist feature is a wonderful addition to the iPhone, and I use it daily. I could go on and on about how much I love this device, it is well worth the money!
Although not an exterior change for many (to me it was bc i had a black iphone 4 and now i have the white 64gb 4S, lol), the interior of this thing is phenomenal. Siri is majestic (even though I still refuse to talk to anything that is not another human being) to have fun with and while you are driving is actually pretty useful.
Siri is awesome I'm really enjoying this new phone
Love my iPhone!! Learn a cool new trick everyday. Easy to use out of the box!
so far so good. not alot different then iphone4. i lijed the design and thetefore i decided to try vut with the dual core ut is noticably faster
Does anyone else have trouble sending text messages?
Great phone and better then the 4 as the call quality has greatly improved.
iPhone 4S is another example of Apple design. Great features (siri rocks) and easy to learn, easy to use.
I was upgrading from the 3GS and glad I did. Does so much more than expected.. SIRI rocks.
Excellent phone, love Siri, love the picture quality.
It is suppose to be 4G compatible, but I have yet to see a 4G register. The browser is SLOW. The Battery wears out very quickly. WI-FI reception is poor. The Contacts app is merged with the phone and it wants to dial whenever you are searching for a number. Overall slow response to commands. This is compared to my iPhone 3S. Flagging emails is a great addition. The reverse camera is really nice, but I prefer my old 3S phone.
I love this phone and it's cloud capabilities. Siri is by far the best voice recognition software I have ever used. When she makes a mistake, it is usually because my Bluetooth earpiece is low on battery.
I was going to wait to purchase a new iPhone when the 5 came out next year. I had to wait to buy an iPhone because I was under contract with Sprint & the first iPhone I got was the 3GS. When the 4 came out I waited for my upgrade & hoped the announcement would be for the 5 in October. When it was for the 4S, I decided to wait for the 5. Then my 3GS died & i was forced to buy the 4S. I am happy I did because I love it!! The new 8MP camera & HD video with the steady focus are wonderful, the new processor flies through applications & tasks, and I love the possibilities with iCloud. But the best part of it? Siri!!!! Siri & iOS5 are amazing!! I am using Siri like crazy right now because I just had shoulder surgery & can't use my right arm which is dominant! But using Siri I can text, email, post on Facebook & keep track of my crazy post-operative schedule of appointments & physical therapy!! I love this iPhone so much that it almost makes up for all the dropped calls!! (Almost, thanks AT&T!)
It's perfect, although the sim died within 6 days, but got a replacement from another dealer asap for free.
Bought the phone for my wife. She loves it. One thing to note, take at least 2GB plan. 100MB Plan from AT&T makes the phone pretty useless. Also, AT&T connection is pretty bad, keeps dropping.
What is not to love about the iPhone 4S? My son received this phone for his 17th birthday and absolutely loves it. The iCloud and Siri add so much to the iPhone 4S. Make sure you sign up for your free @me.com email address. Thank you Apple for the amazing technological advances. Definitely recommend the Otterbox Defender case if you want to really protect this phone.
This is my first Apple Product .. So i feeling good . its a nice product
Since I got the Iphone 3g, I have always loved the Apple products. Since it was time to upgrade, I decided to get the Iphone 5 but they launch the 4S instead which wasnt a problem at all. I love the phone for all the new features and having one of the best phones in the market.
Like my new 4S the only major issue I have is when I attempt to make a call looking up a contact it shows the call going through however there is no ring or sound on my end. I can call back through recent calls and it seems to work. I have not contacted apple about this yet.
great product to use. It is very easy to use. It is a little heavy but not a big deal. the lay out is awesome aswell
Great phone. I'm still trying to learn all the different features but so far i love it. This is my second "smartphone" and I love the ease of it. Only downside is how fast the battery seems to drain. Great choice of apps in iTunes Store.
I pre-ordered this item and was impressed by the customer service that I received. It felt like VIP treatment. I also enjoyed all the special offers and optional services that were offered to me. I recommend purchasing this type of product at Best Buy to all my friends, and all my future purchases of this product will be from Best Buy a long as the service remains as good.
I loved my Galaxy S, but everyone in my family had the iPhone and convinced me to get the 4s. Siri looked appealing and I didn't have a flash, so I thought I'd give it a shot. Ugh. I wish more than anything I were swyping right now! That's the hardest change. The calendar sucks (the lack of reminder on the top until you turn the notification off is detrimental for me!), iTunes requires a password EVERYTIME you download something (really? It's my phone people. How many people do you think are downloading apps to my phone? And if they're free, why must I enter my password?!) This magical cloud isn't working for me, and that was a big selling point as well. And ringtone apps? Lame! I have found much better stuff in the Android market. And it's next to impossible to click mid-sentence or mid-word to modify your web address or text. AWFUL! This girl is getting rid of this iPhone and getting a Galaxy S 2! I can't wait to swype again!!! And have a "back" button!
I had the iPhone 3g for three years. I was waiting for the next iPhone to come out so I could get the iPhone 4 for $99. When I heard about the great camera and video camera I sprung for the 4s and I'm so glad I did. It's super fast and takes great pictures. No need for an extra camera to carry around. I really didn't think I'd use Siri, but I use it ALL the time. It's very convenient and provides for a good laugh at parties! "Siri you crack me up!" The response, "I'll take that as a compliment." I use this phone constantly. I have apps for banking, social networking, games for my kids (and me!), cooking, ordering pizza, etc. It is soooo much more than a phone. My only issue with the 4s was poor reception in a case. I was constantly losing service. I held the phone next to my husband's 3Gs - his had four bars and mine said no service. After one week, I was hours from taking the phone back when someone thought the fake metallic case would be interferring with reception. We took it out of the case and thank goodness they were right!!! My great reception returned. It has just as good of reception as my old phone, maybe even better. I LOVE THIS PHONE!!
Amazing upgrade from the 3Gs. Worth every penny! The speed of the dual processor is amazing, the apps open quickly, the camera is incredible. :)
I love my iPhone 3Gs and I upgraded to the iPhone 4Gs. I love Siri it allows me to talk to my phone for quick responses! the phone feels better in my hands with the new design. The phone is also faster in processing and with the HD video people love my movies on Facebook!
I upgraded from the original iPhone 3g and lived with many issues while waiting for iPhone 5. Was disappointed in the 4s name, but that was the only disappointment. Apps load very quickly, the camera is very crisp and meets my needs, love that i can keep streaming music while checking e-mail or accessing other apps. Screen size is smaller than many new Androids, but the phone fits in my pocket.
Everything is faster on the 4S - sound quality and ability to make and receive calls is just as good as on the 4 - camera is better but I still prefer to use an actual camera for pictures I plan to take in advance. Siri is not perfect but an interesting addition to the device. With the improvement in speed and extra features comes a slightly higher rate of battery usage but I still get all day out of one recharge. This is more evolutionary than revolutionary but overall it is a great device.
Wow totally blown away with how streamlined apple products are! The first day I had it I fell in love with (shoot does this make me an apple fanboy)! This was an upgrade from an Htc inspire, when I got the inspire i did tons of research and found several sites reviewing the inspire vs the iPhone 4 and all said the inspire was better soooo i believed them. This was my first touch screen phone and I loved it except the battery died pretty quick and the thing was pretty glitchy. Switching to the iPhone 4s is indescribable... but i'll try. Setting up the phone and iCloud was super easy, really every thing about the phone is super easy so easy it almost makes it boring ha ha. What I mean by this is it's so intuitive that there is no need to play around or customize the phone to get it how I wanted it. With my inspire there was a thousand different things I could customize and do with it and to get it to do stuff I'd have to do a bit of looking around on the internet for "how to" guides. In this regard I can see how nerdy guys love android phones and hate iPhones. Me though it's been a relief to not waste time trying to hack my phone to get it just right when apple's already done that for you! Don't get me wrong it is kind of fun to try to solve problems but I'm not really into doing that so much with phones - I kind of get my fix for this by playing around with the thousands of apps - very addicting and yes can be as much of a time waster as hacking an android phone. One thing I did have to do a little bit of research on the internet in setting up my iPhone 4s was getting gmail to work correctly through exchange, but like i said it's kind of fun solving these kind of problems but now I'm stuck with my "boring" iPhone that works perfectly. What's next...the display is awesome better than anything i've seen. love how smart the auto brightness is, something you might take for grantite unless you've had an android phone to compare it to. The touch keyboard is very good and intuitive, i hardly ever miss type things - for some reason i was always miss typing on the inspire. I do miss the big screen but i don't miss the size of the inspire. I go running and biking with my 4s and it's size is perfect I wouldn't want it any bigger or smaller. The size feels just right in your hand. It would be interesting to see how much research apple puts into something as simple as the actual size of their phones. WIth my inspire when i look at it now it seems kind of goofy and just like the developers where just thinking "how big can we actually get this thing?" like a white trash red neck figuring out how big of tires he can put on his truck. Ok next - the call quality, it works perfect, no complaints. The processor behind the phone is excellent. It's hard to judge the processor other than the phone and apps work perfectly and there are never any delays or lagging. The only thing i can really see where the better processor actually matters in comparing it to my friends iPhone 4 is in the camera. The camera does work much faster and you can tell there is some real power and speed behind how fast the phone stores the pictures you just took. The in-between time for taking pictures is as good as any point and shoot camera. With the camera - pictures are awesome! supper clear, I was worried that the picture size would be a problem with storage on the phone but....we have iCloud! I hardly ever attach my iPhone to my mac. I have it set to automatically upload all the pictures to iCloud so I can go through when ever I want and delete the pictures on my iPhone and they are on my mac in iPhoto under a folder titled "october photo stream". I'm assuming that in november it will make a new folder. Because iCloud is only free for i think 2 gb I will eventually have to physically save this folder to my computer. Might be important to note for some people that the only way to delete pictures from photo stream/icloud is when viewing them on the computer. You have access to all the pictures you previously took took from your camera in your photo stream album but you can't delete them from the iPhone. Next, the battery life is terrific and a not even something you have to think about(with my inspire i was constantly worrying about this and had to bring a charger everywhere!) I don't put my iphone back on the charger until i'm laying in bed and after I've watched an episode of the office on netflix. I guess the last thing to talk about is Siri. She's great! At first I thought it was a bit of a novelty and just a funny thing to show off to friends but it has become a very usable and important thing to me. First though I have to note that the iPhone headphones are garbage to me - they hurt my ears just sitting there for even a minute. To make Siri really usable though you need the inline controller that the iPhone headphones have so I bought the Klipsch is4 headphones (they are awesome you can see my review through best buy). I bike and run a lot and it's very useful to do things while biking or running without taking the phone out of pocket. By pressing the button on the inline controller I'm able to make a call to anyone, text, hear new text, respond to text, play fast forward skip, rewind music and even make a custom genius playlist, make notes, memos, make appointments, reminders - all while the phone is stowed safely away. It's still fun to use Siri for entertainment. My wife is always amused when I have conversations with Siri especially when I say to Siri, "Siri remind me to tell my wife that I love her in 30 minutes". In conclusion great phone/video camera/camera/assistant/music player/video player/personal video game system/gps navigator....the list could go on. The only things I can see apple improving on for the next iPhone would be for a slimmer phone (I think a phone as thin as the iPod touch would be perfect) and maybe a screen that goes goes closer to it's edges without your fingers holding the phone interfere, and of course we have to eventually get the technology to project holograms of princess leia...
For who didn't purchase an iPhone4...It is very good...And somebody calls it IPhone 4 Steve...
The phone was better than I thought, I just love the screen and camera.
I've upgraded from the 3Gs to the 4s and am amazed at the difference in the speed, the quality of the screen, and the better reception I'm getting. Before, I'd have little to no signal at work. Now I have at least 3 bars. I've not dropped one call, yet. The clarity of the screen even with a screen protector on it is awesome. Finally, the speed overall, from the apps, to the internet, to siri(the personal assistant) I'd definitely recommend this phone!
Only had the new 4s for a week and had to return it,because nobody could hear me.I had to put phone on speaker to talk..
This phone is probably my favorite piece of tech that I own. I do everything on it. It has virtually replaced my computer in almost every way and (sad to say), in a lot of ways, it is faster than my computer ever was. With ios 5, they have made the whole iPhone experience even better. Notification center does a great job of keeping everything in order and easy to access. The camera is unbelievable. My reception with AT&T shot up like crazy due to the intelligent antenna switching technology they put in the 4S and I had the iPhone 3GS before this. The changes made to this phone make it the best smartphone I've ever had and probably the best on the market. And Siri is... Well, you definitely have to try it to believe it. If you're thinking about this phone, get it. You won't be disappointed.
Looking for an upgrade from Iphone 4 to Iphone 4S ... then hold on and wait for Iphone 5 .. as this 4S is almost like 4 with new feature like 8MP camera, Siri (voice enabled web/phone search) and might be few others which i m still exporing .... I got this on upgrade from Iphone 3 ... so pretty cool for me .. with dual camera for facetalk ... the look is slik. Best Buy is taking pre-orders but they dont have white Iphones ... so be ready to wait if you want White from Best Buy Njoy your iphone!!!!
Great new phone!! I have had the 3G since it came out so this was a major upgrade for me!! I love everything about this phone!! Camera is awesome! Speed is super fast! And Siri!! LUV IT!! It even has a sense of humor!! As for the dropping of calls-- This one does so much better- My old 3G did not work in the office building where we are, but this one has at leaset two bars all the time-- Has yet to drop a call, although I have only had it a little over 24 hours, but so far so good!! I do wish it had a bigger screen though, but that is it's only downfall in my opinion--
One of the most best phones out there I LOVE IT !!!!!!!
I haven't traveled much since getting my iPhone but within my home area the reception and signal strength has been every bit as good as Verizon or T-Mobile. It's even a little better than T-Mobile within my home. I like that when I purchase an app or music, take a photo, make a note, send/receive email, etc it effortlessly gets synced to my iPad and Mac. I find myself needing to recharge every 1-2 days so I'd love to see better battery life, but that does improve when I remember to turn on WiFi when not in use. Apple needs to restore the ability to access those functions so that app developers can create the one-touch access to turn them on or off. I was unsure just how much data I would need so I opted for the 5GB plan. In casual use over three weeks I've only used 150MB so I think it might be overkill. One cautionary note: If you have a corporate savings plan like I do, know the details prior to signing up. When I got my phone the rep was unfamiliar with my savings plan. He was not able to add it to the account at the time of purchase. He said all I would need to do is call AT&T myself and it would be added to the account. This was not true, I had to register for it online and couldn't do so until 3 days later. That three day delay cost me an extra $12.00 in missed discounts.
The phone allows you to have a phone, camera, mp3 player, internet, and many forms of entertainment at your fingertips.
The iphone is the only smart phone that syncs with all four of M/S Outlook's functions: Contacts, Calendar, Tasks, and Notes
Perfect phone. Easy to use, and fun. Takes great pics and easy to text. Siri makes it fun too.
Very satisfied with this purchase & iphone lives up to my expectation.
Of course the glass is way too vulnerable and I broke mine before two weeks were up, but that's why I bought the protection plan.
I upgraded from the iPhone 3GS. The 4S has some better things than the 3GS. Overall great phone, Siri helps out a lot.
Overall a great phone. I bought it as a replacement for a 3GS where my screen was giving me issues. Siri is not as easy to use as they show on the TV. Hopefully the next ios upgrade will help with this. Also bought a LifeProof Case, as we've had some issues with our phones getting wet. Great case for the 4S. Battery life is much improved. I can now leave loacation services on all the time, whereas with my 3GS, I always had to leave it off until I needed it.
This phone tops out my 3gs the siri feature is awesome, resoulution is awesome overall good phone no complaints
i haven't had any problems so far. i like Siri, no problems.
This is my second iPhone! I wouldn't. Want to live without it now.
Simple and easy to use to use to navigate. Bought for my child to use at college.
I love my 4S. Siri gets a little confused at times. Its user friendly.
Overall, a great mobile device. I had an 8GB iPhone from sprint before and when I filled it up and needed to upgrade I decided to change to AT&T b/c sprint's service was terrible; I could never talk on their service with out the call being disconnected multiple times. Only real complaint about iPhone is the slow shutter speed on the camera...takes great pics of slow moving or still objects, but not so great keeping up with small children.
I switched over from a Droid & I was worried I'd be lost- but it was easy to figure everything out. I love it! & I love iCloud!!! Keeps my family nice & organized since my husband has an iPhone also!
Love it! I would definitely recommend it to others :)
i am really enjoying getting to know my personal assistant
The phone and apps on it are excellent. Great product. But when it comes to accessories, it is a pain as you cannot buy anything other than apple products (which are very overpriced). Big draw back!
Love my new iPhone 4s. Had the 3G for a long timeand the 4s is better in every way. Decided against waiting for the iPhone 5 mostly because I didn't want to wait 2 months for accessories.
I was resistant to switching from a competitor but the continuos lack of the apps I needed forced the issue and now I am very happy I switched. The only regret I have now is I didn't wait for the 5.
You can't hold onto it as well as the bumper types, and it's much slimmer. Took a getting used to, but really luv it!
I got this case the day I got my iphone (sometime in April) and i LOVED it! I got so many compliments and it was so slim! However it doesn't feel very sturdy. I never dropped the phone but I feel like if I did the phone would have broke. So not the best pretection. Also the glitter is a sticker so I was always picking at it. Finally one day in about June I was taking the case off and the peice above the camera broke. Very cheap. Don't recommend it if you would use it everyday.
I really like the otter box protectors. I wish they would improve the screen protector that comes with it to a better one.
I havent been swimming with it, but I know someone who did and her iphone still worked.
I love my otter box. It gives me great protection for my iphone.
Great to have a color other than black. Sturdy case. The touch screen doesnt always work when you want. You have to apply a little more pressure than the Zagg invisishield.
I paid a lot of money for this case. I've had it for a little over a month and the screen protector unglued. Also, the outer plastic cover ripped so soon. I was dissapointed when I couldn't even get an exchange because it was over 30days. Come on, you pay $50.00 for a case and you cannot exchange it for the same one because this one ripped and was no good?! How could I have not been dissapointed. If the case wasn't defective, it looks like it would be great protection for my phone, but since it was, I hate to give it a bad review but with reason.
The otterbox for the 3Gs I had previously was great! Durable and had no problems even though I was rough with my phone at work. The otterbox for the 4 has proved to be less durable even though I take much better care of my phone. The outer shell is poorly designed. The edges are thin and have come apart. The plastic inner case has broken. This new case does not live up to the toughness of the 3Gs case I owned.
The cover could be a lot better. Maybe it is not make for the I phone 4S and just needs to be cleaned up on the fit and holding capacity
This case is really worth about $5. Love the color and the see through back (so you can see the Apple logo) but it is rough around the seams and it has a very thin piece near the volume buttons. If something catches it, it will surely tear off.
The cover fits very well and allows for all of the connection holes to align. I can use my phone to play music in my car without having to remove the cover to get to the jack input.
I really love this case, it's a soft gel and I have dropped my new phone several times already and it did a good job protecting it. It's a little expensive though.
is just what I needed . nice color . very clingy so I don't drop it , lol
It's very sturdy for sure, but the white portion of the product gets dirty very fast
I've dropped my phone with this on and it didn't allow any damage to the phone. Worth the cost!
It has been a great protective device and the colors are great. But the white rubber stains easily and can't be cleaned or I haven't found anything that cleans it yet.
This is a good case that is not too bulky. The only complaint is the white rubber part of the case has gotten dirty and I've only had it a couple of weeks.
Had been avoiding the investment but it was on sale and I had reward $ so ... Very happy with it. Easy on and off, screen protector easier than some to put on. I got the white/purple. White cleans easy (with phone out) in dish detergent. I then let it dry overnight. Works better than anything I have tried and this is my third iPhone since they came out. Will get it again when I give in to the iPhone 5 this Spring. Down side is I have to undress it to put in some docking set ups that play my music.
This case fits over my invisible shield by Zagg and does not wrinkle it up. It feels like it will protect my phone well. It does slide on smooth surfaces and the white part is dingy after minimal use but I still feel good about the case and it's protection of my device.
Protecting your iPhone purchase with an Otterbox is the right choice. The phone works flawlessly while giving you the confidence that your device is protected. Both my 16 yr old and I have the Otterbox and are extremely pleased with them.
The OtterBox is a product of exceptional quality and provides good protection for the iPhone. However the OtterBox make the phone more bulky and not easy to carry. For that reason, the product does not work for my needs.
I had this case for less than one month. While taking my phone out of the case to put in my armband to run, the rubber molding broke. Two weeks ago the rubber came loose around the home button. I wouldn't spend the money on this case.
This is a great case for someone who doesn't want to worry about scratching, damaging, or dropping their phone. I use this phone case, and so do the guys I work with. If you're looking for a smaller case that is lightweight, you should definitely try something else. If you want something rugged that is meant for the working man, then you should definitely get this case.
It is a little pricey, but a replacement phone is even pricier.
I have this otterbox on my iphone and yet one drop still landed me with a crack iphone window. Not sure what the "real" function of this otterbox is. Pricing is high
I would highly recommend this iPhone case to anyone that is hard on their iPhones. It is a solid case and yet not too bulky like other cases I have seen. I mostly carry it in my pocket and do not use the belt clip. The rubber case will not allow the iPhone to slip out of your hands.
I anguished over many phone protectors before choosing this one, but the only time I dropped this phone was precisely because I thought it was firmly in the holster when it wasn't. The holster often sounds like the phone clicks in when it doesn't. I don't use holster part any more.
I've used this type case for over two years. The first one was red, and the silicone faded to pink after about a year, but phone was immaculate since the case was taking the abuse. The silicone finally tore as I was removing the case to do a cleaning. I bought another duplicate case which is in service now for 6 months. Phone is still in perfect shape. Working construction around all the dust etc requires cleaning the case more frequently but, I've dropped my phone from a 6' ladder and when I picked it up, all was well. If you're worried about the bulkiness, don't be. It's what you get used to. It seems people want a paper thin case to offer the same protection. Really ??? Not going to happen. The holster is extra durable and has also served well. Even though it's all plastic, the clip, spring, and detents, still work great. Hope this helps.
I love my new iPhone but what I don't like about it is that it's all meat and no fat, meaning that if I drop it, it's time for a new phone, period. Enter my OtterBox case. The case is great in that I've dropped my phone once or twice already and nothing's happened. The only problem I have with it is that the phone itself has a weaker battery life and I'm looking to get a case that has a battery built into it. Will probably do that eventually but for now this is just fine. Beyond that, yes, it adds some weight to the phone itself but I have no problem with that because I got the case with the phone and thus haven't known any different.
Best protection for your iPhone, my sons had them on their old phones and they were damage-free. Not inexpensive, but cheaper than a protection plan and just as effective.
I like this Otterbox. Used to use a slimline case until I dropped the phone and it wasn't protected at all. This is a great product but can be a little bit of a pain to take out and put back in the case to use on a dock.
Best used by children... rubber coating provides extra protection. However, it takes forever to get out of pocket because of rubber coating.
Best choice for a case to protect your iPhone. If you don't like bulkiness, I would try the commuter series. Overall, this is an excellent case I would recommend to anyone looking for the best protection.
Otterbox is one of the best manufacturers for protecting your electronics, in my opinion. I have used them for years and dropped, banged, thrown my electronics and Otterbox has protected my products without hesitation. I won't buy anything else if I have a choice.
Case is good protection for my phone. Easy to hold on to. The non slip grip feels good, gives secure feeling that I won't drop phone.
The top of the case tore open. I am a user that is hard on cell phones. It borke very soon after my purchase. The Apple store had warned me agaisnt this product, they were right!
i have a bunch in all different colors. protects my phone. child proof lol
When I got my first iPhone and it quit working within days of the purchase I decided to go with the maximum protection I could find and that was the OtterBox. It served me well for several years, but seemed to be a real dust and dirt magnet. When I got the iPhone 4s I decided to again get an OtterBox. While the original was good, I think the new one is better. Not quite as bulky but still provides very good protection. My only complaint was that it was a bit of challenge to figure out how to get it on the phone. (Why can't anyone write out instructions anymore, instead of just relying on pictures?)
Excellent protection for the phone. However, it can come off your belt, as has happened to me, allowing the phone to fall to a concrete floor. So far, the phone still works fine. It is a good looking cover, but the latch protrudes especially when the phone is removed, and rubs my elbow. Overall, excellent protection for the phone, which is my main concern.
I bought this to clip on my belt when walking. I have dropped it three times on the ground and no problems. I had it in my pocket when I got drenched at Splash Mountain at Disneyland and it kept it completely dry. It is worth every single penny I have paid and I recommend it to anyone who wants to protect their iPhone.
Amazing phone. Haven't found a single flaw yet. Totally integrated into my everyday life and so easy to use.
I wonder if this will ever make it. I'm writing a review on the iPhone as I do not feel this is the greatest product in the world. I have taken screenshots of my review to see if Bestbuy will take it down. Nonetheless... Here's why its great, and why its not. The phone has Siri. Kinda cool to play with, but then you realize that Apple is able to modify the database. This used to be driven based off of wolfram alpha's engine and now has a blend of information. Additionally, the phone drops calls when you hold it the wrong way. Kinda sucks. It gets very hot during face time calls and it feels as if it is too slippery. The phone has also become far too mainstream. It's like being a cattle in a pack. Oh what phone do you have? I have the 64GB Model... OOOO I only have the 32. Give me a break. The phones with apple are all the same. This is debatable if it is a good thing or not. The phone feels like it is well built and has a nice feel to it. It does a great job with texting, the input is very accurate. The apps are cool and all too. The phone is great because it feels expensive.
I use this phone for everything. Business and pleasure.
I love it! Have had it for about 2 months now, haven't had any problems with it. Best phone I've ever had!!!
I was hesitant to purchase the iphone, now I would have a hard time being without it. This phone is more than I thought it could be.
The is the BEST phone I have EVER had! I have been with every carrier and have had 2 Androids, 3 Blackberrys, 1 Nokia SmartPhone, and I must say that I will NEVER think about switching again. The iPhone is really created with the end-user in mind. The applications, the hardware, the accessories all make up an amazing experience, and reliable service. My battery life has been great, and the speed of the device is one of its best (of many) luxuries. I wasn't a believer at first, because everyone went GaGa of Apple's iPhone, but now I see why! I use it for everything, now!!! At the risk of sounding like a commercial, "It makes my life easier!!!" -REALLY!!!
Yep..and for good reason! I have been an iPhone user since the first incarnation. This phone is as successful as it is because it stays true to a near perfect formula. The Android OS has seen definite success and is great in its own right, but in regards to its relationship it has consistently been either A) Android OS releasing technology in an attempt to emulate and chase iOS's functionality or popularity OR B) Android OS comes out with an idea and iOS releases a similar product that is infinitely better and more stable. One such example is the 4s's Siri. While voice commands have been around for quite a while, anyone who says "Yeah, my phone has been doing that for a long time," doesn't truly understand Siri's capability. I needed detail any further, the commercials speak for themselves. No voice command app is able to do what Siri does. That's just one example why the iOS is superior in both class, stability and functionality. The 4s is an awesome step forward. I will say this, however, if you have a 4, don't waste your time with the 4s. Siri is awesome, but not worth the money or the use of your upgrade. Wait for the 5 which rumor has it is going to be more than an upgrade.
I've had a Droid for the past 2 years and it was time for my upgrade. I Waited for the new iPhone and was very glad that I did. It's an amazing phone where I can Store all my music, movies, games, and pictures on one handy device. The Hard drive size might be a little big for some but I wanted everything on one device. Otherwise I would have just went with the 16gb or the 32gb model. The call quality is great and the picture quality is flawless. Siri is also a very helpful Voice assistant that can quickly find information to any question. The best part is you don't have to speak in a specific tone or wording to get her to understand. The only downside right now is that the battery life is a little weak. This isn't because of the hardware but because of a problem with the software, so it will be fixed in the coming weeks. Overall an amazing phone and Apple kind of hooked me in with this one, so I probably wont buy anything over then an iPhone now.
Great phone with many useful amenities. Siri is a blast and quite useful as well. We've become an Apple family and soon will have all four of us using an iPhone.
LOVE IT!!! Can't seem to put it down. I have not really had any issues with the battery life.
After using two competing smart phones that had issues after about one year, I switched to the iPhone4s. The startup of this phone was simple and I was able to start using with a minimum of fuss and muss. Apps available seem to cover most of my needs for the first two week that I had the phone, including uploading my contacts I do wish that the documentation was better, I had some difficulty trying to use specific things that I had to search to find.
I've been an Android user for a few years until recently and other than learning the new OS and its ticks, the transition to iPhone has been painless! Screen display is bright and colorful, cameras take quality pics and vid. As long as I have decent signal strength my calls are very clear, both the speaker and mic. Great selection of free/paid apps available. Great selection of accessories from apple and 3rd party. Operating system is a breeze to navigate through once you familiarize yourself with it. At first I was hesitant to switch to iPhone but am very happy with the switch now. Love the fact that I'm not carrying a mini tablet around in my pocket!
Good protection at a very reasonable cost. Great corner protection. Reccomended if you drop your phone frequently.
Nice case but I had a hard time getting the screen protector into the case.
Like the case but had a terrible time getting the clear plastic screen protector on and then the case didn't want to go over it. So the edges of the clear protector don't look good.
Got this case shortly after I got my 4S (Oct 2011) and was very pleased with it initially. I looks nice, if not a bit bulky, and it is very good at protecting the iPhone if dropped or with everyday use. What is very disappointing with this case is the materials they use for the silicone protection age very poorly. After a few months it starts to stretch out and crack/tear and since the silicone has to fit into seams of the hard plastic shell, this becomes a problem for both appearance and protection, as things then slip past the openings that are formed by these issues. Also, the cradle/holster is VERY bulky (I know! I know! The iPhone itself is bulky in this case). I caught mine in the seatbelt of my car as I was getting into the passenger seat and snapped the belt-clip right off. Broken! Ruined!
bought this otterbox for my 13 year olds first iphone. its great protection.
When you buy an Otter box you will not be disappointed. I have purchased many in my home for EVERY phone. If you ever have to call customer service it is a real person. I broke a clip one time. Hassle free to replace. Worth every penny!!!
THE OTTER BOX ITSELF IS GREAT. THE BELT HOLDER BROKE IN LESS THAN A WEEK. I STILL HAVE TO RETURN IT BUT THE COVER ITSELF IS DEFINITELY A MUST BUY.
The product is similar to any Apple branded iPhone accessory without the Apple Tax...and it comes in Black. :-) Works just as good as the Apple charger would. However, the White Apple charger one has a slight advantage in that the cord's length is about 2 feet longer. This may not be that much of an advantage to most, but for me, and the USB ports on the bottom of my computer case, and the case sitting on the floor....my phone barely reaches my desk when it's plugged in. Other than that, it's Tip Top.
Sturdier than my original charger, also has good quality USB connection
the detachable usb cord makes it easy to charge different units
Works great at home for the ladies in the house who don't need a hard cover for the iPhone. I have a chip out of mine from having dropped it so frequently. The charger will not fit through the cover into the phone. Bought with phone and now use only as an emergency spare. Buying a USB car charger (Rockfish) as more practical for commuting. See the two below which I have used and like.
I got exactly what I expected and durable and reliable replacement for my iPhone charger. I didn't give it all 5's simply b/c if I could change anything, I would make the cord longer - otherwise it's perfect.
This product is definitely not worth the money. It rarely works--I have an old charger with a broken wire that works better than this one. I am surprised that Best Buy carries such an inferior product.
Very hard to be useful because the. Odd is too short
I've recently purchased this case and have gotten compliments on the appearance, but the case isn't worth the money. The material on the side of this case easily comes off. I've glued it several times with super glue but to no avail.
This is a great purchase for someone who is looking for the extra battery life during the day. This case does not add too much bulk to the device when on. I was torn between this case and the juice pack plus model, my only complaint is the the volume and power buttons are sunk into the case. This isn't too big of a deal but kind of gets annoying not having the button rise out of the case such as the juicepack plus. Otherwise this case is awsome and I highly reccommend this to anyone.
I recently bought this case for my iPhone 4, thinking it would be spectacular. Don't get me wrong, It was great for about 3 days. One day while i was playing video games, i picked up my phone (in the case) to charge it, only to find it was broken. I had not dropped the case once. I returned it to the store and got a new one. Guess what? It didn't work. It would not charge the case with multiple charger cables or adapters. I will be returning it again today, to get a new case for my iPhone. Overall, I am disappointed with the case.
This doubles the life of my battery. It adds quite a bit of weight to my phone, but the long life of my battery makes it worth it... I only need to charge my phone once a day now, compared to twice before!
I purchased this case while on vacation b/c I was constantly running down my iPhone 4S battery trying to upload pictures of our trip. I would last about a half day and then would have to leave it in the car to charge. First thing I noticed, the case doesn't fit as snug as it should. There was a gap at the top, b/c the top part of the case wouldn't snap down into place like it should have. The top part came off a few times while pulling the phone out of my pocket. the case isn't too bulky considering it is a charging device as well. I think they should have also provided a screen protector inside the box, but they don't. The charging feature is great. I had the battery below 20% and then flipped the switch to "ON" and then watched the battery power go all the way up to 96%. I made it the whole day without putting my phone in the car for awhile to charge. Great charging feature, needs work on a better case.
This saves me when i'm traveling. My phone always has a charge and i don't have to carry a charger in my pocket.
I have been 100% satisfied with this product. I have only had it for less than a week but it has HUGE advantages over the competitor. 1) Weight = Light so it won't make your iphone weigh as much as a bowling ball. 2) Feel = Amazing. I actually love having the case of for the design and how it feels to hold it in my hand. 3) You can charge and sync your phone while it is in the case there are other cases out there that you cant sadly. 4) The case comes up slightly higher than the screen so a drop won't risk your screen right off the bat.
Not only does this offer the security of extended battery life (which is quite nice) the black rubberized case looks and feels great. I do note-- we had to come in and exchange the red limited edition one, however because its finish was not as nice and wore poorly in the 2 weeks I owned it.
Its a great product. A little pricey but i think its overall worth it. Pretty much 2 batteries. 2 In one charging makes it a lot easier. I would recommend it for people that use there Iphone a lot, and or don't have access to a charger when needed.
This is my second Mophie battery. Oh no the first one is still fine and holding tight but I got a new Iphone 4S for my wife and decided to pick her up one as well. Just like my other review this item keeps going and going like the Energizer Bunny. Mophie has excellent customer service and this is the essential tool for the road warrior or power user. Pros: (for me) is the fact it eliminates the iPhone charge/sync cable and lets you use a micro usb. This is huge for me and means less cables I have to worry about. The extended battery and top notch customer support is just icing on the cake. Cons: The case is a little expensive and for such a protective case it should come with a screen cover. I think this could give the phone 360 degrees of protective coverage.
I loved this when I first got it because i didn't really have to charge my phone for almost two days depending on my usage. Yesterday, it broke and couldn't charge because the piece on the extended battery where you plug the wire into broke and couldn't be fixed and would charge the device. Glad I got it on sale for $40 2 months again , I would be really mad if i paid the regular price of $80
While in El Centro, CA my phone was constantly trying to find a signal and I couldn't make it through the day before I had to recharge my phone so I broke down and bought this charger. I must say I did not have to worry about my phone dying the rest of my time there or anywhere else for that matter. A little pricey but you will not be disappointed!
It does add some bulk/weight to the iPhone 4s, yet the benefit of significantly extended battery life outweighs this.
I love this thing. I always run my battery down on my iphone and carry around a charger with me everywhere. Now - I have the peace of mind knowing that I have a back up and don't have to worry.
Before I got the Mophie Juice pack for my I Phone I would run out of battery life frequently but not anymore! I love the Mophie!!!
This is a very cool and nice charger, my phone was at 30% battery I turned on the charger and it charged it fully! but I didn't see much use for it because I was never away from an outlet for more than a few hours so I returned it. But if you are one that is a strong user of your iPhone then this is a very good product to invest in.
Awesome gadget. I no longer worry about carrying my AC charger everywhere, just in case my iPhone battery runs low. Power on demand! Love it!
I got it to save my battery life and the phone connector beside being a case, very satisfied wih it
So my iPhone at home has terrible coverage. The phone is constantly searching for a signal which completely destroys my battery by midday. This case enables me to go the entire day without having to worry about charging. So nice! The only down side is it makes the phone a little heavy. I like the slim sleek look myself. This still has a little of that but is just heavier. I can also turn the case on and off for charging my phone. After using the case for a while you can pretty accurately predict how much charge u have left on your phone. I can just say the fact that I am able to actually use my phone all day and it is not sitting in my car charging makes any downside of this case irrelevant.
I liked it so well, I bought one for a friend. It is very light weight and is pleasing to hold.
I was looking for a battery case for my iPhone 4S and happened across this one while browsing the web. I read some reviews and decided to purchase one in my local BestBuy. The Good: The look of the case goes well with the iPhone 4S. Although it adds some bulk to the phone, it's still on par with most others I've used. It's extremely easy to insert the phone as well and it feels really secure with an exception of the front display (I'll go into in the Bad). The micro USB output works with any micro USB cable that I've had as well which makes it extremely convenient to find a cable to use when I do have to charge it. The battery meter located on the bottom makes it really easy to check the level of the Juice Pack at any time. The speaker holes really do an excellent job of redirecting the sound upward instead of straight out of the bottom of the iPhone. As far as extending the battery life of the phone... this is where the Juice Pack truly excels. I will charge up the juice pack overnight (starting around 1am actually)... I disconnect it around 8:30am and when I get home at night I'm usually still at 100% iPhone battery and 2 lights left (50%) on the Juice Pack battery meter. This is with receiving email all day... making a few phone calls.. surfing the web at lunch... texting... watching a couple of YouTube videos... my standard day. The best way I've found to use it to make the most out of the extended battery is to flip the charge switch on when the phone battery drops to about 95% and when the phone battery reaches 100%, then flip it back off. If you're looking for a great extended battery in a case, this is the best I've found. The Bad: The only issue I have with the Juice Pack as a protective case is that it doesn't feel like the front of the phone is as protected as it should be, which for me is not a big concern... but it could be a sticking point to others. The other issue I had with the Juice Pack is I had to return the first one I purchased the next day because it slipped off my coffee table while charging and it pulled the internal charging cable connector loose (It was rattling inside). I don't think the connector is as well constructed as the rest of the case, so you would need to be careful with it. Overall I would recommend. Good luck!
The Mophie Juicepak helps to provide excellent protection fro your phone when you accidentally drop it. It also provides great battery reserve for those who like to play games or run other apps on their phones, are away from their chargers or plain simply forget to charge their phone.
I bought this brand and model because it was the only one left on the store how ever now I see others are cheaper and have more mAh of battery capacity. I use it when I drive my motorcycle since the gps and Bluetooth for my helmet drains the iphone battery very quickly. This product is the best and only option for this particular use.
I purchased this product from Best Buy. It is an excellent product for busy commuters who are constantly recharging their iPhone 4. The Mophie Juice Pack AIr doubles your iPhone's battery life while on the road, and provides great protection for the OEM glass & aluminum body. I was hesitant to spend $80 on this product, but looking back, it was an excellent decision!
Not only is it a great Battery Pack it also doubles as a wonderful sturdy protectivive cover for the phone. It does add a slight bit of weight and length to the phone but for me it makes it easier to hold and use. The company is in the process of making a belt clip for it and should be available mid January. In the mean time I bought a point and shoot camera holder that attaches through your belt and that works just fine. Great product.
This is best decision I took after purchasing my IPhone 4S. It doubled teh battery life. I now charge my iPhone only twice or 3 times a week and that too with all features enabled. The Charger is absolutely amazing.
wow! I am glad that stopped by to read about this product. I went into bestbuy and purchased one after reading the reviews. this is the best accessory I could have purchased for my phone. the price is right when you consider it's dual function. I love that it's not bulky. I love that now I don't have to worry about losing battery power. I am going to google it to see if they have one for the iPad as well. lol since I got this, I have dropped the phone 2x and the hone is fine. if you get this I don't think you will disappointed. I have already mention this and shown it to a few friends.
I freaking love this thing. The battery on my iPhone has gradually degraded little by little to the point where I had to leave it on the charger at work to even make it thru the workday. I let it drop down to 15 or 20% then flip the switch and it rapidly charges me up quicker then when I just have it plugged into my regular charger. The case doesn't add much weight and actually make the phone easier to type emails on since it adds a little girth for my big hands. For anyone that travels a lot of just had poor battery life with their 4 or 4s it is the perfect solution.
I'm just going to say it like it is. It a battery case! Yes, it's going to add size and weight. I like the extra size and weight though because I have big hands plus the non-slip coating is great too compared to the slick glass on the IPhone 4 itself. I had one of these for my 3GS and loved it as I'm a really heavy user and this model didn't disappoint. It will give you about 60-70% extra battery and the case protects the IPhone really well. I dropped my iPhone many times on gravel and concrete, of course as you would imagine, the case takes a beating but my IPhone is fine.
The company purchased this product for a client. We received the item and at first it looked good. We tested the issues below on two different iPhone 4s both showed the same issue. When the iPhone 4 is in the sleeve everything was good till you put the sleeve in your pocket. The motion from walking around had the phone connect and disconnect from the sleeve which made the phones charging sound come on and on and on .... Even when you tried holding the phone in you your hand and moving the phone would make the charging start and stop. Also, we found that the unit could only charge the iPhone from a 20% iPhone battery charge to a 75% charge before the juice pack air was flat. The juice pack air is the smaller version but we would have thought that you would at least get a full charge. From the other reviews here it looks like the product should work and we might have received the Monday-built version and combining with the experience and the battery performance we give this product an Average rating.
I've gone through at least $150 worth of iPhone 4 cases and was disappointed in ALL of them, until now! Mophie promised a lot with this new Juice Pack Air, and they've certainly delivered! I was worried this battery case was going to add considerable bulk to sleek size of the iPhone 4, but I was pleasantly surprised at its compactness. Ease of use would allow a child to function and the LED's that depict charge percentage are very cool. The matte finish on the case makes sliding in and out of pockets a breeze! Only bad thing I may say about the case, if anything at all, is that I can't dock it with my iHome or other docks without removing it from the case. Not really a problem since it's the fastest and easiest to remove i've seen! AWESOME PRODUCT!!!
I do a lot of traveling - and it's great not to have to worry about your battery dying. It works extremely well with the iPhone 4.
I have not made a more satisfying purchase since I bought my phone. I am always on the go and this case has made my phone last all through my day which ends well into the night! My phone hasn't died on me since I bought it. It's also very stylish and actually enhances the look of the phone. I have a white one. I've also dropped it a few times with no damage to either my phone or the case. I bought my husband the juice pack plus which is a bigger battery. Now I'll always be able to reach him. Changed my life! Love it!
Not quite sure if the other reviewer got a bad unit, but this charger case is amazing. It's sleek and doesn't add much weight at all. Most of all it has already saved me twice this month. I left the house with out my charger and it was so nice to flip the switch and watch it quick charge. I highly recommend this piece for anyone that is a high user of their iPhone.
Fail in every way. Doubles the size and weight of the phone. Seems to cause phone battery to drain faster. And case battery is not good either. Iphone battery had 20%. Powered on the case and it charged it to 70% before it died. Waste of money and way to bulky.
Great idea to have a battery replacement inside a case with indicator leds showing the level of battery. I loved this stuff while it worked. The plastic case is extremely robust. Don't know if is good or bad, but felt like I had a big mobile phone of the 80's. The worst part of the story started when one day the USB connector started to came loose until broke! Of course I cannot use it any longer. and it's just a USB bracket that could cost a couple of dollars... All the good impression I had about this stuff was vanished in one second. Don't know if a warranty applies for this. Hope it does!
This product suffers from the same poor design as my old blackberry curve. While it is quite sturdy and does its job well, the weak link (chink in the armor) is the USB connection port. I bought 2 of these, one for me and one for my boss. Within 3 weeks mine was broken and his kicked the bucket a few days later. Same problem both times, the charging port came loose and ultimately would not work. Neither was dropped or mishandled. $90 for the charging cased and felled by a $1.95 charging port. I give it 1 star because 0 stars was not available.
Good looking and seems to be a grood protection, but the extended battery life is great and is the major reason for the purchase. I use my iphone for business and am on it all the time. Now I can use it the full day wihout having to charge it.
I LOVED my Mophie. It did make the phone quite a bit heavier but I was able to use my iPhone throughout the day and not worry at all about decreased battery life as I do without the Mophie. However the charging plug snapped inside and I could not connect to recharge the case again. I have returned all to mophie direct per the warranty (1 year) and will see if they honor the obvious frailty and equipment failure of the connector inside the case. It obviously is due to poor design as you can hear the connector rolling around inside if you shake the case.
I love this thing. I regularly use a iPhone music player that requires my phone to be out of the case. This case comes off really easy and its easy to replace as well. I get full charge on the phone from the Mophie which gives me about 6-7 hours more of battery life and it charges in about 2.5 hours. It comes with it's own USB charging cord that is different from the iPhone's 30 pin connector. The only downfall is there isn't a screen protector.
I bought a "juice pack" and to my surprise, after charging it more than 24 hrs with the phone in it, my phone was totally discharged. (It was full when started this). Repeated trials lead to same results. I bought a second one, thinking I got a lemon, but I saved the receipt this time. Same result, instead of a juice pack it was pack of sucking the juice from my phone. I tried charging it separately, it doesn't work any better. At last, I returned the gadget and I will never buy another one from mophie.
Very useful since my phone dies a lot because I am on my phone constantly playing games. The price is a little steep, but if you are an avid iPhone user, this product is great!
My wife got me this case for my bday, b/c I need to have a charged phone in case I have to make stocks trades while not at home. I wasn't a huge fan b/c the case is bulky, but having that extra charge was handy for the few months that it actually worked. The most critical piece to the case is the USB port and it broke loose and no longer accepts a charge. Could have a been a strong product that I would have used for years.
The iphone has an 8G camera which takes great pictures. This accessory is just something else to get lost and isn't worth the money. Buy another camera with a zoom on it before buying this. I took it back the 3rd day I had it.
this is a great product to get if you like to take pictures it helps take better pictures and extends you iphones abillitys.
This lens fits right over my IPhone 4 perfectly... I love the Fisheye mode for school event picture taking, and the macro lens for taking pictures of small things that I want to put on any of the merchant auction or ad sites. This is my new favorite Toy.
I'm so glad I came across this product. The Olloclip is the best fisheye and wide angle lens for the iPhone. It attaches easily and stays securely locked until you want it off. You can instantly notice the difference with the 180 degree fisheye, you can take a picture of the wall and see part of the ceiling in the shot. It looks amazing. The wide-angle is good too, definitely makes the iPhone more like a point-and-shoot. I haven't really found much use for the macro, other then taking microscope shots of my finger and small objects. You can pretty much put the lens right up on your subject and get a crystal clear image. The Olloclip may seem expensive compared other magnet-style iPhone lenses, but this one really is superior. You want a lens that is going to stay put and easily removable, not dealing with sticky adhesive rings on your smartphone and crossing your fingers that you don't shake the phone enough to knock the lens off. I'd recommend this Olloclip 3-in-1 lens to anyone with an iPhone thats interested in photography and video. Its great for sports, where you can get close to the action yet still capture everything in the shot. I personally use mine to film skateboarding, and for that it works awesome. The lens bag also doubles as a microfiber cloth, which is pretty clever. You can't use it with a case, but thats easily remedied. Just take off the case when you wanna shot some great photos/videos, then put it back on.
-Three lenses. The fisheye is the most useful. -Easy to use. It just slips on over the i-phone camera. However, cannot be used with an i-phone case. The case needs to removed.
It is an awesome lens. The it is exactly what you think your buying. The quality is excellent. I didn't give it 5 stars because it covers up the flash. I don't really need the flash too often but I think they could of made it without covering the flash. The pictures that I have taken with it are in no way diminished by the lens. Buy it!
I took this to New York and was great for taking awesome shots of New York Skyscrapers. Get real (meaning not faked with an app) Fisheye and Wide-Angle shots. You'll be looking for new things to take pictures of, trust me.
Recommend! We can see everything: heart, speed, cadence, calories, gps, etc... But It's a little big case for the bike...
I can't really give this a valid review, because the package I got (which appeared to have been opened before, although I was assured it was not) was missing a couple of parts. From what little I could see, though, the mounting seems fussy. No opinion on how well it works because I didn't get that far.
I can't begin to tell you how great a product this is. I have both the bike kit accessory and simply the little adaptor by itself that I simply attach when I go running or hiking. It's also compatible with Gamin accessories as well. (bike Cadence and Speed/ Heart rate monitors) Ant+ power meters and such as well. It brings a whole new level to fitness and training allowing me to use to track all kinds of information and sharing or challenging other people with online. I use the MapMyFitness App with it and it tracks and updates me with a weekly recap on my progress. Come check it out... Once you get it and start using it, your never train or keep track with anything else. New feature through the MapMyFitness is real-time tracking on it, if your racing and friends have come to support you, they know where you are at on the course at all times. Or if your just out training your Wife/Husband knows where your at as well.
This is a very decent pouch for the iPhone 4 / 4S. It looks like designed for girls/women with a credit card pocket built in. One credit card will fit tight in the pocket. Putting more than one credit card may result tear and wear to the pouch. It is highly recommended to use hands-free/Bluetooth headset while using this pouch. It is not practical to attend calls every now and then by taking out the handset out of the pouch. Pretty looking nice slim fit. The product image shown here is not the right one. There is no strap at the opening as shown in the image. Please refer to my uploaded image for a clear look at the pouch. Over all nice looking, above average quality product. Using it for less than a week, so cannot predict the durability and stability in the fit. Thought to review little early because I wanted to add the real images so my fellow "best buyers" will get a clear idea rather than getting disappointed to find out there is no strap if that was a buying point for you. I found the package design most interesting and very useful to in-store buyers. Package can be opened and feel the finish and the fit before you buy this product. It is very convenient feature. Best of all, it seems to be a Best Buy exclusive item :)
I just purchased this at the store. It seems like a nice case and reasonably well made, with a small amount of padding, for the price. But I want to let you know that the picture is decieving. There is NOT a strap across the top to keep the phone from sliding out. This might not be an issue, but time will tell if the case stretches any. If you have any kind of case (like the ones that offer some protection of the sides and back), the phone wont fit.
I always loved the leather case that came with my Blackberry and was disappointed I couldn't find anything similar when I changed to an Android phone. I was SO happy to see that they had this available for my iPhone. I don't like cases that are on them when using the phones - I prefer something like this that protects it when not in use.
I really am glad I have this case. My phone has gotten wet a few times, and I don't have any problems with it because I have my lifeproof case on. I just wish it came in different colors for girls to choose from.
I bought this product because I have a pool and I drop my phone all the time. Since this case was waterproof and shockproof I thought it was perfect for me. BUT I was wrong! I tested the case just like the box said and there were no holes and no leaks. I put my phone in the case and had it in there for 2 months. Also it was in the pool about 6-7 times and never leaked. I dropped it a bunch of times and that must have made it crack open. I was in the pool the other day and my phone started to leak! I took my phone out but it was too late! My phone had water damage. I noticed a small little crack in the bottom of the case that made the water come though. So yes the case may be waterproof but only if you DO NOT drop your phone. Which the box says the case protect from dropping. This product is a BIG waste of money! I had to buy a new phone that cost me 300 dollars and I couldn't return the case because it was after 30 days so I lost that money too.
Good product for being waterproof. I dropped my phone in the pool and not a drop of water got inside. Sometimes when I charge the phone I have problems getting the plug in and out of my phone correctly and I cannot use the silent button on the side of the phone at all. I have to turn the volume down all the way, that's kind of a pain. All in all I would recommend this phone....although I think the price is too high for this product I would still recommend it.
Does a great job of protecting the phone but people complain they cannot hear me well and I also cannot hear others well.
Was looking for a camera for family events that produced quality pictures, but not priced like a professional camera. We have an easy to use camera that produces quality images with lots of capability for a great price.
might be pricey but it is very much worth the price
I bought this cover for my granddaughter's iPhone. She has gone thru 4 phones in a year and a half do to water damage. This cover is made for durability and will save her phone from any kind of damage.
If you're seriously around water all the time - on a boat, by the pool, etc - this is for you, but for a price. I thought it was a bit expensive, but nice that it's water-proof. Plugging-in things like headphones or your charging chord are pretty difficult if not sometimes impossible.
I purchased the Lifeproof case for a new iPhone 4. iPhone4 was not used without the case. Less than 2 months after purchase, the phone was dropped from a distance of less than 3 feet. The iPhone screen shattered. I contacted Lifeproof, who were not very nice, and did not even offer any apologies or anything. I called Best Buy customer service, which was fantastic and helped me. I am still stuck with the broken iphone, and will likely have to replace the screen myself. I will never purchase another lifeproof case and do not recommend this case for protection against drops. I had several iphones before this, all that were protected with Otterboxes... had no problems with any of them... I will be purchasing one of those once I fix my screen.
While this case claims to be waterproof, I was not comfortable testing it, with my phone in it, in water. In order to charge the phone, the case either has to come off, which isn't easy, or you have to purchase a separate charger that is expensive. The idea is definitely enticing, but I wouldn't drop it in a pool of water to test it's claim.
Took it back. Item wasn't cost effective ...way too expensive. Main reason for return was the case was bulky, big, and wouldn't fit in the pocket of my purse or jeans. Too big and hard to text with.
I love this case. It is a little pricey, but worth it. I feel confident letting my grandchildren play games on my iPhone, because I know that this case will keep it totally protected from drools, spills, and accidental drops. To be honest that is the main reason I purchased it. What's not so great is my Verizon car charger won't fit with the case on, only my apple home charger fits, so I have to always make sure I have my phone fully charged before I go anywhere. Another thing great about this case is that nothing is affected by it, the keyboard, sound, etc. For the protection you get from this case, it also nice and sleek.
Really like the case. Don't like the headphone adapter or the need to have to use an Apple charger to connect.
Nothing seemed better for protecting my wife's phone but when she talked to e, it sounded as if she was using a voice changer or had turned into Darth Vader. Returned this & went to OtterBox.
Great case I love it! I use it all the time fishing, hunting, on the boat and on the beach. It keeps the inside dry while I can still take pictures in the rain or standing in the surf. Works great only downside is that it does not float!!
Bought this case for my 10 year old daughter as she uses this on my I-4 that she uses as her's (was our old home phone). The case worked well however after a month she noticed the yellow stopper on the bottom was missing and I called Lifeproof they are sending a replacement after sending a photo and proof of purchase. I will be sending the cover back. So far I have replaced my personal case (which leaked some humidity after a few weeks) directly by Best Buy (under 30 days of purchase) and this. I would still buy it again. Do follow the instruction and water test the case before use-there could be a factory defect! Wish they would come out with a lanyard and float to assure you don't drop it in the bottom of the sea!
Easy to install & excellent protection for iphone. Difficult to remove 3rd party car charger will not fit into connector opening
I absolutely LOVE this case! I ordered it because I wanted something waterproof for a 20th anniversary cruise. It works perfectly. So well in fact, that my 18 year old son got one too. It's gorgeous, the display is crisp and clean, everything is still easy to use and sounds fine so don't listen to the complainers. Everyone asks me what kind of case it is and where I got it. You should see the people's faces when you go underwater with your iPhone :) GO get this case!
I was so happy to find a case that would adequately protect my new IPhone. When you make a purchase of a costly item, such as this mobile phone, it's good to know that it is protected from water, sand, dirt, spills, etc. I chose the purple color, which makes it easy to find as it stands out a bit more than the typical black or white. I would definitely recommend the LifeProof Case for the Apple IPhone 4S.
The cover broke over the connection port within the first 90 days. Not what I would have expected.
This is the perfect case for anyone, whether your outdoors, indoors, this case protects your phone and is still thin enough to fit into ur pocket. It covers the entire phone and doesn't interfere with typing or touch sensitivity..... Totally love it!!! Just can't wait for the arm band!!!
I don't really like the look or the feel of it once you get it on your phone. It may be waterproof but I was reluctant to try and figure it out.
this is a great case, keeps phone safe from spills and drops. I dropped my phone the other day and it was fine. I'm sure with out this case I would have to get another phone. Also good for those spills that happened. Spilled coffee and just wiped the case clean. Nice bit of protection and I got it in my favorite color..
While my wife was using her phone while in the kitchen, she droped this case with her phone into the skink full of soap and water, after she screamed that she droped it she grabbed it out. We opened the case and the phone was safe and dry as a bone. thinks lifeproof!
I am not sure if anyone else has had this problem, but when my wife put her iPhone 4s into this case everyone she talk to could hear an echo, usually a bad echo. When she took her phone out, crystal clear talking. I would not recommend this case to anyone.
I decided to go from one of those incase cases to lifeproof after nearly breaking my phone to pieces. I have geek squad protection on my phone but I have a high tendency to drop my phone quite a bit so i got it and its fallen in the pool and everything and my phone is still 100% functional. It's a bit of a pain to use your headphones or to turn up the volume but it's a small price to pay for a near indestructible case.
These cases are awesome! I recently got a purple one after having a black one for almost a year (wanted a color change). You won't find a better case than a LifeProof case. I've had tons of different iPhone cases over the years and this one kills them all. You can beat the heck out of these things and they will keep your phone protected no matter what you throw at it. The best part is when you're out with some friends and you drop your phone into a pitcher of beer and watch their faces... PRICELESS!
I have black, white and purple cases from lifeproof. These cases are simply amazing. Sleek, slim, survives drops and is waterproof. Won't stick to your pocket and all phone functions are fully functional with the case on. Won't ever use any other case.
This is a great case it keeps your phone safe while looking great ..purple is super nice and really pops with the black trim ..the case is sleek tough waterproof and cool ! You will never use another case and the company is great ! I have one in every color and everyone I know with an iPhone now has one!
Read the fine print...the company does NOT stand behind product! Phone was fine in the cheap cases...invest in the $80 case and phone shatters. Waste of $$...DON'T BOTHER!
I bought my lifeproof case took it a lot of places then i started to notice scratches then a week later I gave my nephew it to play with in the bathtub and then I saw water in the inside of the case so Im going to take it back and get another one. If I can or maybe contact lifeproof cause it's a amazing case. Too bad it's broke
This thin is GREAT! Im a teacher and a full time mom! All of my kids swim and its great that i dont have to worry about my phone!
I bought this case because my 6 year old plays on my phone a lot and drops it a lot. My only problem with it is that plugging anything in to it (ear buds, charger) is difficult. You have to have an adaptor for the ear buds and some after-market chargers won't fit in the small opening for the charger. I might have reconsidered buying this case if I had known those two things, but it does protect your phone....my daughter has already put it to the test!
Great case and so far no regrets with the price. Feels safe with it around water and seems to still take clear pictures.
While I really do love the protection this cover provides I do wish it was smaller. It is not as bulky as the Otter but for a female it doesn't fit well in a front pocket. Other than that it was worth the purchase price for protecting your phone.
A splendid case if you are prone to dropping in water, dropping on concrete, use it in dust or sand or generally do not take care of your phone. However, if you are a normal user and enjoy the iPhone's great screen, watch videos, listen to music, view pics etc, this case is not for you.
We bought this case because our 9 month old loves to play with our iPhones. So far it has passed the high chair drop and the chew tests.
Well, the good news is my phone cannot, get wet! Other than that I wish that I wish It was easier to press the buttons. The camera always gets smudges on the lens and the case always has fingerprints on it. I am constant ly having to clean my screen. For the price I would think it would resist smudges more and be easier to type a number
I love the case and didn't believe what it can do until I did the water test. My phone fell a few times but nothing happen to it yet. Still waiting for my phone to fall in water but not just going to but it in water. Did the water test without phone in side.
Great case for protection, but hard to attach accessories such as ear phones and auxillary cables. Unless the bottom latch is open, the speakers are very muffled.
So after having suerged my iPhone 4 in the bathtub TWICE (stupid I know), I decided to get the case for my new phone. I had a regular case and somehow the phone still managed to function with only minor problems. I love the fact that the life proof is waterproof, however it is so inconvenient to use. I always use my headphones to talk when I'm driving or the aux cable to listen to music. So the little screw in part is never inside the case. I've lost it once already. And if I want to play music in my dock of my home theater, the case has to come completely off. Charging is also a hassle, as is texting. So I've smartened up and now I just don't bring the phone with me in the bathroom. And I'm not a fisherman so it's not like I'm around lots of water. And speaker quality is def decreased. I would have gotten a refund but I lost my receipt. So I'm stuck with a case I don't use. I guess for some it's perfect but there are too many cons versus pros for my use.
This is a great case and really protects my phone, I had an otter box but it was bulky
Had case for 2 months. My 12 month old was in his stroller in our bathroom when he got the phone and dropped it on the tile floor from a height of about 15". Shattered the glass. I'm furious!
This case provides good protection for my 16 year-old's phone. Has protected against several drops during the first few days.
Only had this case for a month, the corners cracked off, and the logo scratches off, and wears off too easily. Buy a more rugged case, this is of a cheaper quality but looks nice.
Another good ifrogz case. I got the pink and black one for my wife. She's not a "pink" kind of girl, but shee is more than happy with it.
This is a good sturdy cover. Needed a temp case for my phone. This is great.
The product is great when you drop your phone it is well protected!
I really like the feel and purpose of the cover....however within 2 weeks the finish color (pink and black) began to crack and chip off around the edges that surround the face of the phone. I don't ever remove the cover, which may stretch that edge and it still did this???????? Maybe a solid black one would not do this?
Allow for non-slip handling. Show's off the iPhone while providing non-slip on almost any surface. It does not last forever.
Love it!!! But will like it in clear or more options in colors
I do love this case, especially in the bright green that pops bright off of my black iPhone 4S. I think it has great style. The one problem is that it doesn't protect the phone. It has a lip so it won't touch a surface, but it still is open so when you are texting you are putting your fingernails on the back and could end up scratching it. I think it is nice, but to keep it in a pocket while moving could be risky, with a glass phone. If you get this case I recommend a screen cover on the front and the back. Just in case. I gave it five stars because it is worth them. It is really opinion to think it is unsafe. It depends on you.
Apple makes great products! I recommend them to everyone!
I'm very happy with this phone. One of the reasons I switched back to the iPhone was iTunes. Although Android had an decent music interface, apples music interface is far superior. If your considering a new phone that's easy to use this phone meets that need.
I have had every generation iPhone since the 2nd generation, the iPhone 3G. This is by far the best phone Apple has made. Their software getter better and better with each update. I use Siri all the time. It's a very helpful and accurate feature. I don't think there is a better phone on the market. People can say, "Well, it doesn't do this...." That's okay with me becuse it does so much more and it works. I don't have to take my battery out and reset my phone. Excellent phone.
This is another great iPhone. The data speeds are much faster than the iPhone 4. It looks great and works well. Just what you expect from an iPhone.
Love my iPhone. Tried many others had to come back. iPhone is just simply the best hands down. The battery you have to do a few full cycles down to get it to not die on you in the middle of the day. The first week is the toughest but after a few full power down cycles battery is good. (hint: get rid of location services on unnecessary apps/remb to turn off bluetooth once you disc your headset) I use my phone everyday all day and never have a problem. My only issue is the white hazing of the some random photos. BB guy said it is a 4s flash issue. We will see... other than that won't leave anywhere without it !
Having had two iPhones, an iMac and an iPad2, I must have had a mental break because I decided to try Android. Five months later I was so disillusioned I paid full price for the 4S. I trust my apps are vetted by Appple, as android market only sells a license to sell apps. Controls are once again familiar, almost intuitive after years of practice. There is no rational reason to change platforms, stay with Apple IOS
I have enjoyed using this phone and it is my first Apple product and since I have purchased an IPad.
Love my iphone After breakin my old iphone 4 i had to definately get te 4s and its just as Great! Siri is so useful too Cant be without it now
I don't really have anything bad to say about my new phone. I have yet to utilize it's full potential. The battery is the only downside along with if you are using 4G sometimes the connection is slow depending on your carrier. I went from a blackberry that still had a track ball to this and I am very pleased so far.
The main reason why I upgraded to the 4S from the 3GS was for memory. However I am very pleased with the additional functions that the 4S gives me, including Siri. While it has proven very useful, it still lacks a few functions. For starters, I can get the quickest route to a destination, but only from my current location. Also, sometimes it misunderstands my voice. The only other complaint I have is with the stainless steel on the phone. If I'm holding it sideways, it feels uncomfortable after a while. Getting a bumper or case would help. The 4S is pretty easy to use, and I love that it can also function like an iPod touch.
Above & beyond all the rest of all smart phones .It's the apps and operating system .
This is my first iPhone and I love it! It is super fast and have so many awesome features!
I purchased my iPhone 4 after I realized all the kids on the block had a better iPhone than me. Most embarassing. This iPhone was worth the wait. SIRI and I are BFFs. I enjoy the iCloud feature to sync my iPad2 and iPhone4. Pics, videos, surfing the net & using the alarm (SIRI sets for me) iPhone 4 doesnt let me down. A must have.
Great all around camera.Great phone good for everything.
Siri is so cool. It's simple to use to use. The photos are beautiful as well.
This is my second iPhone, the 4S is replacing my 3GS, which has now pretty much become an iPod Touch for my daughter. Siri is a great compliment to iPhone experience. Using it to place calls, play a podcast or send a text hands free is great.
Very user friendly, easy to pick up and just go with. Very fast and not much waiting.
There is so much to like about the iPhone 4s. Form factor, look, operating system (especially after having been on Windows Mobile for the past several years). It works for me as phone, email, web tool, and mp3 player. A couple of critiques, the Siri personal assistant could be better with help to launch programs (other than the iOS programs related to contacts, calendar, todos, etc.). Battery life needs to improve, I work around that somewhat by not using push email and just checking the emails when I have time, turning Bluetooth off when not in use, etc. (not a burden for me, but could be problematic for professionals who need those all the time). Other than these, I am glad I purchased this phone.
This is my third generation of iPhones. Each generation gets better and faster and each iOS update brings more and more features that I use daily.
The new iPhone 4S is a must have product that will help with your productivity both at work and at home. With "Siri" (the built in personal assistant) you can do tasks quickly and efficiently with only a single touch of a button. The stability of the operating system will mean that you will not have to reboot/restart your cell phone for months. The free software updates that Apple gives keeps the phone packed with all of the new innovated products that Apples offers.
i upgraded from an iphone 4 so this is not a huge step up...but definitely still noticeable. if you are coming from a 3g or 3gs, the 4s is a huge step up. as most iphone users, i probably will not own another make of phone other than an iphone. its ease of use and simplicity is unparalleled. it has almost completely replaced my laptop. i pay all of my bills online with it, have my online banking set up on it, my personal and work email setup, and receive constant notifications for everything. it is ABSOLUTELY AWESOME!! to clear one thing up... I AM NOT an apple fanboy! I love my i7 quad core, ATI Radeon equipped windows laptop. you can keep your "overpriced for the hardware" macbooks!! But the iphone.....LOVE IT!!! P.S FOR YOU GEEKS.....AS I AM....... JB IT !!!!
70% of the time the phone calls don't connect with each other...I can hear them but they can't hear me or vice versa, unless it is hooked to a bluetooth and all call with go through.
I've had the 3G,3GS,iPhone 4 and now the 4S!i love the 4S it's soo fast with everything like web sites,opening apps,doing anything on it!the graphics are super fast and incredible as well as Suri is a great addition and makes life so much easier!I almost fogot about the camera its the fastest to take the best quality pics from a phone ive ever seen!Dont hesitate just buy it!!!!
My 3GS had less no sound issues! My 4S has a lot of background sounds when I'm on a call!! Sent one back to apple and I will say they were quick, happy and more than willing to replace it!! Which will probably keep me with apple for the long haul because custome service is so important and they were awesome!! New iphone4S has the same back ground noise. Not always there but a lil annoying when it is.
I upgraded from an iPhone 3GS and love the new capabilities of the phone. For me, those capabilities also include what many have already been enjoying with the iPhone 4 such as FaceTime. I was fortunate enough for my pre-order to come in right before a business trip as I was able to use FaceTime to talk with friends and family while on the road. It works great and is a fun way to interact other than the regular voice call. The screen resolution is fantastic, although if you already have an iPhone 4 it might not be such an improvement for you. I use the phone to view YouTube and Netflix streaming from time to time and the picture quality is excellent. The sound quality is better than my 3GS, but is still probably the weak link in the multimedia experience; especially if you are in a place with a fair level of background noise. Then again, that's the case with a lot of smart phones I've played around with. Siri is great when it's available. There have already been a few instances where the service has been down. When it does work though it is amazingly useful. Especially in situations where you can't give your screen your undivided attention. Battery life has been good, but there are things that I do to conserve energy. For example, I turn off Bluetooth, reduce the screen brightness and tweak other settings. In doing so, I only really need to charge up about every other day and I do a lot on my phone. Overall I'm very satisfied with the phone.
I couldn't live without it my business depends on it!!
Awesome features, love the white look, Siri is my new girl friend. phone speed is pretty good. love the speed of operation. would definitely get the next iPhone. Camera is awesome, you can throw your point and shoot cameras away if you got this phone. Battery life is good but has been fading after a few times of letting it drain to less than 20%.
They just work, it isn't the size of brick, fits in any pocket nicely. Works flawlessly, very incredible product. Fit and finish is supreme. The materials it is made out of give it a very high quality feel. The touch screen is so responsive and SIRI is one of the coolest things I have ever experienced. Another home run for the team @ Apple. This is my third iPhone, each time I am amazed at what they come up with. Highly recommend these to anyone!
I just replaced my IPhone 3G phone with the lates IPhone 4S which I bough from Best Buy. And let me tell you the Phone is absolutely amazing. Also Best Buy handled this transfer in very professional and efficient manner. If anyone have not upgraded their IPhone I recommend people to do it as soon as possible. The Camera, SIRI and the Internet Speed everything is absolutely amazing.
Despite some of the really nice features of the phone, such as voice recording of e-mails, texts, etc..., the phone's battery does not last an entire workday, EVEN IF YOU DON'T USE IT!!! Though Apple is allegedly working on the problem, the phone NEVER should have been released. Using this phone, or rather not being able to use it, has been a complete nightmare. Also, the updated "operating system fix" actually made the battery life WORSE, not better.
The iPhone 4s is an exceptional product. Innovative , thoughtful , and user friendly . Any one can easily get the hang of this phone. I prefer this phone in white it gives it a sleek , clean look . The Internet on this phone is blazing fast . It's a great phone and packs a punch .
I had my 3gs for 2 years but it was smashed to pieces in a freak accident. I love my iPhone4s....it's fast and reliable and Siri is sooo much fun!
I have every version of iPhone. The 4s is by far the best. It is smarter than I am! Cannot live without it!
This phone has actually exceeded my expectations! It is fast, responsive, and the camera is fantastic.
Fast beautiful and easy to use. What else can you ask for?
It's a bit faster than the iphone 4, which I had previously. The battery life is considerably worse though. By 5PM I'm down to 35%. Multiple checks to email/facebook/foursquare is all I have done today. Maybe 20 text messages sent/received. So pretty pathetic for battery. Yes, I have auto-dim on and brightness at 75%. WIFI and BT are off. The phone is a lot more snappy compared to the iPhone 4. Sound/volume quality are equal. ATT is my service provider and for some reason I loose 3G often and then it re-connects. Not sure if it's the phone or the service provider. On a positive note the camera and video capabilities are amazing. Very impressive for a phone.
I've had all but the first generation and this is the best yet. The added antennas have boosted my 3G speed (AT&T).
Love this phone. Had a problem with the first one and new one has been fine ever since. Salesman was great except when I was having issues with the first one.
This phone with the A5 processor that is only clocked at 800mhz is faster than any phone on the market right now. iOS5 is very fast and fluid with no lag what so ever. If you are looking for a phone you should definitely get this phone. The apps on iOS are great, fun, and addicting. I moved from an android phone that also has a dual-core processor, but the A5 seemed so much faster. I do not regret moving from Android to iOS, i am happy with my phone and recommend you to get one!
Love it. I had an iphone 3GS 32 gig and it was awesome but what sets this apart for me are a few things.1.Siri.Having come from watching Star trek as a kid I never thought I would see the day, But it has arrived. REAL voice control, Speech to text that works and a helper, for me being a private music teacher, Siri is a God send.It Just works, and Siri has a funny bone as well, But a Real help in planing my day and week out. 2.The Dual core A5 Prosser is fast,3 The 8.0 Megapixel Cam 1080p HD Cam Is just awesome.Can't wait to use facetime and all the awesome apps. as well. The 1080p HD Video is sharp. If you have another phone be it a 3GS or android. Check out The Iphone 4S. I dont think you will be let down.I Think you will be Amazed.
I went form a 16 gb 3gs to the new iPhone 4s and I simply love it!!! Everything on this phone is amazing!!! Siri is absolutely great with all the things it does and it's only a beta still!!! It will get even better. Buy this phone you will love it! I will say do not buy a life proof case for it because they are terrible. Stick to the good old Otter Box for your protection of this phone. The life proof have terrible hearing when on the phone, I've got bad reception with the case on great without it. Stick to the otter box because this phone needs protecting. 90% glass front and back. don't take the chance on breaking it, buy a case. Wonderful phone needs protecting so go buy one!!!
iPhone 4s is a good phone, I'll give it 4.5 stars if I could. Its easy to use, easy to play around with, and it just works. I own a Galaxy S II, Dell Streak, and iPhone 3Gs and this phone is on par with the Galaxy S II. if your looking for something that just pick up and play then the iPhone 4s is it. Its way faster then the 3Gs, Looks good and feels solid. if you have an iPhone 4 I don't think this is for you and I would pass on this phone but us 3Gs owners been looking forward to this for a long time. Screen: While the Screen size is small 3.5 don't let it fool you. its still bright and vibrant and the games look amazing. still one of the best screens on a cell phone so far. Speed: Quick...So quick in everything it does. it blows the 3GS out of the water! any game that is optimize for the 4s certainly does look really good. its crazy because they are all running at a smooth frame rate. Web browsing is super fast I love it to death. don't let anyone tell you otherwise. Again if you have an iPhone 4 this may not be worth it for you. just wait til the iPhone 5 but us 3Gs owners are pleased. I am getting near full speed from AT&T in my area too. (Grandfathered unlimited data user) Apps: Same good apps are in the app store. Almost anything your looking for its almost certain its in the app store. and running perfectly I might add you won't be disappointed. it still has one of the best Ecosystems ever. Calls: Clear and loud for me (your experience may vary) haven't had a drop call yet but then again I am in a better area of AT&T. iOS5 / Siri / Camera: it improves on what was already one of the best mobile OS out there. Notification makes it a much more enjoyable experience. As for Siri, She works good as an assistant. I don't know what all the hype is about her but she does responds really well. just nothing I can see anyone really going crazy over. The cam on this thing is so much better then it ever have been before 1080p looks clean and clear. I'm not fully impressed since I have a Galaxy S II. but if you never seen it before on a phone your going to be happy to have it. Build Quality: Solid and it just feels right in the hand. just don't drop this phone at all. shoulder height will surely break the glass on the back so keep a case on this beauty. The bad: Well, The phone can get warm at times (much like my Samsung Galaxy S II) but this is something I experience with all Dual-core phones for some reason and when it get warm it drains the battery a lot but I haven't had this problem in a few days from my 4s. it seems to be operating normal. Overall: I just want to point out that this phone is not for Android junkies, its just not. if your coming from an android phone and that's all you've been using. I doubt you will be 100% happy especially if your so use to customizations. I suggest you guys get a Samsung Galaxy S II or Galaxy Nexus. But for iPhone owners that had a 3Gs and wanting to upgrade. I suggest you get the iPhone 4s. its a little hard to say if you have an iPhone 4 to feel the need to upgrade unless you want the 64Gb but trust me. the iPhone 4s improves on everything the iPhone before it was. I am pleased with it and glad that I added it to my collection of smartphones and I know you will too. It still have the best ecosystem, it still has the "just work" aspect and it still one of the best phones out there. buy it and enjoy!
its looks exactly like iPhone 4 yet it has more powerful specs and few new cool features. had it been redesigned, i'd give it a 5. siri is very helpful especially when you are driving. the one thing that reminds me i'd upgraded is that the one i got is white. (i had black on 4). all in all, this phone is still amazing despite being exactly look like an iPhone 4. unless you're a real techie, you wouldn't mind upgrading. who would thought you're holding a 4s, unless they start asking "can i try the sir?". :-/
I love my iPhone 4S! The battery life isn't what I expected but it might be because I have alot of apps. I am deleting the unused ones one by one. THe pics are awesome and love the front facing camera. I upgraded from 3GS so it is a big upgrade!
I swear by these, be sure to register this with Zagg because they will for real replace it if you can scratch or damage it! No questions asked!
The last screen protector I got did a great job at protecting but I couldn't appreciate the clarity of the screen on my phone. This protector does both jobs! I don't have to worry about my keys scratching it up or anything else that is in my purse. There are a few small dents where the "liquid" has protected the screen but it doesn't puncture or cut the plastic. I did happen to notice that a key started pulling on the plastic close to the speaker and camera. I just laid it back down and it was as good as new. If a few smudges don't bother you then you should be ok with this screen protector. Plus it has a lifetime warranty!
Great great screen protector it is clear! When igot he phone the best buy person put on there perfectly. Highly recommend
Ive always preferred the riged screen protectors. Although this is soft it's very clear. It also doesn't feel like your finger is sticking to the screen.
I like the cover, it seems very easy to clean and wipe off.
The older model stuck to my wallet and came off so i bought the HD version and wow what a big difference in the clarity. It is night and day difference. Even the feel is much smoother then its predecessor. Installation was pretty straight forward and simple.
A must for any smartphone owner! This product does not interfere with the touch sensitivity of my iPhone and makes me feel like my phone has a little Kevlar vest on.
I bought the upscale model and paid a little extra to have it installed for me at the store. Good move. They do not install as easy as the instructions read and with expert hands it went on perfectly and have had no trouble.
These Zag protectors are a must have. I use them on all my devices. Best of all, Best Buy installed for free. Sucks if you get hair or dust under it, but thats why I had them do it. Keeps the screen like new, just peel and replace if scratched.
Disappointed that the shield smears so fast and easily.
I don't know alot about screen protectors for smartphones, and this one was suggested by the Best Buy Mobile store when i bought my phone. They said the HD screen protectors are the way to go since i had a iPhone 4s - i don't know if i could tell the difference or not between a regular and a HD screen protector. All i know is that it protects my iphone screen and there aren't any large or visible bubbles on it that annoy me - i had the mobile guy put it on the phone for me. It looked like applying the screen to the phone was a little difficult - he had to use 3 different screens and it tool him 15 to 20 minutes. One of the screens had part of the logo cut on it, so it was a bad screen to begin with and the other kept getting smugged or had stuff getting stuck to it. I would HIGHLY recommend paying to have them put it on just in case there is a bubble or something wrong with the screen, that way they can just pull a new one off the shelf and you don't have to buy another one or return one that has a flaw. Make them keep putting it on until your happy b/c you're the one that has to look at the screen everyday.
Good cover. Would recommend if you drop phones a lot.
This shield protects the screen on my phone well. It keeps fingerprints and dust off of it, and protects it from scratches.
I've been very satisfied with the InvisibleShield HD for my iPhone. It is very durable, scratch resistant, and easy to clean. It is worth the money over the static cling type covers that rarely bond properly and bubble up, sometimes right away. Of course, this screen protector is highly dependent on how well it is installed. I installed one on my iPad successfully but it was a pain, and decided it was better to let Best Buy install this one. Worth the 7 bucks. The minor bubbles that may be there initially, go away within a day or so. Very pleased.
I heard great reviews about this protective screen and I think i just got a bad screen.
Looks pretty good so far (2 months) and I can see it's value to protect the phone screen. The store installed it and I get free replacements if it comes off. How can you lose on that?
This IPhone cover is just terrible. I've gone through three IPhones so this was the third time buying a cover and it was the most difficult to put on by far! I tried to make an adjustment to put the cover in place and basically ruined it. $30 down the drain. I would highly recommend consumers to look elsewhere for their cover.
Looked like it would be great since screen was glasslike. It was also easy to install (not sticky). Looked great for a couple of days... Now it's full of dents and I will need to replace.
I have used these Zagg protectors one every device that has a screen on it sense they started making them. This is the first time I've been disappointed. The clarity is Awsome on this HD version! For some reason, they made it just a little bit too small this time though. Mine keeps coming up around the edges with the cover I have.
I have had many phones and all of them have had screen protectors on them. This one is a waste of money, had bubbles days later and when I removed it to reapply it became hazy.
I swear by Zagg. I have it on my tablet, kindle and my iPhone 4s. All of my products look like I just pulled them out of the package for the first time. This is by far the best screen protector out there. If you get it pay the extra $8 to have it installed. you wont regret it.
It does help protect your screen but it also gets dirty, and scratched up and you have to pay $4 shipping to get a replacement. I know you can ship this thing for 50 cents. So that is a rip-off to me.
Very durable works great with the phone I'll save you money
I would not reccomend this product. It does a good job at protecting your phone. It makes the phone looks really dirty, especially if you have a white Iphone. It looks really scratched and feels funny when touched.
This is a case friendly zagg so you don't have to worry about the edges getting torn up. If it is installed properly you literally cannot tell it's on your phone. If you're unsure how to install or don't want the mobile associates to do it just watch a youtube video it's not too hard. It's much better than the smudge proof zagg because it doesn't take away from the amazing display on the iPhone. It seems to last longer and look better than the standard zagg. With the lifetime warranty you can't go wrong for the price.
This was put in by somebody that worked at Best Buy. There is a few small bubbles. But they are not that bad. You can barely tell that they are there.
Seems like a nice product. Nice clear picture but a couple of weeks after I had my phone the Zagg was starting show signs of wrinkles that appeared, so maybe in wasn't applied properly.
This screen protector is great!! It is the case friendly version just like the box said and protects from all sorts of scratches. The only downside I have found is that BB charges $10 too much. For $5 more of what I paid in the store, I could have gone to zagg.com and purchased the HD Maximum Coverage screen protector which completely covers the front, the back, and all the sides. Too bad BB doesn't carry this.
the film is sticking pretty good to the 4s phone. the only draw back is with the Olloclip lenses. The lens does attach over the film without tearing it off. It leaves an indentation in the film but it disappears by the end of the day. This film was recommended by the Best Buy mobile tech and she put it on. I knew nothing about them as this is my first smartphone. It was a pretty good choice though, I'm happy with it.
THIS SHIELD IS AMAZING ITS LIKE A SOFT GEL NOT A HARD PLASTIC SO IF ANYTHING HITS THE PHONE IT WILL GIVE AND NOT TEAR OR SCRATCH AND YOU CANT EVEN TELL ITS ON THE PHONE ITS ALWAYS CLEAR
I had the Best Buy employee install the shield (really, the $8 is worth it!) and it fits perfectly with no bubbles at all. It seems fairly tough and resistant, but I could see how the edges, by not covering the entire face of the phone, might be able to peel up with use; it has not so far. Overall, I would recommend this product, though the price is a little high.
When I first applied this shield, I almost thought I ruined my phone! You have to follow the instructions carefully & spray the sticky side with the little bottle of solution they give you, then apply it -It had all kinds of hazey patches & bubbles, but the directions said they would work out in a day, and they did. The finished product is beautiful -VERY GLOSSY - VERY CLEAR- no haze whatsoever!
I could kick myself for letting the Best Buy sales guy talk me into buying this very expensive ($30) piece of garbage! He went on and on about how great this HD screen shield was! When I got it home, I cleaned the counter, washed my hands & made sure that the iphone screen was 100% clean & without a spec of dust. I then spritzed the screen and started to apply the film per the instructions. I was able to line it up pretty well right off the bat. I used the squeegee to get the excess water out but there were still little air bubbles that would not budge! The shield started looking more & more splotchy as the day went on. I finally took it back to Best Buy but they would not accept the return because I had used it! I was also told that if I would have paid the additional $8 to have it "INSTALLED", they would have taken it back! Poor product & poor customer service from Best Buy --- certainly not anything I've ever experienced in all the years I've been shopping at BB!
I knew from previous mobile phones that the devices are prone to nicks and scratches from day to day use. Because the iPhone uses a touch screen, it will get smudged and dirty. The ZAGG invisible shield enables me to keep my iPhone looking new and the screen crystal clear. It took a steady hand to install it, but with a bit of patience it can be done by just about anyone.
I guess it does the job of protecting the screen but it is not seamless, I was hoping I could not even notice that it was there, but it is noticeable.
Overall a great product. Not too happy with the price, but it definitely has protected my screen quite a lot - since I usually have my phone in my pocket - sometimes with my keys in it.
I have always used Zagg screens for my iphones, ipads and itouches - until now. I always loved how they went all the way to the edge of the screen - never a snag, nothing. Now they have changed to the "case friendly" design - which i am sad to say, after $30, lasted all of two months (not destroyed but wont stay on the phone anymore). Since it is not going to the edges, it gets caught - on everything - from my fingernail, to something in my purse, to the edge of the darn mophie juice pack - it was a mess - once it was even stuck to my face LOL. I will NOT spend the money anymore on ZAGG as this was a true waste for a product that i depended on. They have also stopped putting "anti glare/anti smudge" on the product packaging - now, does this mean that they dont do that anymore or are we supposed to assume that yes it does protect from this, we just dont need to mention it anymore? and WTH is with the "HD" screen?? seriously? LOL
For the high price I expected a flawless protector. That's not hat I got. The surface of the protector looks like someone used an object and attempted to mar the surface. Next time I'll try a cheaper brand which by my experience are just as effective as Zagg. Plus they are easier to install.
I purchased the 4s " new" cover. It doesn't cover the whole screen and the edges want to peel off. I'm not happy with this product. I've already purchased 3 sets in the past. And if you try to do the " free" replacement you have to send in your old " damaged " protector. It doesn't cover the peeling. For the price I am not at all satisfied. It does protect from scratches , but it peels off to easily. Especially in the corners. Btw I am an engineer and I do know how to properly put the "shield" on.
The Zagg cover is a nice product. Easy to install and does the job. My only complaint is the price. Quite high for what you actually are buying.
Even tho it's not expensive, it's still not worth it - according to the Apple experts. He told me that the face is so hard, if you were to scratch the face, you would break it.
Not a HUGE fan of this, but then again I don't like most screen protectors!!
I dont like to give bad reviews for things, but this one needs to be known! We purchased this at the Bestbuy store for $25,99 Then it cost $14.99 to have it installed totaling $40.98 we were told that this was the best shield in the store for the i phone. Its junk! its soft and you can snag it with your fingernail and leave permanent marks and scratches in it. it is only a few weeks old and is all scratched up and marked to heck. Dont know what happened to the military grade stuff, but this is not it , by far. its not on the phone anymore.
Great product can't even tell it's on there. Best Buy salesperson installed it and it looks good, no bubbles, no hint of anything on the screen at all.
This screen protector is made of elastic, glass-cling material. As such: 1) Installation requires surgically clean utensils, as the adhesive will not stick to the face of your iPhone wherever it has contacted a non-sterile object. 2) The adhesive must also contain the substance that law-enforcement uses to lift fingerprints. If, for even a moment, you touch the back of this product with your fingers, you will have immortalized your fingerprint like an insect in amber. 3) There will be bubbles. Period. Your only recourse is to peel the material back and try again; during this process, you're extremely likely to enjoy points 1 and/or 2 above. 4) The material is only "glass-like" (as per the manufacturer's description) if we're talking about glass panes produced in the sixteenth century - filled with bubbles and about as smooth as denim.
I thought it was easy to install, I am not super picky as long as it protects my phone I a happy do not notice any little bubbles, finger prints, or weird colors.
Perfect protection for the screen and doesn't distort the view
I had the ZAGG Invisible Shield HD installed by Best Buy which to me was worth the $7.99. He had it done in just a few minutes. The Shield HD is amazing!!!!!!! It's very clear and still pretty slick feeling. I feel it is less tacky feeling than the original Invisible Shield. It is hard to tell the Shield HD is even on the phone. I would highly recommend this shield. If you want to maintain the crystal clear look of the graphics of the iPhone but yet protect the screen, this is an excellent product!!!!
Superior better battery life than my last droid. Boot up superior fast does not lock up.
Best phone I've ever had (but that's not saying too much, since I've had mostly pretty bad phones and even the good ones weren't as good as this one: iPhone 4s)
Lousy quality audio just like the rest of the iPhones. Would like to be able to remove unused icons on Home screen.
Finally 1 device, after toting a phone an iPod and a planner for a few years I finally have one device. 5,700 songs, my e-mail, 4 calendars, and to do lists all in one.
Switched from Android to iPhone - - love the decision.
The iPhone 4s is definitely worth the investment for those coming into the Apple fold or for those who may still have the iPhone 3. Any iPhone 4 user would be better of waiting for the next iPhone as the features are not that much of an upgrade. Siri is a funny and useful new feature - however her propinquity to her network is her greatest downfall. Siri not only seems to required a network signal, but a very strong one. Also often she has a hard time understanding what was said, which can lead to some very colorful exchanges between the operator and her. Kudos to Apple for all the humor that was embedded within this little gem. Siri is overall a great new feature and with some polish, she will become and industry standard.
Something is wrong with OS5, before you purchase, take a look at apple.com and look at the 499 pages of people complaining. Will they every have an update for the OS5.0.1 that fixes the battery issue?
Overall the phone is great only down fall is it is only 3G would be best phone ever if 4g
Switched from HTC 4G Evo to Sprint iphone 4s when they came out. Don't get me wrong, the HTC Evo is a great phone and I can't say enough good things about it, however, the iphone 4s has edged it out in my book because of Siri and the icloud concept. While the Evo has 4G, I haven't noticed that the 4s being any slower. I do hope Apple and Adobe flash come to an agreement soon, as the Evo works with Adobe flash and it's videos and the Apple 4s does not. While the screen is smaller than the Evo, it is crystal clear and the camera function works well. Speaking of screens, make sure you get an Otter Box because the Apple 4s screen is pure glass. I'm extremely pleased with the 4s!
This is really great iphone. I am really like it. Thanks to Apple Inc.
what My Review Hove The Phone. i Just Love The Phone its A Beautiful Thing Since Apple Make This
I love my new shell case for my IPhone 4! I had gotten several compliments!
This case is a perfect fit. It doesn't add bulk to the phone yet covers the back and sides completely. I soft texture of the case really makes it easy to carry.
I love this cover. It is a tight fit on the phone and feels very good on the hands.
I've only had this 24 hours, but it fits my needs and improves upon the apple iphone bumper...mainly (1# a thin bumper that doesn't feel bulky in my front jeans pockets and slides in and out easily #old iphone bumper was sticky# #2# a larger port hole in the bottom that fits my car connector cable #hole in old iphone bumper was too small for 3rd party connectors# #3# clear cover on the back still shows my iphone skin #I wanted a bumper that fit 1 & 2 above and this case was as close as I could find# Only possible negative is that the rubber at the bottom around the docking port hole is a bit thin and it feels like it may rip in the future...hence the 4 stars instead of 5. But for the combination of price #1/2 of otterbox), larger port holes, slim fit, and clear back, I'm very happy.
I like the edging that muffles sound when you lay the phone down, keeps the phone anchored in place on hard surfaces, and cushions the phone from shocks.
I love this case! Great price! I like how it feels and how easy it was to put on my phone. I had dropped the iphone 4 many times and my son helped a time or two-- it seemed to give great protection being that my phone didn't break at all. It didn't make my phone feel bulky. It fit nicely-- no problems with any the buttons or charging port. I would buy this again! I had 4 of my friends also buy this case! I do wish it came in more colors.
Case only has rubber covering the corners.... Case doesn't protect the screen what so ever
In purchasing this case you still need to purchase a screen protector. Since purchasing this case <45 days ago I have thrown it away and purchased the Otterbox Defender, loved it so much we got our son one too,
I had this case on my iPhone 4 for about a year and a half, and it did an excellent job protecting my phone. And I am NOT very gently with my phone (drop it occasionally, leave it everywhere, shove it in bags, etc.). It fits and slides into my pockets relatively easily (coat, pants, bags) and protects very well. I liked it so much that I searched until I found it again for my 4S (lost my last one) - thanks for carrying it, Best Buy. This case is the pefect balance of protection and slim/minimal design. If you want slim and not much protection, go with no case or a slim hardcase. Or if you like massive protection, then go with one that looks like it's made from off-road tires. But if you want the best of both, this case is great.
excellent case, it protects my iPhone perfectly, it's durable and best of all it don't stick to clothing like other rubber cases do, making it very easy to get in and out of my coat and pant pockets.
its overpriced and poorly crafted. the plastic is floppy around the bottom and top edges, it feels like its about to rip.
There is nothing really wrong with this case. It is attractive enough and does not cover the back of the phone except with clear plastic; therefore, the Apple logo is visible. The cover can be easily removed and put back on. My real complaint about this case is that it does not provide sufficient protection in the event the phone is dropped. I actually kept this case for about a month and subsequently replaced it with an Otter Commuter case which provides more protection.
I bought this cover for my brand new iPhone 4S and found that it made the phone feel bulky and awkward to hold.
This case is very flimsy. I would not recommend buying one.
I ordered this online based on its looks. But when it arrived it turned out that the plastic was very slippery and the bevel of the surface and the clear circles creates an uneven surface that is very impractical. It slides off of all but the perfectly flat surfaces. And even when on a flat surface, you can't use the phone as it tilts. I'm returning it.
It's great if you want Otter Box like protection and extra battery life. I just removed the speaker covers, like one of the users recommended and it solved the problems of the echo and flash reflection. In my opinion it's expensive, for having to take off covers to keep it from interfering with phone performance. But, it's shock proof, I dropped mine on the pavement by accident and the case and my phone were unscathed. The battery is great also, I kept my bluetooth and wifi on all day and part of the evening, and didn't have to plug-in once. It was expensive, but I got what I was looking for, after I removed the speaker and camera covers, and I don't think taking the covers off really sacrifices all that much protection (it's not advertised to be water proof, just splash and rain resistant), just don't squirt water directly into the speakers and you're good, and it doesn't effect the appearance of the case in my opinion.
Due to all the negative reviews for this case, I opted to purchase it from BestBuy instead of mophie.com. Results: Pros: Durable, shock absorbing, somewhat weather proof. Cons: -Effectively nullifies the use of playing music out of phone speakers. The max volume is essentially lowered by 50% due to the full encasement of your device. -Camera Flash Incompatibility: Back plastic covering of camera port captures flash reflection and destroys any image you are attempting to take. (Must have flash disabled or reflection turns half the picture white) -Front screen is extremely thin and easily picks up scuffs & scratches. -Port cover flaps are thin rubber and require extreme caution not to over bend, stretch, or snag and rip off. (Eventually with time, the rubber will dry out and these will simply crack off) -Overheating: For a case designed for rugged outdoor use, it raises the temperature of the iPhone to an unusable threshold when in direct sunlight as the case acts as an oven. -If you have a zagg screen on your phone the integrated screen cover will stick to it and cause air pockets where it adheres to the zagg and skews your visibility, I would assume this is the case for other covers as well. I used their provided screen cover as well and the same issue occurs. In the end I simply removed it. -Echo Issues: The person on the other end of your phone call will receive echo feedback from the sound reverberations through your case and reflect back their own voice as well as yours. Due to all the negative flaws in the design of this case, I have returned this to my Best Buy within 3 days of testing. If Mophie manages to fix the echo, flash reflection, over-heating, replace the "integrated" plastic screen film with gorilla glass or a sturdy scratch proof cover then this may be more of a contender against a lifeproof case. I've decided to stick with my JuicePack Plus for the time being and hope that these issues can be ironed out. I was looking forward to having the best of both worlds having 2500mAH and weatherproofing but this case would not be the one that does it. Stick with either the Juicepack Air or Plus if you're looking for doubling your battery life in the day. Proud owner of 4 other juice pack airs/plus over the years but this one is the first Mophie case that I am extremely disappointed in. For a $139 price point with taxes, I would suggest buying one in a local best buy to test it out for yourself so you don't need to deal with the RMA and hassle of dealing with mophie directly.
I just purchased this case and I must say it protects your iPhone much like the Otterbox defender series. I've been waiting for a case that protects and increases battery life. Before this case you had to pick one or the other. The only slight problem I see is that users will experience an echo for their callers while in the case. However, this is an easy fix, just remove the small covers for the speaker / microphone on the bottom and the one near the earpiece. You will also have to remove the clear cover for the camera as the flash reflects back. The company made this to be water resistant but i dont take a bath with my phone so it didnot matter to me to remove the above mentioned items Other than those small issues I think all users will enjoy.
Great case overall, with a couple of exceptions. The case is a beast I must say. But a couple of things that make it not worth the $130. The sound is muffled and the volume is reduced somewhat. The echo is also there, noticeable on the other callers end. Also, the included screen cover watermarks instantly once it hits the phone. I have an otterbox and have owned the survivor and neither of those cases do this. Great overall idea if the kinks can be worked out.
Overall product is a good idea. Pricey so I expected it to hold up rather well, but just after a few days, my charging port on the bottom right corner started to move and is not able to keep a charge unless the phone is sitting in a certain position. Also the last battery cell is not charging and it maybe a defect, I have contacted mophie, but no response as of yet. Will update when I get a resolution. Other than that, just be weary and careful with the charging port, other than this, the product is very useful when the phone is about dead and you need some juice.
I love the fact that I can go all day with my phone without plugging it in. Also, because I work outside, it protects it. But this thing is big and weighs too much. I also had to ship my first unit back because of a bad echo on the other end of my phone call. They did replace it free of charge without a problem. all shipping was paid. I suggest getting the plus. much more compact.
It is a great Case/Battery for the IPhone 4S. I would recommend to anyone looking to double or triple the battery life of the Iphone. Protects if dropped. and some serious splash protection.
I would have given it 5 stars but the flaw with the echo. There is a real easy fix for it. All you have to do is remove the 2 little black speaker covers at the bottom of the case. This was never a waterproof phone so its not bothering anything. After that, the echo is gone. I knew about the issue before I bought the case, but I simply had to have it. Called Mophie and they are sending out kits to everyone who purchased this case within the next few weeks that will fix the problem for everyone. The extra battery is amazin. I am always on my phone so I need the boost. Doesn't affect phone signal or sound. This phone case is worth every penny.
If you can deal with the extra weight an bulkiness then its a great case. Anyone who works outdoors construction, landscaping stuff like that it would be well worth it. This case is durable! The built in charger will keep your battery going for days. But for carrying all day it's just to big and heavy. It actually was pulling my pants down when I had it in the belt clip at work. Returned it next day and went back to the good ol otter box. Much cheaper and half as bulky.
I work for an EMS company. This cover is great because I do not have to worry about the battery life, but that is where the good stops. The screen got a scratch while I was putting it on the phone. The sound is ok on both ends. I found out that when I tried to take a photo with flash, the flash would bounce back on the left side back to the camera. This renders the use of camera with a flash useless.
No doubt about it the juice pack pro has it's drawbacks. It makes your phone big and bulky but if you are going to do something where you plan on using your phone and cannot charge it this is a good thing to have. Once your battery gets to low battery status you simply turn the switch from red to green and it fully charges your phone. Great for people who uses their phone for active sports such as biking, hiking, anything where you use a map app that drains the battery quickly. I haven't had a problem with the echo like others have, have not had to remove any part of the case in order to make it work better. The bottom line is you need to know what you're looking for before you buy this case. It's not for everybody but it is incredibly functional if you need a much longer battery life. If you can put up with a bigger, heavier phone in order to have a longer battery life then this case is a good option. If not buy the Lifeproof or wait til another option comes along.
This is a great product except for the fact that the screen covering scratches with normal use. It has no durability whatsoever. I returned the product for that reason
Overall not a bad concept. But I would recommend the next level down which you can buy a belt clip for. I gave that one to my girlfriend and bought the bigger one. Wished I didn't.
i almost past one month since i bouth it and the click of the case is failling! it si have warranty? for how long??
I bought this phone because I had a Mophie Juice Pack + which stopped charging my phone. When I exchanged it I decided to go big or go home. I should've just gone home. This thing is huge, it's turned my smart phone into a massive growth on my hip. Thankfully it's a shock resistant case because I hit it on just about everything I walk past. The battery life is ok, I don't really see a huge improvement over the 2000 mAh case. I like being able to charge my phone without having to find a cord as I am a pilot and I work full time as well as being a single pilot. There are days where I simply am not near any sort of charging device. My main complaint is that lately, as soon as I unplug my phone from it's nightly charging session my phone drops to 98%. Now, I believe I'm sort of defeating the purpose if I start off less than 100%. A secondary complaint is the sheer bulk and clunkiness of the design. It's nearly impossible to keep in a pocket, so if you don't have the clip on your side, you must hand carry it everywhere.
The white part catches denim dye very easily. I like my phone in my back pocket, so blue is now a part of the color scheme. The earbud hookup hole on top is not big enough to fit my auxiliary cord. I have to take the case off to listen to music in my car.
The Otterbox protects my iPhone from damage. I like that it comes with a screen protector as well.
fits perfect around the phone and protects well, although would have like to have something cover the face of the phone.
This case does the trick and balances protection with a slimmed down profile.
The protection with a combination of soft rubber and hard plastic is the best balance for a protective case that stays trim and attractive.
The Commuter is a great case for anyone needing a more slimline case for their iPhone instead of the more bulky Defender. I also got the Zagg screen protector to help with the areas not covered by this case. My only complaint is that I wish I had chosen a different color. Mine is pink plastic with white silicone. The silicone has a tendancy to discolor. After only a week of use it was already showing usage. Other than my not thinking ahead, there is really nothing bad I can say about this case. I love pink and when the salesguy brought out the multitude of accessories I went straight to this case and not the black one for obvious reasons.
This otter box has already saved my iphone many times. Have had the phone drop from waist high distance and NO problems with the phone.
My wife uses her phone constantly, after the first few days of use. The white rubber part of the phone started to get dark. When I first saw this, I regretted buying this, because I should of know this would happen with this white material. My wife tried to clean it to get it back to looking clean. Unfortunately, that was not possible. You think the company would do a better job of testing these cases and work on the caveats, especially after spending $40 on a case. To say I am disappointed is an understatement
This is a great add-on for iphones used by kids, provides good protection from being dropped.
This case is a little hard to get on the phone at first but once it is on it is not going anywhere. I feel like my phone is safe I am every happy with this case
There are others on the market that fit better, but this is a good one
The case is a very slim and lightweight addition to the phone that does not get in the way of anything, except during charging. The Cut out for the Car Charger to connect is not big enough, so it frequently disconnects, but if you flip off that end, it is fine. An Annoyance, not a biggie.
Bought the case for my 15 year old son and he is very particular, Kudos to the manufacturer, My son loves it. The case itself is light but strong, looks awesome too
I got this because it was on special when I bought my phone. I like the texture and that it is not bulky at all. I also like the non-slip feel of it. This was the most basic color I could find at the Best Buy store I was at. The other options were few and not my style. But I am pretty gentle with my phones and so I went to Amazon and got a pretty case more my style. And also, not black so my phone now stands out more on a table full of smartphones. I like the case and still have it. I am sure I will switch back when the new one gets beat up.
Great design and lots of grip. It offers better than average protection for the price. Case pricing can be absurd nowadays. I am very rough with it and I have had no problems with the phone being damaged. It feels really good too. Easy to get on and off fast. Mine is starting to flex a little at the top and bottom because I remove it constantly (I only use it when I do outdoor activities).
Unable to charge phone well with this case on, and I barely use it because of this. I also don't believe it provides Icy protection. Like the look of it-
Great product. This case fits nice and snug around the iPhone 4S. It was easily installed and provides a fantastic look and feel to the iPhone. Every port is exposed for access. I am able to charge the device without having to take off the case. The only issue I have is that with the case on the sleep/power button is not as easy to push as I would like. I was actually expecting a silicone type material and discovered it is a harder material, which I think provides a little more protection. The holes provide a great grip on the device. The device slides easily in and out of my pocket. Highly recommend if you are looking for a slim case and moderate protection for your iPhone.
Purchase this because the iphone is very slick. This keeps it from sliding around in a vechicle or on a table top or desk. Also provides a good grip when you're holding it.
I've used this on 2 long runs and many short ones, so far it works great. The only drawback is the plastic screen. it makes it hard to see and it is not real touch sensitive.
Might work well for some but not so great for me. Doesn't fit if you have bigger arms
I am a road cyclist and love this arm band for my I Phone. It adjusts to anyone's arm size and keeps my phone in place while I ride. This allows me to listen to music on my rides which is so helpful and much needed on long rides!
Poorly made paid way too much this should be priced at $9.95 to match how badly it's made. Ugly looking and not good for larger arms. Total waste of money!
I hate having to remove my iPhone from its OtterBox to use this. The plastic is not tight enough, so I am unable to use the touchscreen to access my workout apps. I wish I had not wasted my money on this.
Do not bother wasting your money on this item. The armband is either too loose or too tight. It was slipping off of my arm during my entire work out. The screen protector feels like cheap plastic that isn't tight to the screen. In other words, when you try to swipe on your phone, you can't because the plastic is too loose to do so. I can't even begin to tell you how disappointed with this purchase I am. I will be returning the item tomorrow.
The neoprene material makes my arm really hot when exercising. Fastening buckle is more challenging than the Belkin FastFit. Got that model when I returned this one.
In order to place your iPhone in the armband, you must first take it out of the other protective case you may have the device in, then slide it into the armband. It is a pain to constantly swap from one form or protection to the other. After doing this for a week, both protective covers are now loose. I would like to find a case that snaps on to an armband. I had one like this for my previous iPods, and never had any issues.
Overall a good case but the film for front of phone didn't fit. Had to get ghost armor for screen
I recently purchased this case and have found it to be fine until I noticed one huge flaw. I'll start with the positive. Case looks good, has a great feel, and seems well built. The red/black combo really looks quite nice, better than a solid red case IMO. The soft touch finish feels great in hand. I was in love with this case till I used my iPhone to take a photo while in the case. If you do this and use the flash, your picture will have a red tinge due to the case being too close to the flash and light bouncing off the case when the flash goes off. It is a serious problem for me and I am going to see if I can return my case. I have included two photos taken seconds apart (long enough for me to remove the case) so you can see the drastic impact this case has on photo quality when the flash is used. These photos were only 30 seconds apart and the only thing I changed was removing the case.
Been through quite a few iPhone 4s cases and never found one as good as this for overall protection and comparability with a holster clip. The case itself is the best one I've had yet, offering double protection with the soft gel case that's bolstered with a snap on harder plastic shell that grips and protects the corners very well. It's a really durable case and looks likely to be solid for a long time to come which is where all the others I've owned failed. Best of all it comes with a great clip in belt holster. Had many belt holsters to date, none of which lasted more than 3 months but this is one is again solid and durable and shows no sign of wear/ tear after 3months. Very easy to clip phone in and out, appears well made, and is by far the best case and holster combo I've found yet for the iPhone. I'm using it daily for business and would highly recommend.
If you're looking for a rugged case to carry your iPhone while you're working this probably won't be sufficient. I work on a ranch and this just didn't keep the dust and dirt away from the phone.
worked pretty good although I returned it. I decided I needed a leather case with a cover for the front of the phone as well. As for these kind of clip cases I was very happy with it. You can clip the phone in either front or rear facing. The phones feels very secure when clipped in the bracket. BTW.. I'm finding some leather cases online but you have to order them from China or Hong Kong. It takes a little while but they do eventually arrive. Why these are not available locally I don't understand. Very good quality. Look up HOCO.
Its awful it costs way too much money to be broken after a few weeks.
Like a complete Gomer, I slammed my iPhone in my car door. With the back spider-webbed, I needed a case that would enclose the phone and allow me to continue to use it until the iPhone5 comes out (and I can upgrade). The hard plastic back is awesome because it allows me to get it out of my pocket WAY more easily than rubber cases. I also like that there are rubber pieces that protect the headphone jack and charging port. (minimizes pocket lint, dust and risk of water damage) My only issue is that I've had it about a month and the rubber is split near the mute button.
Just a few years ago, Otterbox made very good and durable cases. Recently, I have been through two of these cases. The first one lasted a grand total of about six months and then the plastic outer shell cracked and broke at the bottom where the plug is inserted (I am very easy on my stuff and work a desk job). So, I got another and that one lasted a grand total of about two months. I took that one off the phone to hand wash in cold water. When I put it back on the phone, I found that the plastic piece had warped and no longer fit snugly on the phone so it was snagging my pocket as I took it out. As I said before, Otterbox used to make great products, but now I think they are more concerned about quantity rather than quality.
Dropped my iphone from about 6ft into the concrete. The phone landed on the top left corner. Caused a nice dent on the hard plastic part of the case and absolutely nothing done to my phone.
I love this case. I've dropped my phone a few times and this case certainly saved the day on those few occasions. The look is definitely professional and sleek and I wouldn't pick another case!
I have two older teenage boys that I have purchased these for. They have proven to be less than durable. Maybe if you never use headphones with your phone, or never dock your phone they would last longer. Both of them have had two sets...was trying to give the product another chance. But will move on to something else now.
Good protection but the rubber cushion under the outer case shifts, taking it in and out of my pocket, and I have to remove the cover and reset it.
Returned twice. 1st one rubber protection got lose during the first 3 days. 2nd one case cracked after a week. Went with a different case. Not worth the price. Paying for the name brand.
Great case for the DROPPER in your family, some times you have that slippery hands family member, this is their case!
Overall, this a very durable case without being unnecessarily cumbersome. I would say that this case provides the "best of both worlds" satisfaction of protection without feeling like you're holding a brick. Well worth the money.
This is a good case that is not too bulky and protects the phone.
If you're looking for a case that really PROTECTS, this is definitely the case. It is bulky and thick, but it's not too bad. You get used to it, and I think the benefits definitely outweigh the alternative of breaking the phone, because I drop my phone A LOT. It works well, and the built in screen protector is nice because then you don't have to apply one, however after a while mine got a weird rainbow-ish bubble thing (that was only visible when the screen was off). It still works fine though, and if you're really worried about it i've heard of people punching out the screen protector and adding their own ZAGG. I will say that the bulkiness of the case does mess with the signal just a bit. My wifi/3g takes a tad longer to load and I don't always have full bars, even on the wifi in my house. Overall though, love the case and the color is great. I keep other cases too to switch between, but when I know i need protection this is the case for me. It is a little pricey, but I think it will last.
Fell in love with the color scheme, the cover goes on easily and does not interfere with the camera. I often like to switch covers (currently rocking an old school Gameboy cover) and wish that the Gameboy cover was of a similar quality to this cover (the Gameboy one interferes with flash pictures). The old saying is true-you get what you pay for. (Go with the accessory bundle package to save some $$)
This case provides SOME protection from accidental drops. The case on the phone is not bulky at all, but It feels slightly slippery in the hand, so gripping it may be an issue with some people. I wish I could find it in more colors. The essential 050 is hard to find for some reason.
Picked this case up when I bought my iPhone 4S on Sunday. I got it mostly because bb was having an accessories deal but I'm glad I did! Fits snuggly around the iPhone. The case is well made and all buttons and the headphone jack are easily accessible. Will protect from short drops and bumps but nothing major. Overall a great case!! The color looks really nice too against the white iPhone! Good case if your looking for something smaller.
All in all I like it....but I'm a little harder on my phone than I thought I would be so may have to also purchase an Otterbox.
Nothing fancy or impressive... I probably should have gotten a different color... anyway, it's fair...
I had two slider style cases that just didn't work. One broke near near the volume button area (weak design) and one comes apart every time I pull the phone out of my pocket. This one is fantastic. A little weird at first being a two part case but great once you get used to that. The hard shell is easy to take off (a requirement for putting it in a jogging case or speaker dock) and the rubber inner cover does seem to cushion it well. If it came in green we'd have two.
Got this and a screen for $35; pretty good deal, I suppose. Haven't dropped it yet, so still have to wait and see how well it protects the phone.
We bought this case and it arrived with a black front, not a blue one. Thinking it was a mistake, we brought it back to the store, checked the image online and the sku numbers and tried again. Black again. If you want the Otterbox phone case with a blue front, you will have to purchase it from another store. This one is black on the front, not blue, but no one at Best Buy.com can figure out the problem.
fit my iPhone 4 well, can put ID card or something else, easily accesse
This holster clips securely to my belt. It holds my iPhone snuggly enough that it won't fall out on accident, but not so tight that it becomes tough to remove. The magnetic closures hold secure as well. My primary beef with it is that it has a fuzzy lining that lets off from the very first use. I'm constantly having to wipe the fuzz off of my screen. I bought it due to the style and price. I think I'll probably go with one of the Otterbox Defenders instead.
With the Iphone 5 out, I finally upgraded to the 4s for a great price. The pictures from the default camera are great, display is sharper. My favorite improvement though is the much better sound on this model. The one thing I'm not impressed with is Siri. While entertaining, it generally cannot find what I'm looking for, usually redirecting to something similar. For instance, I ask for home painters and it gives me a list of retail paint shops. You have to be very, very specific and even then Google Voice will usually do a better job. Also, the battery life isn't the greatest. I make sure to delete apps from memory if I'm not currently using them.
It's a good phone. New keypad functions really well. Mic doesn't seem to work as well as my last phone and if the reception is weak, the phone beeps in your ear a lot. Camera works well but only for close up shots.
- Solid/Secure - Mounts to any bike. Mounted mine on Ritchey stem despite irregular cross-section. - Ball joint allows landscape or portrait or anything in between - easy to insert and remove phone - minimalist design (simple, few parts, lightweight), but if you're shaving grams you probably don't want your iphone mounted to your bike. - heads up...requires Lifeproof case (over the top protection which you may not like for everyday use).
I purchased the LifeProof case a few months ago and love it (it really works by the way. I have gone swimming with my phone in my hand). Anyway, I also use my bike quite a bit for exercise and was happy that LifeProof has a bike mount to use with their case. It is extremely easy to mount and safely and securely holds your phone on your bike. The mount allows you to rotate the phone in any direction you choose and the LifeProof case gives you easy access to your phone. If you are a bike rider this will be a great addition.
I am an obsessive 365-days-a-year bike commuter, and when I got a Lifeproof case for Christmas, I had to have one of these. (I LOVE my case, too, by the way.) Someone who knew something about bikes and cycling designed this. It comes with three different rubber shims to allow it to fit various handlebar clamp sizes (all the way up to 31.8mm). The ball mount allows you to tilt it in lots of different directions. It's easy to get your phone in and out, and it has an easy-to-use lock that you can slide so that you can be certain it won't fly off your bike (and it REALLY won't--more on that below). The mount itself also comes off very quickly and easily so that you can take it with you when locking your bike up in an area where it might get stolen. Since I've had this mount, I've had two crashes (bad luck!), and my phone, the case, and the mount were all 100% unharmed. In one of those crashes I lost front-wheel traction in the rain, got my handlebars all flipped around, and slid out. My handlebar mirror was smashed, and so was my knee, but my phone was just sitting there in the mount, good as new. The second of those crashes was even worse, and I ended up in the hospital with nasty injuries, but again, the phone was just sitting there on my handlebars like nothing had ever happened.
While riding my motorcycle, I quickly decided I needed a better way to navigate through the crazy city around me. Aleady having the lifeproof case (military makes this nearly necessary) I dec ided to try this product out. This is by far one of the best investments I've made to date. The mount comes with different sizes of rubber to allow a multitude of fittings and has multiple clamping positions. I've ridden for 4 hours at 70 mph speeds and the mount didn't move an inch. The best part was, with the ball tightened down, neither did the phone. Excellent purchase and highly recommended.
This is a great high quality mount. Have had this on my bike on some moderate trails and it was secure the whole time. It is one of the only mounts I know that allow you to have a (their) case on while it is mounted. Great build quality, worth every penny.
What they fail to mention is that for $40.00 you only get the holder but also need to purchase their own special case for your phone. Should have been a bit clearer on that so back it goes.
Looks very attractive and is made of solid material. But after about a month the outer design decorative material is now peeling off from several spots. This has been on my wife's phone and hasn't been treated harshly. Its never gotten wet and nobody tries to pick off the "taped" on design material. Piece of junk.
Like the case and love that it is waterproof. I have tried it under water. It works but still makes me nervous to put it in water. Bought it with reward certificates. I don't think I would have paid the full price for it.
This case has been so much fun. First I tested it underwater without the phone inside (warranty requirement) then the fun began. "Accidentally" dropping into water around friends gets great reactions. Taken some pictures underwater (a few inches) and they are great. This case slips easily in and out of your pocket. The only complaint is the headphone jack. You have to have an adapter to plug your headphones in, but this is due to the case being water proof, so I can live with it. After a bike ride or run, I just rinse the phone off under the tap and it's cleaned right up. This is a great case for your iphone.
I had 2 Otter Box cases previous for my iPhone. I am prone to drop my phones and didn't want to take the chance with such a fragile phone like the iPhone. The Otter Box, although very protective, doesn't last long. The rubber stretches out within 2 months. A friend recommended the LifeProof and I haven't looked back. I've dropped my phone a handful of times and nothing is wrong. I haven't droped it in water or anything like that but after doing the test the video said to do I am certain my phone will be protected. I like that it isn't bulky like the Otter Box. I wish a belt clip was included but still would recommend it highly.
I recently purchased a lifeproof case took it in the pool completely screwed on and ready, blew out speakers and flash on camera wont turn on
This case provides excellent protection - waterproof, dustproof. The only drawback is the 'door' to the charging port; if it opened just a tiny bit more it would be easier to connect and disconnect the charging cord. But I would still recommend spending the extra dollars on this case over the other available options.
I love the size and weight of this case. After 2 days I had to rip the seal off of the ear speaker so I could hear people. Also, using the speaker phone is useless as no one can understand you because of the seal. I understand this is protected for water but if I can't take a phone call where I can hear people what is the point? The charger slot is SUPER tight! Even my apple charger for my ipad is too big. None of my after market charger work, only the apple iphone charger works and it is still very tight to remove the charger. I do still like the case, sad I had to remove a seal on the phone though. I emailed the company today so I will followup if they contact me.
For people who think that this case is too expensive, stop and think about this case compared to others. The Apple Bumper Case, half the price as this case that breaks within a few months. The LifeProof feels almost just like the bumper case with just a lithe back cover. Also, this is WATERPROOF! Do you know all the opportunities this will open up for the average iPhone user? I have brought this thing in the pool, lake and river. I used a bluetooth sound system at the river and could change songs with out the worry of my iPhone getting wet. You can play music through your iPhone speakers which sounds louder than normal, and then bring it under water, where the water amplifies the sound even more! You can also bring this in the shower and do what ever you'd like, if you know what I mean. Overall spending $70 on this is definitely worth it because it will probably last about 5 years.
I'm reviewing this after having the case for 6 months. It's the summer and you now want to use this case in the water. Don't risk it. The case is very fragile when it comes to water. The most common flaw with this case is the speaker membranes not the o-ring that wraps around the whole phone backing. Believe me, it happened to me. I'm not gonna lie the case works in the water, but you have to follow the Lifeproof rules and the average person is not going to bother after the first test. Before using the case, it must be water tested. Before going in the water, it must be tested. I did not test before going into the water. It turned out there was a tiny hole in the ear piece membrane that allowed water to infiltrate. The first sign was fog in the lens and then water behind the screen protector. Then I started seeing fog in the actual iPhone lens and the water actually completed the circuit to the led light to where the light was on even when the power was turned off. My phone was still functional till it got to the backlit of the screen. The screen worked but not the light and now I think it's finished. No response in iTunes. Luckily it was the iPhone 4S and I had Apple Care + which will cover accidental liquid damage for a fee of $50. I only get two replacements. If you really want to take your iPhone in the water, your best bet is to Liquipel the phone and use this case. You have two times the protection. On the bright side, this case protects your phone from drops. It's much sleeker than Otterbox. If you buy this case with your phone, your phone will be well preserved and when you want to sell it, the exterior will be in mint condition. You also wont have to worry about the rain or getting splashed on. There is some downside. You can't use old iPhone chargers and third party chargers. The headphone jack is annoying and you can't use iHome. You have to get rid of your old screen protector. If you want no hassle, just Liquipel the phone and get an Otterbox and don't take it underwater at all. Get a Go Pro.
I don't have to worry about dropping my iPhone or getting it wet - my new Lifeproof case has it protected.
I wanted something to protect my phone without the bulk of the Otter; Lifeproof fit the bill. However, I have to remove the case if the audio system I use only has an iPod/iPhone jack/connection :((. I purchased extra connectors and replacement caps so that I could have one in the car and at work (I teach group fitness) as well as on the earphones that I use at home.
It is strange that I question the durability of a case named Lifeproof. The screen protector is good but there is a lot of glare but it does the job well. The speakers still work as does the microphone. For being a waterproof case the bulk is less than some regular cases and that is the main reason I bought it. There are however a couple of major chinks in the Lifeproof case. The first being the headphone adapter. The thing is so flimsy and loses connection with the iPhone easily. It would be nice to have a smaller more ridged one available. The second is where mine failed, the dock flap. How mine failed is beyond me, I noticed it after waking up when I pulled the charger out of the base I felt a crack when clicking the flap back in place. I had not dropped it or stepped on it so I have no idea how this could have broken but now that it is cracked all the way through this case is no longer water proof and is for all intents and purposes a bad screen protector and an annoyance if I use headphones. This case was purchased so that I wouldn't need to replace the cheap ones so I didn't mind the price. Now I have to spend 30 bucks for a replacement back piece. I also had to purchase the dock extender to work with my stereo.
this is the best case that i have ever used and will probably ever use again. before this case i have been really close to ruining my phone when i was using my (otter box defender). i have spilled stuff near the phone, gotten water on it and finally most of all dropping it. the otter box is good for protecting against dropping but not water so when my old case broke from general wear i had to make the decision on what case to get. as soon as you touch this case you can feel a real difference its not bulky it hugs the phone, so with anyone who hates to put case on their phones cause their bulky heres the answer to that. final the main feature of the phone case is water proofing and i was a little like i don't think it really is going to work however straight from the box (after reading instal papers a must) i dropped it into water and was shocked it really works my phone survived. also drop protection works to.
I tested it by dropping it in a cooler full of ice and water. Left it there for to minutes, then called. It worked just fine.
- very easy to install - keeps the phone pristine - still takes good pictures. - need to buy a dock extender because most plugs beyond the OEM plug won't work with the case
As soon as a I saw the lifeproof case I immediately bought it. Who wouldn't want a, no pun intended, life proof case? Well the first day I bought it I accidently dropped my phone from about chest height and, the case broke. I then got another and noticed that the sound quality was terrible and the phone speaker wasmuffled heavily. It was waterproof, I put it in a bowl of water and submerge it and my phone was fine. Also, there is a noticeable gap between the screen protector and the screen itself which took away from the responsiveness of the touch screen. I have since returned it and moved on to an Otterbox defender and removed the screen protector and replaced it with a Zagg cover.
I like this product, will continue to use it because it takes away the fear of dropping your iphone, getting it wet, or scratching the screen or back. In other words, it can truly take a beating in this case. However, not surprisingly, it makes the phone rather bulky, and the rubber rim makes it especially hard to get your phone out of your pocket when someone's calling you. The most annoying part, however, is that the clear protective screen, after about a week of use, has formed what looks like an oil spot where the keypad is (where your fingers touch it the most). I've removed the phone and cleaned thoroughly, but can't get it to go away. It doesn't make the phone unusable, it's just an annoying drawback, like you've constantly got a smudge on the bottom part of your screen.
I bought one because my iphone started to rust within and apparently now the situation is solved. I think a great product maybe overpriced for what it is. Main advantage it is not bulky nor ugly like the competitors. Other small problem none of the manufacturer thought of putting a clip that would clip to women purse inside or out that would be convenient and pretty at the same time.
I highly recommend this product. Pricey, but worth it.
Yes, it is a very expensive case, but it is only 10% of the phone's retail cost. Very slim, it doesn't drag out my pockets. It is not a tacky finish like silicone based covers, but maintains a good grip. I am not prone to test limits, but I have seen an otherwise sane person throw her phone across the room. I have used it in the tub whilst soaking aching muscles Negative; the power synch port is cut exactly to fit the original Apple cord. Only one after market cord (Kuhmo) fits in to charge or synch. Since all aftermarket accessories seem to be about the same cost as original, save yourself trouble and by genuine Apple.
After having had water damage on a previous iPhone I knew full well what water damage can do to one. So, when I heard about these wonderful "everything proof" cases I figured it was cheap insurance to cough up the $80+ price for the case. After 6 months of careful use (I'm a stay at home dad, so most of the time it's sitting on a table or in my pocket) the charging port door developed a near invisible hair-line crack. While on vacation I took the phone into the water to film my son on his first time snorkeling in the Caribbean. That was all it took to fry my phone. The crack in the door allowed water into the case and that was fatal to the phone. There IS no recovery from seawater with an iPhone. So IF you buy this case be diligent to inspect it very carefully if you intend on using it around water. DO NOT just trust, as I did, that the case was the "Anywhere, Anytime" case that they advertise it to be. I'm living proof that it isn't.
My romance with the lifeproof case was short lived. Other than the novelty of telling people the case was water proof (which WAS its only useful function), there is little else to discuss. The case is poor quality and is in shambles since I purchased it months ago. You may argue that I was rough on the case, but for $80.00 you expect a product that would be able to stand up to 3 falls from waist height....it hasn't. I will be purchasing an otterbox soon. I will however miss youtubing in the shower.
I wanted a case that can keep dust and lint from my phone when carrying it in my pockets and this does that perfectly. The built-in screen shield is also perfectly clear with no noise or grain. It's like there's not even a screen protector. Since the screen shield doesn't stick to the phone's screen, you don't have to fight with air bubbles or lint between the screen and the shield. Although it gets finger prints easily, it's very easy and simple to just wipe it with warm wet paper towel since the case is water proof. Or heck, you can just use your shirt. The design is also very attractive and it's very slim. It's not much thicker than the iphone 4s itself. Unlike some users, I have no problems with sound. The lifeproof site stated the sound issue is a problem with the phone and teaches you how to solve it, though I don't know how true this is. There are a few minor problems that may affect some people: 1) The USB slot for charging is very small. My 3rd party USB chargers can't fit into it. 2) You have to unscrew the cork to plug in earphones. This is annoying if you don't use a bluetooth headset instead. 3) It's impossible to flick the mute switch while the phone is in this case. I suggest you try this case out. Keep the receipt and if you don't like it, return it for a full refund. It's easy to repackage everything.
I think the case is great and does exactly what is advertised to do but I was bummed out to find out that I wasn't able to use any aftermarket iPhone chargers because it won't fit in the flip down door. Secondly I can't use any of my aftermarket headphones except for the factory Apple headphones. Buyers beware that most of your aftermarket chargers,USB cords and headphones won't work.
I bought this for my daughter's iphone 4. Great low profile, integrated look for the phone. She has not dropped it or spilled water on it, but it does look like it is well protected. The only two cons or drawbacks are the price (costs more than average covers) and the fact that not all charging docs or cords fit with this case on. one out of my 3 recharging cords fit.
Case seems to be doing it's intended job so far, but, I am not thrilled with the clear screen cover. It's not nearly as touch sensitive as my previous protection case.
I bought a Lifeproof case in Best Buy last week. I followed all the instructions and use my phone underwater (about 1 foot deep) for video for about 15 minutes. It worked at first, then bubbles went out of the speaker hole cover. Then my iPhone 4 has problem with its flash light and it would not turn off even I completely shut down my phone. When I opened the charger cover there is water running out of it! Obviously the case did not protect my phone as it is expected. Do not believe their videos on Youtube. You are under risk on your own! They already claim they have NO liability for any property loss caused by this case, but on the package they tell you to take it to snorkeling! When I called them for the whole day there is only voice mailbox and nobody answers. One more con is: you cannot take pictures under water with this case. Because finger touch does not work in water! Only thing you can do is starting video recording before enter into water and keeping it running. Not very convenient
Everyone told me to get a otter box, but i was interested in a waterproof case. The only issue i have with this case is the flap that covers the usb port has broken off after 3 months. never dropped it. Maybe otter box is the way to go.
This is ideal for those who are paranoid about having their phone destroyed. The only downside is you would have to buy an extender to use it on a docking station or if you want to use the mirroring feature on the iPhone 4s while still having it on. The touch response can be a little hampered as well from the screen protection. This is not a case to take off and on a lot. Whats nice is that its water proof but if it dropped in deep water I am not sure it would float.
Phone dropped in the pool within 1 week of purchase. Saved me $600
I've had this case for over 3 months now and haven't looked back. Yes, its waterproof. Hands down so kick butt to be able to take this underwater and shoot video and pics. Dropped it many times.. no problems. trashed it outside. Love being able to run it under the faucet to clean it. No problems with the touch screen. Call or voice clarity is great. No problems. Like the case isn't even on. It's not bulky like other cases. Very slim for the protection that it offers your phone. This is a case where a company creates a product and knocks it outa the park. It's that good. The is the best iphone case you can get. Hands down, no if's and's or but's..
The Lifeproof case is the ULTIMATE case for the iPhone. It doesn't make the phone much bigger, yet it provides drop protection, scratch protection, and even water protection. All without affecting the sound quality or the touch screen sensitivity. Now I don't worry about my iPhone. I listen to music in the shower and even while swimming (with their water proof headphones). The only thing to look out for is to check the seals after a big drop. Oh, and a few times the raised home button got pressed while in my pocket. So just be aware of that...
Best phone cover by far!!! saved my phone many, many times! A bit pricey but worth the investment!
I have one black case and one white case. The Lifeproof case is the perfect case for everyday use, accidents, and intentional exposure to water, dust, snow, etc. The Lifeproof case is rugged, but very slim with little bulk added to the phone. My Lifeproof case has saved my phone several times already from accidental exposure to water, both at work and home, and has been used to take some great underwater pictures. Lifeproof has great, professional, and dedicated customer service and will take care of any (very few) issues that might arise during your use of their product. I love my Lifeproof case and can't wait until they come out with products to protect my other electronics as well.
Definitely worth $79.99. I decided to do the water test today (no phone inside), leaving it under water in the sink & weighed down for an hour. No water inside! The best part is now the screen cover feels a lot smoother after doing that! I've only had it for a day now, but I am already happy with it. I don't plan on EVER actually having my phone underwater since ya never know if it could leak that one time.. but I will definitely not be afraid of rain! Never drop my phones either.. Might be overdoing it with this case, but I'd rather protect it (def. from rain) now so I can sell the phone later when it's time for the iPhone 5 =) Now if only they made one with a kickstand.. maybe they could make an an attachable one =) Or I'll try to make one myself some how haha!
Just bought this case today at the Best Buy on 622 Broadway in Manhattan NY. Took a chance before researching and love it. I've had the Ballistic and the Otterbox both of which clips broke. The case themselves were good but bulky by comparison to the Lifeproof case. The Lifeproof is made of a different material than that rubber used on the aforementioned cases. WOW no lint. The waterproof feature sure puts my worries to rest. I read some of the negative comments about this case. I resolved as follows: Oil slick under protector- shake a container of baby powder, turn screen protector upside down, hold above open bottle, squeeze, fine mist = no oil slick. As for the headphone issue I use the Rocketfish RF-MAB2 bluetooth headphones. Excellent sound with a built in mic to answer calls (love these). The only complaint I have was that at the Best Buy on 622 Broadway I was followed around like a criminal buy what i assume was a store investigator. I know a certain amount of footwork is necessary in that profession but this person crossed the line. Time for some retraining. Really wanted to leave but i needed the case.
I have had the iphone 4 for only 2 weeks, but knew that I needed some really great protection for it. It fell in the sink the first day, then on the floor 2 days later, and it was put on the counter in a puddle twice. I did a lot of research and went to Best Buy after reading all the reviews and bought the Lifeproof cover after reading VERY positive reviews on it. NO problem getting used to the new plastic cover at all! It was $79.99, but to me, was better than paying insurance on it. The cover is light and looks nice, I think : ) I love this cover so far. I have NO complaints at all!
I purchased this case because I wanted to see how a slimmer box cover would be compared to Otterbox which I have been using for years! First impression I think it is a pretty cool design concept! Yes it is totally water proof but I myself do not plan on taking my expensive piece of technology into water! My biggest problem with the case was the screen cover! I cleaned my phone and case before I placed it in like the directions said to do! After doing so I noticed and oily spot! So I pressed around on the screen cover and it disapeared. Then after a while of using my iPhone like I usually do it came up again! So I decided to open the case and take my phone out and clean it again! Note in the directions it says the case is not made to be opened more than 50 times! So this was the second time opening it because you are instructed to do a water test before you even put the phone in! After cleaning my phone and case a second time the same oily spot came up! If your the type person that things like that don't bother you then you should have no problem with this case! But if you are like me then I say do not get this case! I returned mine and got the new Otterbox Realtree Camo case! To me bulky is well worth knowing my phone is protected over a slimmer case!
product speaks for itself ! Indestructible! and FULL GUARANTEE !!!
THis is a great concept, but really a pain to use. You need a special cord with a small adapter. A regular cord won't work. To make it truly waterproof, you need to keep an ear phone adapter screwed in all the time. This means you have this wobbly thing plugged that is very awkward when you use it as a phone. I would return mine if I could.
Great case It feels good in your hand and is nice and slim. Only complaint is the sound quality is a bit muffled I believe you lose about 20% loss of volume. I guess this is due to being completely waterproof. I have yet to take mine for a Swim but have washed it off in the sink. Facebook feedback is truly telling with lots of product failure due to being a new start up company. I would recommend. White is awesome and of it gets dirty can be washed. Great concept and would recommend. Hope the company fixes the glitches for the future customers. Had to return my first one due to speaker being broken. Second one fine. Touch screen works gr8
This purchase was actually a Christmas gift for my boss. My daughter has one and showed it to me and I immediately knew it would be a great gift for him. I want one for myself but I don't yet have the 4 and it's not made for others yet. With my daughters, I watched as she dropped it in a glass of water and left it there for 10 minutes with no damage to the phone. Then she let her 15-month old throw it around to show me. Amazing! I'm already on the list to have one for the iPad when it comes out as a gift for my Dad.
I am a mother of four and I have been pretty hard on past phones so when I got the new iPhone 4s I knew I needed something that could protect it well. We were planning a trip to the Florida Keys and when I saw this case it seemed the perfect fit. $80 seemed a bit steep for a phone case but I justified it by the fact I could take it on the dive boat, to the pool and also the beach without fear of it getting damaged by water and sand. I now have a phone, camcorder and camera all in one that is protected. I wasn't taking any chances so I followed all the steps on the website. I am sure glad I did as there was a small hole in the cover near the microphone. Took it back to Best Buy and they replaced it without a problem. This case has already proven itself. At one point on the trip it ended up in a trash can. Found it and just washed it off! It has also been dropped a few times. I took it in the pool and got some great pictures and videos of the kids. No worries for the summer at swim team practice. Now they just to hurry up and release one for my iPad to protect it from the kids!
Purchased for my daughter on Black Friday weekend. She used it about 3 weeks before is started making her Apple iPhone 4 overheat and turn off. She also lost the headphone jack cover (i.e. screw). Best Buy does not carry replacements. Only place to order was on the LifeProof web site. Had to order 3 at a cost of about $5 each.
Love this because it's obvious I have a white iPhone. I didn't want to cover the color of my phone but I wanted to protect it. Love that it's waterproof because I have dropped past phones in water.
I got this to protect my Iphone from the same fate that my EVO 4G suffered. A cracked screen. This is VERY good protection. However you cant but this phone on a dock because of the bottom. Maybe makes some sort of extension. Also my rocket fish car charger plug wouldnt fit and I had to chop off the plastic of the rocket fish to make it work.
This is, by far, the best case for active people! I am a coach, so I constantly have my phone on me outside. I have had this is rain and shine, wind and cold, and it hasn't failed me. The only issue I had was the charging cover got a crack in it, but I messaged the company directly, and they are sending a new back for my phone to fix the problem. 3 e-mails, and the issue was solved. Not a lot of companies provide that kind of customer service.
This case is pretty awesome...but having to use the dongle to insert the headphones is a bit of a pain. And the case prevents the use of any dock.
I love the Lifeproof Case, but the inside cover can be VERY easily scratched, so be careful when you are trying to get the dust off the inside when you are installing the thing. The outside seems really strong and scratch proof. They do have a long drawn out process to make sure it is waterproof, but I really didn't plan on swimming with or showering with my phone just need the occasional splash protection. It is a pretty strong case, and lightweight!!! Good buy!! A little pricey is why I put it lower on the rating..
They need to make the next Lifeproof case with wider headphone and charger openings to fit aftermarket accessories. OEM charger and earbuds fit fine but not all aftermarket headphones and chargers fit. My Griffin car charger and Skullcandy ear buds do not plug in to the phone with the case on. There is a headphone adapter that comes with the case but is very annoying to take everywhere. Minus one star for headphone capatibility and minus another star for charger compatibility. Almost there Lifeproof, work those kinks out.
Charging is a pain. I can not use the chargers with the thicker connection interface. The fact that you have to use the audio connection supplied to use headphones is inconvenient. I find myself having to open the case to do these things which defeats the purpose.
They claim you can drop it from a distance of up to 2 meters....I don't plan on doing that. However, I am fully aware of the exorbitant cost of a new iphone when you are not getting the new contract price and it's fully worth it to protect your phone which is glass front and back (i don't agree with that design).
Two weeks ago I would have given this product five stars. As someone who is really rough with phones, it protected my iPhone against falls, coffee spills and even a bad incident where a leaking to-go box of food drenched the case in fish sauce. The phone was fine. I especially loved being able to use it in the pouring rain. However, after less then four months, the adapter for the headset (which you have to screw in to the top of the case) broke. Unless I held the adapter a specific way, I could not hear my music nor could people hear me when I was on a phone call. A new adapter is $20. Total bummer because I love everything else about the case.
When I first got the case is was a bit discouraged about the feel of the touch screen. My IP4S didn't feel right anymore. But after a few days I got use to the extra force one must do to operate the phone, and now I can barely tell. As for some reviewer saying the charger doesn't fit, this is not true for my case. Yes, no aftermarket charger I've used fits into the case, but the one that comes with the iPhone works perfect. The speaker sound from the case does sound a bit murky, my solution to his is just open the flip cover for the charger (if your just sitting in work desk and not worried about the surrounding elements hurting your iPhone# and the sound is almost as good as without the case #ALMOST#. After about a month with the case I can tell you that I didn't notice any of the inconveniences I first had when getting the case. The LIFREPRROF case has been on my iPhone since the day I bought it, and hasn't been removed since. #Accessories worth mentioning that work excellent with my iPhone is (A# the Sony MW-600 Bluetooth earphones. Now with the new Bluetooth profile, the song playing or the person calling is displayed on the tiny led screen of the unit. #B)The Bose Sound link though a bit expensive sounds pretty amazing for such a small unit)
I just upgraded form the iPhone 3G, and I was so excited to get the 4s. I definitely wanted something that would protect my new phone. I am more than happy with my decision to purchase this case. It is very slim (compared to otter box) and it is very solid. It was a very nice and secure fit on my phone, and I love that it is completely waterproof. I love the fact that it doesn't grip your pants when you put your phone in your pocket. I've had other cases in the past that would do that, but this one doesn't. I would recommend this to anyone! Especially those that live very active outdoor lives, or are around children a lot. It gives me the peace of mind, and I'm sure it will give you the same :D
Ok, so I am not going to try and sell you on this case. But I must say that for the money it offers you peace of mind. The case is very slimming and looks great. If you are also like me and have the iphone in black and always wanted it in white the case looks even more amazing. I have the Iphone 4s and the case is a snug fit and looks great. The screen protecter is not flush all the way to the screen and so yes you do have to hit the screen s little bit more harder. I mean very little. In a few days with the case you will not even realize it. The water proof feature does work. I have taken calls in the shower and text as well in water. I would not fully recomend taking the case diving when on vacation but if you drop your phone in a puddle or spill a drink on it, rest assured your phone will be unharmed. If you are on the fence about spending the $80, I say it is worth it knowing that your phone is protected from just about any reasonable thing besides a car running over it. PS the sound reduction is really not bad to any person that is not always watching a movie off there iphone with the speaker.
I did a lot of research before purchasing this case. Having used Otterbox cases for my phones, I had a particular standard and expectation about how a case should protect. The two things that appealed to me the most about LifeProof was its waterproofing and slim form factor features. After watching all of the videos, reading the forums and trying out the case myself, here's my verdict: the case is very impressive. It completely lives up to its claims about making the iPhone waterproof and shock proof (can't wait for snowboard season to test the snow proof). For the first few days, I loved scaring people by "accidentally" dropping the phone into water. The other thing I really like is how truly thin it keeps the phone. My wife still uses the Otterbox for her iPhone 3GS and it's twice the size. While it does add about 1/3 of an extra inch in length it hasn't really bothered me. What I do have issue with is that the screen interface and sensitivity is reduced a little bit. For the most part, it's been ok but I do have to make a few extra tap attempts when needing to press around the edges of the screen. This has been the biggest point of contention for the LifeProof's critics, so it really becomes a subjective assessment for each individual. For me, I can live with it because the benefits outweigh this particular concern. The other small issues are the buttons. Interestingly, the case covers all of the buttons, affecting each of them differently. The main menu button actually becomes more sensitive which has accidentally turned the phone on when in my pocket. The power button has become a little more difficult to press and the way they designed the covering of the audio select switch causes it to work in the reverse (push up to mute and down for sound). Again, all of these are a small compromise for everything else this case provides. I recently had to use my SquareTrade warranty for my iPad2 when the screen cracked. This caused me to think about purchasing a warranty for my iPhone, but honestly, I think LifeProof may be all of the added protection I need. my advice, if you need a truly minimalist experience with a phone case, leaving the screen and buttons unaffected or hindered then this case may not be for you. If you are really looking for solid protection and are ok with using bulky cases like the Otterbox than the LifeProof case is definitely worth checking out.
I have used this case for a while now, and while I understand the few complaints such as cable compatibility and screen cover not fitting tightly, these are very minor compared to the level of protection it provides. Even while offering unparalleled protection it remains extremely thin and stylish. This thing is cool. In my opinion it matches the iPhone 4s itself in quality and innovation. I have absolutely no affiliation with Lifeproof, I'm just a very picky consumer who insists on near perfection. This case comes close to that standard. I have given it only 4 stars until I see how it holds up over time, but so far, I believe this is easily the best tough case and perhaps the best case period!
At first glance this case seemed like it would solve all of my problems. I received the case today. It looks and feels kind of cheap. The screen protector doesn't sit well on the phone (did all the tricks to fix that) . There is a "bezel" on the backside of the proximity sensor that makes the protector separate from the phone screen. Also, visibility is greatly reduced because the screen protector is so shiny. Outside it's nearly impossible to see the screen, even with the brightness turned all the way up. The speaker output is greatly reduced, more so than anyone let on. I had a very hard time hearing my brand new loud iPhone 4s. For me, that is a deal breaker in itself. Charging the phone while in the case is also difficult. I ordered a dock extender (from Amazon b/c life proof was out of them) and it didn't fit. The door that you must open to charge/sync is in the way, even when fully opened. The fact that you need to take a dock extender everywhere you go, if you want to charge your phone is too much hassle. I really wanted to like this case. But for everyday college use, it's not for me. There are too many inconveniences for me. In my opinion, it would be great for a camping/hiking trip. I'll be returning mine and searching for something else. ]
I' so happy with this case, it save my iPhone® 4..it fold down in 10 "of water nothing happened is the best money spent to protect my iPhone® 4....
This case is great if you are using it for sports that involve elements you need to protect your phone from, ie. water. I only gave it three stars based on the reduced screen sensitivity with this case, the difficulty hearing a caller and the caller hearing me, and the size of the case. This may have been the sleekest case at one time but the Otterbox Reflex line is the exact same thickness as the LifeProof case and it is not as long. I can't figure out where the extra length is coming from on the LifeProof case but it makes it harder for smaller hands to hold and text comfortably with.
I first read about the LifeProof case on a tech blog. For about 2 weeks I repeatedly went to the product website and debated on spending the money, especially with a new iPhone coming out. I was worried about spending so much money on a case that might be "obsolete" within weeks. I went ahead and purchased the case directly from the LifeProof website and when it came I went right to work, testing the case empty underwater. It worked perfectly. I was a few days into using my case when several people commented that when in a phone call I sounded distant. I went and looked up this issue online and it was noted that sometimes there is a small flaw with the membrane covering the microphone which doesn't allow sufficient vibrations to transmit sound. I contacted the manufacturer and they replaced my case with the Gen 2 case. Now the case works flawlessly, both for the watertight/drops and the sound quality. Overall, I HIGHLY recommend this case, especially if you're someone who doesn't purchase AppleCare for your phones. The case is expensive, but it may save you much more money in the end!
This case was the end to my search for the perfect case. I wanted a slim case that didn't add much bulk to the phone, was waterproof and drop proof. This was it! Other cases had some of the features but none had all. This case allows you to use all the buttons on your phone, you can charge the phone in the case with the original apple cable (others may not fit but they do have the Radtech adapter to use any cable or dock you may have) the screen is perfect either right out the box or after a short break-in period (it can take a few days to flatten upon initial install. When I opened the box initially I was a little surprised, the case felt so light and almost flimsy, no way this could do everything they say. After you put in on it transforms into a sturdy and attractive cover. I used to be a fanatic about always putting my phone back in a holster in fear of dropping it and carrying ziplock bags around to keep it from getting wet. No more! I stuff my phone in my pockets now, fear no rain, use it in hot tubs, spill stuff on it and simply dont worry. You do have to follow their instructions to ensure waterproofness, initial water test without phone, inspect all seals before immersion, and retest after a major drop. No case will guarantee that your phone will never break, but I trust Lifeproof more than any other case. I've had a white, black and now purple one, just because I couldn't decide what color was best. Call quality is great and the case feels great in your hand. I keep a spare as I don't ever want to be without this case. On the rare occasion I take the case off I'm sure I'll break my phone and worry until I put it back on. I've had these cases for 4 months now and they still look brand new. No scratches on the screen, I do clean it with a damp cloth or just detergent and water in a sink. Dry increases the risk of scratches. Try it! You'll love it.
As an iPhone 4 user I've gone through so many cases only to be disappointed and would continue my search for that perfect case. That search stops here with the LifeProof case... No more wasting money on cases for me, this is truly the end all of searching since I found this case and company. Who doesnt want a mil spec case that is really waterproof, shockproof, dirtproof, and snowproof? I've had my case for awhile and have nothing but high remarks for this product and company. Excellent/innovative/magnificent thin design and access to all the buttons and charge port without removing the case, can't beat that, I honestly can't wait to see what this company has in store for us next, I'll be a LifeProof'er for life! So what are you waiting for? Ditch those other wannabe cases and get a LifeProof. Let's Go!
I love it it's hot and it keeps your phone safe ! Water snow dirt drop it whatever and your phone will still work and look great ! This case kicks other case to the curb ! Must have
I have this case in white and my husband has black we love them! He is on the swat and dive team at the pd and the phone has held up threw all kinds of thing it's sleek light weight and works great we love it life with out iPhone in a Lifeproof case is so much more fun and relaxed not having to worrie
When I bought this case I thought, why test the case for waterproof-ness if I never would trust it enought to put my phone under water in it!? I never did test the case for waterproof-ness as the directions instruct. I knew I would never trust it that far. That is a risk I just would never take. I like the case though, I hang out at the beach alot and would NOT be afraid if it got splashed or dropped into the sand. I wouldn't be fearful if it dropped from my person while riding my bike either. I took it out of the case for a few days, but worried about droppoing it everywhere I went; then put it back in. I think I use the blutooth feature alot so I am not so worried about the sound quality but it seems fine to me. I think it's probably overpriced and it would pay to shop around. I see from other reviews that my gut not trusting the waterproof-ness is probably valid. Good case... good value... maybe, but lower your expectations when it comes to waterproof, just buy an underwater camera... The belt clip comes in handy too.
I was a little concerned when purchasing this whether it would affect being able to hear during a phone conversation, or listening to music considering it is completely enclosed. Very pleasantly surprised to find that it doesn't affect anything at all. I work in a rather dirty environment and chose white to match the phone- it cleans off really easily, just something to keep in mind if you are not sure of what color to choose. I feel that my phone is VERY well protected and am very happy with my purchase
Overall this case is AMAZING!! I have tried the phone underwater and it still works perfectly! Case is very durable, I have dropped my phone a few times already and it still works great with no disruption--I took the phone out of the case and still no scratches or water damage--its awesome!
Very rugged case, handles all the outdoor situations a summer director and father of 3 can throw at it. Slim and easy to grip. Only major gripe is need for headset adapter. Seems they could built adapter into case. Otherwise all around best case I've had for any iPhone. Highly recommend.
I would not recommend buying the waterproof cover by LifeProof for the iPhone. LifeProof, AT&T (who sold it to us) or Apple do not cover the phone getting water damage from the case (yes we tested it for 24 hours beforehand and registered it). AT&T says they did not realize this when they sold the case to us less than a month ago, when they told us LifeProof would cover any damage. IF SOMETHING SOUNDS TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE, IT PROBABLY IS.
Decided to buy a Lifeproof case a couple of days ago. So far its been one of the best cases I've own! I use to be very careful with my phone up until a month ago when I just started dropping it constantly. After two cases, I decided to go with this one and see what the fuss was all about! First of all, its very slim and very lightweight. Probably one of the lightest cases I've own. It lives up to the claim of being waterproof as I left my phone submerged for a few minutes with a video playing and nothing happened! I can even drop this phone and no damaged to the phone at all! One thing I was really worried about is the video quality. Luckily, the built-in screen protector actually helps retain the visual acuity of the retina display. Only complaints I have about the case is that I can only use my original apple cable for charging so it loses all functionality within my car! And of course you can not dock the phone with this case, but then again, any case I've own in the past that was worth anything also ran into that problem. It just one of those tradeoffs. Overall, I'm very pleased with this case! If you are looking for something to protect you phone and not be as bulky as an Otterbox, this is the phone case to go with!
Watched their instructional video, walked through their instructions (including holding the case under water for 30 minutes before putting on iphone), never took the phone below 3 feet of water. After two weeks the case leaked, soaking my iphone. Left my iphone in a bowl of rice for three days. It works, but is unresponsive sometimes, home button has problems, and warranty is void. Many people love the case and have rated it very high. LifeProof must have quality control issues because a lot of people have complained about the case leaking. LifeProof needs to address the lack of quality control and respond to all of those of us who have lost hundreds of dollars because the LifeProof Case failed to deliver on the company's guaranty.
I purchased this case with my new iPhone. Did everything as per instructional video and did the water test for two hours. Installed the phone and never opened it till yesterday. After a day on the beach, where I used the phone to take some videos and pictures returned to the hotel and discovered that the phone is not working. Carefully opened the case and discovered that there were some moisture inside and the phone is dead. I think the case is nice but it is not waterproof as advertised. It can handle a light splash of water or wet hands. But not more than that.
I took it under water and by the time I got it out of the water there was water inside the case. So now my phone won't play music throw the speaker and the home bottom sticks also it's hard to turn the phone off and on with the case on anyway. Don't buy the case! It says water proof but it's not!
I bought this case primarily for use in pools as a way to take photos underwater during family vacation. After having this case for a month, I took it into the hotel's pool for photos. When I got out of the pool, the bottom of the case had water in it. It had enough to keep my phone working but ruin the speaker so it no longer rings or makes any sound whatsoever. The mesh looking protector that covered my bottom speaker leaked water into the case and I now have to pay for a new phone since I do not have apple care. Lifeproof also does not guarantee that their product works. They also do not have anything to back their product up butnto only replace the case. What good does that do with a ruined phone!! DO NOT GET THIS CASE!!!!!
OK, based on their claims on their packaging - you can take this thing swimming, snorkeling, etc. Thats true, as long as you don't mind destroying your phone when it leaks. We bought one, and it did leak when we took it into the pool, about 6 inches underwater. (And yes, we did follow the installation instructions exactly). When we called Life Proof - they said they would guarantee just the case, and send us a new one, but wouldn't offer anything for the damage this case did to the IPhone! It cost me $200 to get the phone replaced. Their claims give you a very false sense of security. Do NOT expect this case to protect your phone!!!
I liked the case ok but don't buy this product if you think you will ever need customer support or to enforce the warranty. If you are ever able to actually get a response from customer service the procedures they put you through to file a warranty claim are outrageous. After hours of trying to file a claim I just gave up and bought a competitor's case. Needless to say, neither I nor any of my family or my associates will ever buy a product from this company again. Look elsewhere!
Great product. Well built, durable, and water tight.
After getting caught in a rainstorm outside and having to pony up $50 for a new iPhone 4s with Applecare Plus, I decided to give this case a try. It IS waterproof, and easy to put on the phone. It's expensive, and only comes with an adapter for wired headsets, and the adapter limits their functionality. Press the button to pull up Siri or answer a call? Not with the included adapter. The membrane does let some sound in while keeping water out, but you'll either have to use it with a wired or preferably a good bluetooth headset, or you'll be yelling at your handset for people to hear you. What really galls me is that despite paying $80, you still have to pay $30 for a belt clip and another $30 for a 30 pin adapter to use with your existing dock devices, or any charger than the original Apple white usb connector. So, for $140 plus tax you can also get your phone replaced three times through the applecare plus warranty. I guess their philosophy and business model is that consumers of Apple products don't mind getting price gouged for added functionality. These accessories should either be included with the case or their prices should be halved. I'd love to love this product, but with it's functionality, price and accessory pricing, I'd only recommend it if you worked as a dolphin trainer at Seaworld or stupidly didn't get the Applecare Plus warranty when you bought your phone.
My iPhone was less than 30 days old and I never drop or damage my phone. One day I removed the case for cleaning and my phone was cracked! Big cracks! All over the back. I probably dropped the phone less than 3 times and from no more than waste high. Nothing even significant I can remember. I could not believe it was cracked after all the reviews and hype. $80 and it breaks within 30 days and NO rigorous treatment. Junk. I returned it. Also, the screen is protected by a thick plastic covering which is more rubbery feeling than the otter box so you have to really press Te buttons hard to type. Totally annoying, and totally not worth it. Also, the ports for music/headphones and charging are really sealed well for waterproofing so charging is sometimes a headache and some charger won't fit. Music ports require an adapter that is included but inconvenient. Without the adapter you have to remove the case to plug headphones or aux cable in car. Stick with otter box. Don't waste your time or money.
We have one for both mine and my wife's phones. Piece of mind. I use my phone during search and rescue operations and its nice not having to worry about rain and snow. I have dropped it several times inside, on pavement and concrete with only a few scratches on the case. I have not dunked it in water, just don't see the need, but I don't worry about it getting splashed or rained on. They have one now for the ipod so my son wants one for Christmas. I am even waiting to get the iphone 5 until they come up with the case for it.
I purchased this case in Aug and in Sept the phone got wet and now my white iPhone 4S is damaged and LifeProof has refused to cover my device, all they can do is send me another case for a broken phone. My advice is DO NOT TRY TO GET THIS CASE WET, it will destroy your device and they will not replace it. Per my phone carrier they are supposed to cover my device but they won't.
The new 4s features SIRI that is very helpful when driving. It supports messaging, dialing and email responses without user looking at phone. I love this phone.
This is not a 4G phone. Apple openly states this. However, AT&T continues to say that it is a 4G device. The device is great. I would recommend that you do not get into contracts with AT&T. Thier advertisments are extremly misleading. Do your homework.
I had the iphone4 before this phone. This new phone is very cumbersome because i have to charge this phone twice a day. When i first got this phone i had to charge it all the time it seems and did not have this problem with my iphone4. This phone also has to be reset every couple of months and i have to clear out my cookies and history in my web browser because my 3G stops working. I don't know if i got a faulty phone, but this does not stack up to my iphone4. Such a rip to pay $400 for a downgrade! This phone does however have a great camera, but i expected the front camera to be better as well and i can't tell the difference. Siri is also kind of a mystery to me because there was an app for siri. The program still misunderstands me quite often and i think using it to text (while driving) is more dangerous than just texting because you have to read to make sure that siri got it right. Waste o f a program in my opinion.
You pay for what you get. The iPhone is the best smartphone on the market, bottom line. I've owned every iPhone since it's inception, not one problem with the device. 64GB is needed if you have a lot of media and things of that nature. Only thing I'd recommend is getting a case, dropped the thing 4 times. It's glass-like texture makes it really easy to slide off surfaces.
Definitely worth the upgrade from my 4.... Dual processors make a notable difference and Siri is awesome!!!
This phone is great...I can agree with some of the other reviewers about the battery life seeming short, but other than that, it's great! I've been an Apple fan for years...I had an iPhone 4 & sold it to get the 4s...in the interim, I borrowed a smart phone from a friend and found out quickly how much more user friendly the iPhone is...it's very intuitive. The other phone was extremely frustrating, I was so happy to get the 4s. Like I said, it's Apple...need I say more.
The best smartphone available, whether you want an app loaded powerful task completing, personal information manager, music/media provider and great gaming device or just a very simple phone that anyone can figure out how to use. The iPhone is your phone.
I upgraded from the iPhone 4. Was disappointed that it wasn't the iPhone 5 that we all anticipated, but once again, Apple has a hit on its hands. Siri is great. Like having a personal assistant at your disposal 24/7. I also noticed the increase in speed over the 4 and am so glad that the battery/grip of death issues have been addressed. Not to mention that the 8 MP camera and HD video have eliminated the use of my stand alone camera and video devices. Apple customer for life!
Love the speed, love everything about iPhone 4s Love how easy it is to work it or find something on it...
Best phone, I don't know why I left ! This phone works hard! Camera is excellent.
Im an Apple fan and I do love my iPhone. The only thing that is not working for me is the battery life. My previous phone lasted all day. This one I have to have a charger close.
My iPhone 4S Is the epitome of how a cell phone should operate. It has an incredible camera, the Siri is a time saver, and it is significantly faster than iPhone 4 in daily use case scenarios.
This little gem of a phone is zippy. I never have lag like I did on my 4s. No dropped calls ever in the 2 months I've had it. Don't use Siri much but I do use the speech to text recognition features within the email and text. My iphone 4 friends are insanely jealous over that feature!!
this is the only mobile phone they should sell on the entire planet. apple makes the best consumer electronics on the planet
I like the design of the phone. Apps open quickly and videos look great streaming over home WiFi. Siri is helpful for the times you are not able to type. I'm grateful for the larger memory capacity.
I have to say the the 4s is great!! i had an issue with "Siri" fading in an out in between operation. The battery life is an issue I hope will eventually be resolved. The internet browsing is pretty awesome. The camera takes great pictures. There are allot of little upgrades that were made that were bothersome in the past that make you say "cool, i hated that..." I was comtemplating buying the 16 gb model and I have to tell you that im glad i didnt, i already used up 15gb on my 64 already!! Love the Iphone 4s...
Thus far I've had great experience with the 4GS. Calls don't drop, faster speed is obvious, the voice recognition is excellent and available for most apps to use. Who says you can't text while you drive!! The photo quality is terrific. Whereas the 3GS showed me a "battery low" warning every morning, this doesn't. Really have no negatives. Plus the Best Buy purchase experience was very pleasurable.
I really like this case for my iphone. I was surprised that the case has a velvety feel to it; not hard plastic feel This holster lets you face the phone in or out. The holster has a velvet lining inside for extra protection. My sister is going to get one.
This was a gift from my boyfriend. I was leaning toward the new Samsung, but I don't have 4G available in my area and won't for a while, it's huge and decided to go with this iPhone. I am very happy with my choice. I did purchase the Mophie case which is not only very protective, but nearly doubles the battery life. It is worth the money, seriously.
I upgraded from my droid which kept freezing up multiple times a day and this is such a nice change, I love it. I seriously have no complaints. I had to take the battery out of my droid at least 15 times a day to get it to unfreeze especially when trying to end phone calls. Working with Best Buy was a lot easier than working with VZW, since all VZW wants to do is push the 4G droids. Another plus is that I can actually hear phone conversations, unlike the droid where I had to say what ALL the time.
I had the droid and this is must better and faster, easy to use
I can't give enough Kudo's to this phone...everything about it is great. So far, I have no complaints. I'm learning new things on it every day. I guess there is one complaint...I can't send emails out, but I think that's because of CenturyLink...I keep forgetting to contact them about this! Otherwise, I am thoroughly satisfied!
My first iPhone. Loving it! Easy to use. I text much better on this phone than any other ooh one I've had.
I got this on mothers day for my wife. She loves it and it makes perfect sense for her because she has the ipad and ipod. It synced perfectly with the apps she already bought. She uses it a lot which is probably why battery life is poor and it is constantly buzzing/chiming with updates and notices. I know this can be adjusted, but it's not a big deal to plug in for her at home or in the car She charges about 1 -2 times a day depending on use. Otherwise the phone works great and I get a kick out of Siri.
i rec'd this in the middle of May.it has never held a charge. I have to be inconvenienced and go back to the store. even if i use the mophie it takes hours and hours to regain cell life. too funny all the verizon reps say are your apps on? lights dim.. yes..nothing is on. Siri - isnt all that. i rarely use her. she does not understand much. TV makes it much more user friendly. if you call verizon about the iphone they tell you to call apple. you call apple and its a verizon problem. i am seriously disgruntled. the phone is very fragile too, of course i have it in a case.
Great phone. Can do everything from phone, camera, entertainment , tv and personal computer.
The product just works. It synced up with all my info in a snap. Love it. Really wanted the 32 gb version, but best buy doesn't carry it, or at least that was what the clerk told me at the store. I get two days out of a charge.
First time smart phone and I am very impressed. I get why everywhere you look people have the iPhone. It is the best. Don't waste your time with any other phone and get the best.
after a few short months the battery only last 4 hours on stand by bought the morphie extra battery case can barely get through the day.
I like the phone but there is so much to it and I got absolutely no instructions on how to use it. I'm sure it does so much more than I have figured out! The keypad is small and I often hit the wrong letter when texting. The auto-correct loves to change the words I am trying to type and that is very frustrating! Although I am some what disappointed in the ease of learning to use my new IPhone 4S, I do like it and I look forward to figuring out all its capabilities.
Upgraded from the iPhone4 to the iPhone 4s after dropping and breaking the 4. (It was upgrade time anyway). Came to Best Buy and was able to trade in my old phone and get my new one for far less than Verizon Wireless charges to upgrade. The sales staff was knowledgeable and taught me things about the phone that I did not know. The 4s is worth the upgrade for Siri alone. When driving, having Siri send messages or find directions is phenomenal. The camera on this phone takes better pictures than my Canon Powershot digital camera. I'm totally sold on anything Apple after having this phone (and my MacBook Pro)!
Love this phone, very easy to operate immediately upon purchase. The battery life is not that great and I have to keep the charger with me all the time. Also very disappointing that this phone was not eligible for the double data deal due to not being a 4G phone.
This is a fun phone and has so many new features that there will be a longer learning curve for those of us with fewer skills. I am still learning, but it is truly a magic device! Yes, by the time I am proficient there will be a newer device. Too bad! I'll just enjoy this one I have now for some time!
Apple should have put a larger capacity battery and a micro SD card slot.
I have had so many phones in the last 15yrs, and this is the best sounding phone for calls. I traded in an android phone for the 4s. I really love this phone. Now I know why so many iPhones have been sold.
Nice phone but you would think that since Apple updated to the 4S they would have a lot more features than Siri. A little disappointed that I spent the money to upgrade from my original 4 for the little difference.
Going back to a droid. The phone works fine but I am not a fan of the email. I prefer the touchdown app therefor I am going back to droid.
Battery life is good. Lasts me all day. Even playing games. Screen colors are crisp. I have no complaints about this phone. I came out of a Droid and am glad I made the switch!
I got this phone for one reason: the wife wanted it. Now, I'll be the first to tell you she had determined this in the space of 20 minutes playing with the store phones. Tried this phone for 15 minutes, and then the next phone for 5 minutes before switching back. iPhone in hand on the way out the store, it has seen more use than the old phone. Apps have made it more than a phone: it's communication central. She has used all features than you would expect, and not looked back.
At first I hated this iPhone - I couldn't get Siri to recognize anything I said and she just wouldn't do what I wanted her to. It is getting easier. I'm not sure the phone was worth $200, but it is fun to play games on...
I like it because I can video someone when I talk to them
I have had my iPhone for several weeks now, and I still haven't even used it to it's full potential and I LOVE it. It runs so smoothly. The ONLY complaint I have is that my email doesn't automatically update. I have to go into it before it refreshes and downloads new emails. That aside, this is a great phone. I am not one to spend a lot of money on a cell phone, but I was sick of the LGs and Samsungs - even if I took the best care of them, they had issues between 3-9 months. I was skeptical about this phone because I like to have a keyboard, but I have found texting on this phone to be just as easy. Telling Siri to remind you of things is the best feature. I work 2 jobs and am in graduate school, so I have a lot to remember and Siri helps me out. The photos it takes are also fantastic!! I love my iPhone and highly recommend it. (I also recommend getting your phone through Best Buy, of course. Their insurance plan is by far superior and they have great customer service!)
Very happy with this phone. All the apps I could want and very easy to use.
Everyone seems to have this phone.Of course the one I got was a flunky..Speakers went and the phone had to be replaced.I have only had it 2 weeks.My wife wants to get one but I dont know....Thank God I purchased the protection plan is all I can say. another person was at the store exchanging for the same problems....
Had the razr for a week and hated it. It kept having glitches. Switched and love the iPhone. If you've ever had an iPod touch you'll love the iPhone. Battery life is good if you don't have Push for every app.
I love this phone, it has everything I could possibly want for personal use. Easy to use, fun to play with, everything is at your fingertips.
Faster for everything and god for music and games app olso luck good in whith
I will never go back to any other phone! Great purchase!
Bought the 4S for my wife, next week have to take it back, head phone jack only plays out one side, I've swtiched three sets of headphone and it does it on all of them, other than they wife seems to enjoy the phone. Will see if it can be fixed or trade out
Our family has ipods, ipads, and now 2 iphones. We switched from droids because they were overall terrible and EXTREMLY slow! We are now in love with our phones and love being able to synch everything. The cloud is wonderful for pictures, too. We never have to worry about losing any, and we can always access our favorite music.
I love the phone. The negative is don't let Best Buy associates hook you up with a phone plan. I wanted to go onto my husband's plan and was told I would only be paying 30.00 data plan for me. Went to Verizon a month later and they said my plan was ridiculous. Best Buy associate put my on family plan with my husband but he had unlimited and they made my plan unlimited so both of us paid double. I wil NEVER use Best Buy again for phone plans. Best Buy cost me quite a bit of extra money! So I recommend the phone, but not Best Buy.
I held out for a long time thinking I wouldn't use the features of this phone enough to make it worth the expense. Boy was I wrong . I may not actually need to have all these features, but I love the access to the internet, the camera, and the email access. I will never be without it again.
This is my first smart phone. It's pretty easy to use and I love the apps. Tried a Droid for a few days but it was to confusing so back it went to Verizon and I went to Best Buy where they didn't try to get me to buy what they wanted. My only problems are Siri doesn't always understand what I say and the keyboard it hard at first to get used to but the positives definitely outway the negatives. Would also recommend getting a protective cover for the front screen. Makes taking care of it much easier.
I was one who was never going to go from a basic phone to a smartphone because I just didn't think the additional expense was worth it, that I wouldn't use it very much. Oh, my, Goodness, was I wrong. This phone is just perfect. It is so absolutely intuitive and easy to use. I've tried so many things without formally planning ahead to do them. I would be in the middle of something and just keep right on going. For example, I was reading a text from someone who had forwarded the phone number of someone else. On any other phone I would have thought, "Ok, get something to write this number down...", but I did't even think about it, I touched the phone number string of text in the text message and a "Copy" option popped up. So I open up the Contacts and created a new one. For the phone number, I pressed my finger to the screen again until "Paste" showed up and touched Paste. That was it. But the point is, I didn't think have to think ahead to do that or while I was doing it, I just did it because the phone makes things so natural.
This is the best phone purchase I have ever made. I know that it is more than a phone, you have a mini computer in the palm of your hands. This phone does everything I want and more. The more I use this phone the more I like it. I don't know why I did not purchase an iPhone sooner. The only thing I wish was different is the battery life, but if that is the only down fall, I can live with that.
I've had the 4s for a month now and I have no complaints. Next to friends phone with bigger screens the iphone is still so much clearer. I love that the phone is not huge, but very clear to read and navigate. The only negative part sometime is the non supported flash for some videos. I'm not super techy but I can get around as needed for other electronics just fine, but the iphone is just easy. I never had an android phone, but I had an android tablet that lasted in my household for 3 weeks and I returned it for an ipad 2, which the reason I went iphone.
Works much faster than my old 3g phone. The rep at Best Buy was great and very helpful
I love my Iphone 4S, its a great phone, best phone on the market. i had a blackberry curve and it operating system is slow as f***. at first i thought it was just the 3G thing since the 4G came out. But on my Iphone 4S, its super fast no matter where i am.
I wouldn't choose any other phone. This phone pretty much does everything that you need and let me tell you that once you have this phone you are addicted to it you wouldn't know what to do without it. It makes androids look dumb and I hate androids and would never own one. So over all this phone is a 9 out of 10 the battery could be a little better. But other then that it's supper fast.
This phone is definately scary to invest in because of the price but it is well worth it. Verizon kept giving me cheap broken phones and wouldn't help me at all. When I went into Best Buy to just buy a phone out right they didn't push me to the most expensive phone. They should me a phone that was perfect for me. This phone has no problems so far. Its perfect. The 4s is definately faster than the 4 but still pretty much the same phone. Love it! and never giving it up.
Good luck asking her that, she will turn you down. I love my iphone 4s, i have it in white, i just think the black is more masculine. I Have over 800 songs from i tunes on my phone as well as a few hundred pictures and it has a ton of more space on it. the screens are easy to move around, the internet is quick. i dont even have to type out my texts any more siri does it for me! i also love that when i dont know a phone number i tell siri to call the best buy in dekalb and it finds the number for me! i love the forward facing camera and facetime is pretty cool too. its not as customizable as i would of liked, but personally in my opinion, this is the best phone on the market!!!! I Love and i would never give it back!!
I have enjoyed having the iphone 4s. You can do so much with this phone. I like having the flexibility to make calls, take pictures, read mail and surf the web no matter where you are.
I've wanted an iPhone for the longest time and after killing my Droid I figured "What the heck". And I'm so glad I changed to the iPhone! This is the most amazing phone yet and it does everything I need it to,and more! It's incredibly easy to text & navigate. The apps are endless (as everyone knows). Not to mention, the camera is amazing for a phone! I used it at a concert and got crystal clear pictures from 16 rows back. I did have a problem with the battery life at first. After tweaking a few settings (gps, wi-fi, etc.) I don't run into any problems with it (battery lift) anymore. It lasts me almost 2 days before needing to be charged. Also, it charges wicked fast. I'm used to charging my old 20g iPod classic and it took hours to charge. The iPhone takes less than an hour to fully charge.
Bought for everyone during the holidays 3 total. The product works well no problems so far. Hard to find, Best Buy was only place i could find so i drove 90 miles to get. They set up everything before i left so i did not do anything which was great. Camera works well and streaming works well good picture. Would buy again but get a Otterbox case to protect expensive and fragile.
I love my iPhone 4s. It has so many great features. Siri is awesome it comes in really handy. The cameras take great pics and videos. Its an overall wonderful phone.
Great phone love iOS 5 and cloud integrated into iPhone . Had android phones (droid Eris, droid x, Samsung fas.) no were near the quality of this phone
Made the switch from my Droid Incredible and I'm thoroughly loving my 4s. Siri is a little dissappointing, but overall the phone is great. iOS and the hardware throttle anything that Android can deliver.
I love this phone. This is the best phone I have ever had and I thought my i-pod touch was great. The phone has so many more features. You can get so many different apps and most are cheap or free. It takes great pictures, games, puzzles, music, video's and so much more.....
I love my iphone, great internet and web access. Seri is very cool, and the speaker on the phone is great.
great service and customer at the Bloomington Indiana Mobile store in the mall. The phone is more than it was touted to be. Siri is a great "tool" to have and the battery life is supberb!!!
I purchased the iphone 4S in white about a month ago and I love everything about it. Its easy to use and has many features. Your firends will have phone envy!! I almost never use my laptop since gettig this phone. Its a mini computer. I used to have blackberry phones and got used to the touch typing in a hour.
I wasn't sure I'd like the iPhone after being a blackberry user for years. I thought I might be slowed down texting & sending email with the touch screen vs. the keyboard. The features on the iPhone 4S soon made me forget about my Blackberry. I use for both work and personal use so I like that I can access contacts, calendars & email to help keep me orgainized. The phone works well for me, I've had no issues with dropped calls. The camera takes great pictures and I love having all my music, pictures, calendar all available on my phone. Internet searching is much more functional on the iphone than I ever experienced on my Blackberry. Siri the electronic assistant is both fun and functional once you get the hang of how to speak to her, it's great for searching the internet or voice activated dialing.
Great phone. The apps are great. Camera takes awesome pics.I love having conversations with Siri ( yes I'm a teenager). The only thing is that she sometimes doesn't understand what I'm saying and gives incorrect informaton. The bad thing is the battery, it doesn't last very long if you're using apps and the phone frequently. I hope they can fix this at some point with a system upgrade.
Everything I wanted and expected, best purchase of 2011!
Best phone ever! I will never go to android again.
I love this phone. It is my first smartphone so I'm unfamiliar with how they work but this one really is so easy to use. Love the look too! My daughter dropped it on the hardwood floor and the hard case chipped. Recommend a using a case. It was easy to replace.
Great phone...of course. Easy to use and great looking.
Was time to upgrade my phone, and most my friends and family have Iphones, so I said why not. As far as the phone goes it is everything I expeted it to be. Easy to use, fun, Siri is a bit of a joke but can be entertaining. The camera's on this phone are flat out amazing for a flipping phone. My contract pricing was aviable and I had some gift cards, and this is my only issue with the phone was Best buy. The rep who were taking care of me did not know what to do, she kept asking for help, and got none from her co wokers. During the processes she actually deavtivated my wife's phone and almost terminated my contract. I ended up having to go back to the store to return the phone and rebuy it to use my gift cards, again due to the rep not knowing what to do. quick summery, phone good, best buy phone reps, garbage
I love this phone. The apps and extras are well worth the time it took to figure out how to use it. My only frustration is with the texting. It is impossible to put the cursor in between two letters to change a letter which would be useful since it frequently changes words I spelled correctly to a different word. When telling my husband I love him it changed it to I live you. It does this frequently. Other than that I love this phone. My fav so far.
i was always an adroid user but them i stopped using all the features that you get with android like the multi screens and all that other stuff.so i decided that since i was going to verizon i might as well try the iphone.and i have to say that i am very impressed.the user interface is good for me i hated ios 4 cause the notification system was awful.but ios 5 is way better even tho it is just android redifined.i love itunes and siri is awsome i love to use it while im driving so i never have to touch my phone.overall this is a good phone but it jsut depends on what kinda person u r rather u will like it or not
The phone was not available at any stores within 17 miles except for the Glendora and Riverside stores. I chose Glendora. The reviews of this store being a nightmare are true! I didn't believe it until yesterday. I ordered the iphone online, paid for it, etc... then, received notification that is was ready to be picked up. I checked my online banking and the money was already processed. Ok, the whole process of picking up my phone from start to finish was exceedingly and excruciatingly long. I got there around 3:30 and left at 5:00. Also, the mobile employee didn't care that he was entering my information from my drivers license incorrectly, the spelling of my name, birth date etc... I even told him, but he's like it doesn't matter. It matters to me! They were not even going to call corporate to get help with my problem but when they finally did, the corporate employee handled it and I was finally able to leave the store. The exact problem was that their computer system wouldn't let them "pick" my order and close it out. Geek Squad, where are you?!
I absolutely love my new Iphone 4s! I just upgraded from Lg EnV touch. It was horrible. I decided to not get a droid, from what I heard they are horrible. Then i turned to the Iphone, I was sketchy about it. I have the tendancy to drop my phone. Since the Iphone is glass, I was worried. But if you just get a case you should be ok. I highly recomend the OtterBox phone cases.
I went from a Samsung not-smart phone to the iPhone and used Gift Cards to pay for it! I stayed with Verizon. I found the iPhone 4S to be much more sensitive, i.e., gives me more bars almost everywhere than my Samsung. The voice quality is excellent. As far as the apps, they are a pleasure to use either on 3G or WiFi. It delivers the expected Apple Experience, It Just Works! I used the Pre-order and had my iPhone on Bay 1! I stood in no lines and was activated and out the door in under an hour, despite the slowness of the systems of Verizon and Best Buy on one their record-setting traffic days. I highly recommend both the iPhone 4S and Best Buy!
Great phone! I can't believe that it is not 4G. That is the only downside which is a big one for me.
I'm glad that i returned Samsung-Droid charge & got my 1st iphone. Eventhough i had to waite about 2 1/2 weeks but it was worth it. i just wish Apple could offer more color choices for the iphone.
I love my phone and would buy another. The only problem is that in order to protect it from damage I had to give up the slim line and go bulky.
This is my first Iphone. I love the Siri; and am very pleased with the phone.
With all the features it has I went on a trip without taking my computer. I didn't need it. Just the phone!
This is my first smartphone. I have had it for 5 days and I will be returning in when I get home, possibly in many pieces. It will not hold a phone call for more than 30 seconds. You cannot hear it ring or feel it vibrate. I have spent over 5 hours trying to set up a personal ringtone, unsucsessful. I would think that a company that is growing as rapidly as Apple would have user friendly devices. This thing is the biggest piece of junk I have ever seen. I would not recommend this to anybody, even if it was free.
This phone is AMAZING! To me it is the best apple product. If your thinking about getting the iPhone 5 DON'T! They did NOT raise the battery life, and the screen is as big as the iPhone 4. So the battery life will really suck! But seriously the iPhone 4 and iPhone 4s are the best Apple iPhone products. So if you are thinking about getting an iPhone get either one of the iPhone 4 or the iPhone 4s. THEY ARE THE BEST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I would highly recommend this phone. The learning curve is easy. Much easier than most of the other phones on the market. Suri is great and I am amazed at the technology that goes into her responses and how you can ask her almost anything and get an answer.
The iPhone 4S is a great phone, the a5 chip is fast, I love the Siri feature the battery life is great, the iPhone 4S on Verizon is the best.
The phone is very well made. You can see and feel the quality in the phone. The OS not very innovating. This is my wife's phone and she is not very technical so this phone is great for people with low tech skills. It does the job for her but my Galaxy S III runs circles around it when it comes to features, power, speed and camera. Over all the phone is a good phone.
I never intended to get an iphone, but I wanted to be able to text occasionally. This phone is great for my purposes.
The phone is technologically wonderful and easy to use. It has many wonderful features. The screen is horrible. Very easy to break!!
I love my new iphone 4s. This is my first smart phone and found it to be really easy to use and find all the features. Love being able to facetime with my kid in college.
Even if I wasn't such a fan of Apple's product line, I would be thrilled with this particular Smart Phone. The iPhone 4s succeeds in a variety of ways. It fits comfortably in my hand. The color display is resilient with colors that capture the natural tones. Some others attempt to recreate the colors, but inevitably approximate them. Sound quality is exceptional. The voices that emerge from phone calls sound as if they are right by my side, close at hand. Even though I have large hands, texting is relatively easy and a relief after using other brands for way too long. Syncing with my MacBook Pro is easy and highly customizable. I don't mind taking my time to get the iPhone 5. I've seen it. It's great, but I am content for a little while longer!
IF U PEOPLE WANT THE BEST PHONE IN THE WORLD GET THIS ONE ITS AWESOME! YOULL FALL IN LOVE WITH IT!
I had a EVO - I thought that was the greatest thing - but it can't compare to this phone. The 4S was easy to set up, easy to start using, and it sooooooo has become the new Favorite Phone Ever!!! The aps are easy to get - the fact that it doesn't limit you to only 4 or 5 screens is wonderful - I love the texting - you on one side of the screen - the textee on the other half. I wish they had a free voice GPS as I use this feature a great deal. That is the only thing so far that I have found I would change - I have had this phone for about 6 weeks now.
The IPhone does it all! I use the calendar to remind me of the whole families schedule, check emails, go online & it's a great phone to. Siri is great& funny too!
It's exactly what I expected, it's easy to use, very nice, great features, light, it gives you a lot of options for different things. One thing I don't care for is that you can't send more than one photo in an email, and you can't attach photos or files to an email, you have to go to the photo or file's options and send it from there directly.
You can't really go wrong with any iPhone.. Love the ease of this phone...
I would highly recommend! Have wanted one for a long time and I got the chance to get one!
works great on Sprint, I reccomend the 32gb it seems to have enough storeage with alot of apps and movies, icloud with itunes matchh is also a great feature
The apple i4s is a good phone, easy to use for most basic functions. The manual is a bit much, would be nice to have a short phone cheatsheet. For example if the phone is ringing and you don't want to answer, it does not give you the option to ignore (hit the power button) on screeen.
I've never had an Iphone but this 4S is great.easy to use and understand the Apps........
Going from an android phone to the Iphone is a big let down. The android phones allow you to do so much more with your phone. The only thing I like better about the Iphone is the battery life. The phone interface is poor, The fact that all installed programs must have icons on the home screens. Each home screen is top left justified so you cannot choose where to keep the icons. I like to put icons near the bottom of the screen for easy thumb reach for one had operation.
Im warming up to this phone, but I miss my android. I found my HTC EVO Shift to be more user-friendly than this one. Just something I have to get used to. Battery life isn't great, but I guess most smart phones are in the same boat. SIRI doesn't live up to the hype yet. I also really miss 4G. This phone is painfully slow. Awesome camera though. I just wish I could upload directly to Facebook from camera roll. The bottom line is that for things I use the phone for most, android made it easier for me. Again, I hope to warm up to it, but at this point, still a regrettable purchase.
My only complaint about the iPhone 4S is that you have to search for the owner's manual to learn about stuff, and I learned more from other users than I was able to learn from the manual.
I love my iphone! It is so much faster and user friendly than my Epic phone! Dosn't lock up or freeze on me either! Has more features!
I have never owned an iPhone before this phone so I am new to all aspects of this phone. Needless to say I was very hyped up to buy this phone. Coming from using Microsoft, BlackBerry and Android OS, this interface seems very simplified compared to all three, although reminds me a lot of Android. The display is very vivid and very responsive to touch, this phone has never frozen or caused me any trouble. Everything is easy to sync, iTunes and iCloud make a lot of worry about loosing potential data go away. Thousands of apps to choose from and limitless amounts of music. Honestly I can find nothing wrong with this phone at all. Data is fast (for 3G), amazing camera, vivid screen, very user friendly, good battery life (for a smart phone), and over all feels very well built. Everyone has their different likings and dislikings when it comes to smart phones, every smart phone has it's pros and cons, where this phone might lack the security of BlackBerry or customization of Andriod, it makes up for it with simple interface, ease to sync, and fun over all. I have had many different types of smart phones over the years and with this phone I was looking for an easy to use phone that will not cause me any trouble, and that is exactly what I got.
I love this phone. I can store all my music, movies and apps.
I had a Blackberry before the 4S, this is my first iPhone, and I have to say I absolutely love it. I really haven't found anything that I can't do with this phone. You might as well forget about surfing the internet on you Blackberry. I don't think that the Blackberry's are really built for that, but the iPhone handles this task with ease. It seems like I learn a new cool feature every week. I love how you can control your email folders with the iPhone and keep everything organized. It's amazing to be able to put my iTunes on my phone as well, considering I have over 35gb of music in my iTunes. The only thing that is a slight draw back is that on my Blackberry when my email would come through to my inbox it instantly showed up on my phone, or it was pushed to my phone. I cannot get my Gmail accounts to push to my iPhone. I'm not sure if it is the Sprint network, iPhone, or Gmail itself that is causing this but it's the only downfall. That's the only downfall to me but it's not that serious and I will live with it for everything else that you get with this phone.
Having been with an android phone for a while now, I switched to the iPhone 4S. The iPhone completely overshadows the android phone in ALMOST every fashion. Its faster, longer battery life after the iOS update, there is an immense amount of apps, the screen is even better than the SUPER AMOLED that I had with the EPIC 4G, the camera is better, and basically it is an entirely better product. With that said, there is only one thing that the androids have gotten right. They have free navigation, even though most of the time my navigation was screwy on the android. In any case, if you are having doubts about jumping on the iPhone bandwagon, don't.
I really like the Siri feature it makes checking messages and finding information easier. The camera is easy to use and makes great pictures. Web browsing is also simple and very fast. Lots of features and of course apps!
i hope i dont know the latest one feathers but i am sure that apple is very great company always they are thinking abt customers reqired obtions i am just waiting to buy thx
this phone is ungodly! smooth, quick, easy to use. i should have left droid long ago!
Very disappointed. Only had this for 2 weeks and the paint was chipping off. Paint flakes everywhere. Spend the extra $5 and don't get this product.
It breaks easy, chips and doesn't really provide protection, feels like I waisted money, I do not recommend this product
The only thing I got this because my wifes a puma fan.lol still made of cheap plastic could got a better deal on eBay but if the wifes happy I'm happy:)
Dropped my phone several times and no problem. Plus it fits in my holder
PERFECT FIT...SLIM LINE, UNLIKE THOSE BULKY OTHER ONES THAT TAKE AWAY FROM THE SLEEKNESS OF THE IPHONE.
Soft shell case feels good, fits well and protects the iphone.
After two weeks of regular use (nothing industrial here), the left side of the case which its thin covering the volume buttons has stretched out completely. Not only is it annoying, it hinders use to the left side of the screen.
I bought this case expecting to use it as a backup to my main case - but it quickly has become my main case. It's lightweight (my phone doesn't even feel like it has a case on it(, smooth, fits great, and looks cool on the back. The biggest selling point to me was the fact that it doesn't feel bulky at all like some other cases and really blends in well with the phone.
This case was meant to be a temporary solution until I found one better...but then, I started to like it. The main reason I like this is because it is simple to put on and off. This allows me to put my drivers license and a credit card behind the phone at all times! I no longer carry a wallet and my life has become THAT much simpler, its really great.
I've had mine for over a year now and its still in great shape. I love the fact that it's very gripy so it doesn't slide off and move around when you set it down on uneven surfaces or in the car. It's made in USA, helps support our local jobs and economy. I've had friends want to buy it after seeing and holding it. It doesn't add much to the volume of the phone(4S) but adds just enough to make it easier for someone with bigger hands to hold(adult male). Simple and easy to put on and take off if you need to. I wish it was available in clear. Simple.
Nice to have a product to protect my $700 investment, and not worry about it doing its job! I live in a very harsh climate, Wyoming has all kinds of weather, and it keeps all the dirt and dust out! If it gets wet, just dry it off! I don't panic about a few raindrops getting between the screen and phone. I opened the case the other day because I had missed cleaning lint off a corner...not a speck of dust on the back all clean, looked like I just took my phone out of the box! The screen cover is durable and cleans off well. It's worth the $80 to protect your phone!
Although I was concerned about following all the steps to make the case waterproof, I really liked the online videos instructions they offer. It was very clear to me what I needed to do and it gave me confidence to test my case and if I'm ever not sure about what to do, I can go back online and check out their online video tutorials again.
This is a great case but is difficult to insert phone cord to charging due to it being waterproof. Just takes some time to get the cord in properly. Case is much thinner than the OtterBox that I previously used.
This is a great product that will protect you iPhone from broken screen or water damage. Don,t have to worry when grandkids is using my phone.
The lifeproof case is remarkable for the person who is a little hard on thier electronics, like me. The ONLY down side to this case is the charger issue.
I had my case for almost two months now and I did the water test on the case before I put my phone in it and it passed,I also check the case everyday to make sure it's sealed together and yet the first time I dropped my phone into water the phone broke. So I would not recommend this if you are going to have your phone anywhere near water.
The cover was too expensive for a case. It's durable and waterproof if someone is looking for this use.
I've seen some bad things said about their customer service but give them a break! They will get back to you and they WILL make things right if it needs to be made right! They are a growing company and they are growing fast because their product is actually what they advertise! At first I was skeptical about the sound. How can it be waterproof and you still use it? Then they started speaking my language......Gor-tex! I've been using it in hunting boots for years! It's breathable, yet waterproof!
What I can tell you is that MY experience with this case has been all positive. Put it on the phone before vacation to Florida. First day of vacation- dropped phone in a sandy parking lot (and didnt know it- no pavement to "thud" against). Phone was then picked up by someone who did not turn it into lost and found :-( Long story short, a number was called from my phone so we called it and eventually spoke to someone who knew - the person said "oh, is this a pink iPhone" right away we knew they had it and I was getting it back! And I did get it back!! All in one piece, no scratches, dents, anything. The case is secure so it doesnt just pop off easily. So I retested the waterproofness when I got it back...all good. Had a BLAST taking underwater pictures in the pool!! Worth every penny! I love it!!
I bought this on the advise of a friend and I am very happy with it.
A friend recommended this case to me and I'm so glad I purchased it. The main reason for purchasing this case is it slides into my purse and pocket easily and doesn't get "hung up" like my Otter Box. I did the water test before putting my phone in it and there was no leakage. The only thing I don't like is even with the volume on high the ringer isn't as loud. After several missed calls, I just keep my phone with me now. That's the only negative thing about this phone case. You can not go wrong with this phone case!
For the price, we were expecting for the product to at least keep the iphone secure and free of anything getting between the screen and the shield and that did not happen. I have had to take to case off twice now to wipe off the screen when oil residue had left marks. I have not had the case near water or any condensation so this should not even be a concern but unfortunately it is. The volume on and off tab on the left side is already cracking and I have had the case for just barely over a month. Not satisfied!
I have broken two otterboxes, but my phone did survive. My child's otterbox also broke, but the phone did survive as well. The other problem we had with the otterbox is the silicon cover would stretch out of shape, and the case was bulky. The Lifeproof protects against water, dirt, snow, and shock damage all in a case that is lightweight, slim, and slides comfortably in the pocket. The pink is a nice shade with a hint of sparkle if you look at it just right. The gray part is made of different material making it easy to have a good hold on the phone. It looks like the phone itself is pink or whatever color you choose. I just use apple chargers or accessories or other brands with the same design or an adapter if needed to use the charge/accessory port. I don't use my headphones much,but you do have to have a special cord which is included in order to use headphones. As with any case, there is a increased risk of the screen breaking if the screen comes in contact with a sharp, pointed object like a rock. I do recommend this case to other family members and friends and would like to get ones of these for my iPad when available. Too bad lifeproof does not make these for iPods. The silicon on the Otterbox for those is tearing.
I purchased this case for my husband for Christmas. He was always complaining about his Otterbox Defender (it protects well against falls; however, the skin stretches alot and it is NOT waterproof) being too bulky and unable to slide into his pocket. He loved the Lifeproof case! So, I splurged and bought one for myself. I really love my case...keeps the dust out, protects against falls and moisture. In fact, I am not buying my new iPad until Lifeproof brings its iPad case to market! I am sold on Lifeproof!
I was really excited about this case, especially since I'm so clumsy. It makes it look like I had an entirely pink iPhone, which I loved. But my car charger wouldn't fit with the case on. It was a hassle taking it off in the car every time it began to die before I made it home. Only the Apple Wall Charger fits in the slot, so I traded it for an Otter Box. If they fix that issue, I could see myself repurchasing it, though. It truly was water & shock proof, just a little hard to charge.
I have been extremely happy with my Lifeproof Case. I went from an archaic nextel military rated phone to the iphone. While I have yet to accidently drop any phone (really only 2) I have in water I do habitually drop them getting into the car, pulling them out of my purse, and while handing them off to the kids so I wanted a case that would protect my investment. It has exceeded my expectations at protecting my iphone. It has been dropped without incident more than once in 3 months. I love the pink. My husband has a black case that is working out great as well. I love that we know whose phone is whose. The only complaint that I would have is the static spot, or oily looking spot I get occasionally. It's my understanding that this is because we live where there is more humidity and can't be helped. That being said I will gladly live with a little "oil spot" if I can totally protect my phone. I also loved freaking my husband out when I "submerged" his phone 2 inches under the water in the hot tub. He didn't realize it was waterproof :-) He has now been known to take it in the shower so he can accompany his singing :)
I have bought a Lifeproof case for everyone in my family. LOVE LOVE LOVE Lifeproof
I love that it's slim and not bulky like otter box
The dummy me who drops everything I am now safe.. Love it..
When I opened item, I followed directions exactly as they stated. Works really cool. At first the volume didn't seem that loud but with apple's new update it is louder. When using facetime it was harder for the person to hear me had to speak louder. Other than that it is a cool product and so far I love it. I have the pink and grey one like the colors, the pink is light so it doesn't look like the pepto pink ones!!!
This is the best case made for the iPhone. It doesn't make the phone too bulky, and its made of polycarbonate which allows it to slide in and out of your pocket easily. I take my phone out fishing with me and I never have worry about water as its the only truly waterproof case.
I purchased this cover just a few weeks ago. I returned it for a new one because of the oil spot on the screen. Same thing happened with the new one though. I guess it is a flaw in the design of the product. Speaker is muffled and tinny.
This case is great! It is a hard plastic case and then a silicone cover goes over the hard plastic. Durability of plastic and gripping ability of silicone. The only problem that I've found is that the button to mute the phone is difficult to access. It can be done, but it's tough. Fortunately, I have long nails.
I was looking for something durable but was tired of my outter box & this worked perfect. Love that it fits in my pocket & my phone is now all pink:)
I love this case. I recently purchased an iphone and looked at many cases. I really love the fact that this is very thin and water proof. Not to mention I love the color pink so this is the perfect case for my new phone. One thing though, the screen gets that ugly oily area eventhough I cleaned my phone before putting the case on. Other than that I really love this case.
never ending search for the perfect case ends here. I've gone through so many cases and money searching for that one case that provides the protection i need for my lifestyle and job description, as an EMS/Firefighter, this case is PERFECT! Mil Spec rating for drops and dust protection as well as the best part of it.......wait for it.......IP-68 rating waterproof protection up to 6.6 feet. It's thin and lightweight and doesn't stick to your pocket, all the buttons and ports are easily accessible without ever taking the case off. I HIGHLY recommend this case and every product they put out, Best customer service and company i have ever dealt with. I honestly can't wait for what this company has in store for us in the future, I'm hooked, LifeProof for life.......Let's Go!
I would never recommend this phone case to anyone. I had my daughter's iPhone in this case and not even a full week and the front glass shattered after one drop from 2 ft high from my truck. I now have to send her phone to get the repaired and I will go back to Otter box. Don't throw your money away like I did. Also the access point to get to the headphone jack is horrible. You have to screw in an extra piece to access the headphone jack.
I bought this case. I love it and it more protective! I love the color! I have tested to take my iPhone when I showered, it really works!! It is the best case that I am looking for!
I love my pink Lifeproof case! I love knowing that it is safe from water, drops, dirt, snow, etc. I have small children so it puts my mind at ease knowing that it is completely protected when they grab a hold of my phone. I have had the case for a few months now and the ony complaint that I have is that the case rattles when it rings or you play music but in my opinion it is still a good trade off for the protection that the case provides. I have been wanting to convert my iPhone to a pink one and this saves me the hassle of doing so all while giving me amazing protection. I love Lifeproof and will never consider ever buying another case! I can't wait to get one in white as well!
This case is awesome! Sound quality is fine, no dust or dirt under case, and although I don't make a habit of submerging all the time it is super nice to be able to play angry birds in the shower. I love the color!
LifeProof = water - shock- snow- sand = fun life !!!! I don't have to worry about my phone. I can use it anywhere. In the shower, on the boat, in the rain..... I've had my case since August and it is the best case ever. Customer Service is great, too. Warranty on case is fantastic. Really nice to have such a great US company. Join them on their FaceBook fan page. They are very fun! Bought them for my husband, brother, god-daughter. Can't wait for the rest of the family to get an iPhone. Belt Clip is great too!!!! Let's Go!!!!!!
Back when LifeProof first came out with the iPhone case we bought a pink one for my wife. She's used her case for almost a year now and has had no problems with it at all. The cases are very sleek and don't stick to the inside of your pocket like most of the other iPhone cases on the market. My wife absolutely loves her pink one. she says it looks "classy". Being able to go swimming and taking incredibly crystal clear underwater videos is amazing. Knowing that if you accidentally drop your phone in the dirt, mud, rain, sand, or snow and not having to worry that it's ruined is very comforting. I've had just about every iPhone case that's available and the LifeProof case far exceeds them all.
This case is pretty pink and rocks could have freedom without it must have and super sleek works great water snow dirt all
I bought this case because I have two small Nieces that enjoy playing with my phone, and I didn't want to take any chances in terms of it breaking. Positives: It's definitely drop-proof. I've dropped my phone at least three times since I bought it in November (all have been on concrete) and it's been perfect afterward - no cracks or breaks anywhere. I haven't had a need to see if it's water proof or not. Nice, tight fit. This case is great for when I take my phone out on the town - it's not big and bulky like an otter box or other cases and I can just tuck it in my back pocket. Negatives: Sound quality. With the charger door shut the sound quality just isn't as good. Charger cable - if you have the older charger cable that is a little bigger in size (like 1'' big), it won't work and it won't fit. You have to have a charger with the smaller size (the one that is .5''). Headphone jack - If you have an "L" shaped headphone jack then it won't fit - i've had to use just my iPhone headphones that came with it. When I took apart my case a couple days ago, the seal on the inside started coming off...not sure if that's supposed to happen or not. All in all it's a good case, but i'm not as thrilled with it as I thought I would be. Still, I believe you get your money's worth in terms of protection, but not in sound quality and other small things.
Bought this phone to replace an older iPhone. Old one was possessed. Daughter loves this phone. Loves the new camera feature to be able to talk to another iphone user and actually SEE them. Also likes that the upgrade to the new phone was simple and luckily, thanks to iCloud, she lost nothing! Great phone for a great price. Old one lasted about 2 years. Hoping this one lasts alot longer! :)
I chose this item over the otter box because it was smaller and it was recommended by my brother the i genious. I am happy with it overall but the speaker being muffled stops people from hearing me well at times.
This is the best protective case you can buy. My two biggest issues are dropping and getting it wet. This case protects it from both! It is not just water resistant it is waterproof. Able to drop your phone into water and pull it out and it works.
I would recommend one for anyone would needs extra protection. As a swim coach I wouldn't trust my phone with anything else.
Great product at a reasonable price. Feels secure and works very good for taking pictures under water.
I love this iphone case. I have a habit of dropping my phone in water, so it is perfect for me.
I would never recommend this case, it did not protect the phone against shattering and the cover is too far from the phone.
It's great for protecting against water but not so good for hearing messages due to tightness of case.
great case, looks great and fits so the Phone stays slilm and the belt clip is a bit big, but holds the phone very tightly
this is my second case i had the purple and i gave it to my son so i bought today the pink and grey this cases is the best case out there i have had it over 6 months and i shower with it it has falllen alot and it aslo fell in a bucket of water and my iphone did not get damged at all.. a great buy last long durable i just cant find nuthing wrong with it.. like i said my second case diffrent color..
This is a wonderful product as far as phone protection. It was, however, a little on the expensive side at $79.99. Lifeforce case even has a screw plug to protect the headphone/auxillary jack from water damage, so yes this is a great case if you want to protect your investment.
I require a heavy duty case- because when I choose a "pretty" case over a durable one- my phone suffers... I just shattered a screen which could have been EASILY avoided if I'd had a case like this! I like that it's a hinge case, and I really don't have to pry anthing apart, or take the silicone off first before I get into it. It snaps together really easy, but stays in place perfectly! Every bit of my phone is protected, whereas the otterbox still had exposed areas. The protection around the screen is great because there is no chance for injury to the phone. I didn't find it any more bulky than the otterbox defender, I am VERY happy with this case! Also on my otterbox defender case, I had a hard time keeping the flaps in their places- this case does not have this problem at all!
This protector feels like a toy. Everything is made of cheap plastic and the snapps that hold it together ate so thin that if you take it off your phone a couple times they will snapp right off.
I really like this case. It's sophisticated and feminine, with a shimmery gold back. The only thing I would like better is if the border were crack-resistant and had a little more of a lip to protect the face.
well dont buy this item it has a bunch of problems and i will be returning it, first off there is no cut out for the silence button, second the buttons are all little and you cant even tell if your pressing them or not i dont like that, third very bad quality from the speakers especially when making phone calls very hard to hear whose talking to you. only thing i like about this case is the way it looks and that it does feel durable, also it doesn't fit in the holster well you have to kind of work it in not good.
Join the crowd. It's a great phone, great computer, great everything. Accessories are plentiful....nothing bad to say.
The iPhone 4S features a powerful dual-core A5 chip with faster graphics for browsing the Web, switching between apps, gaming and more. The 8.0MP camera boasts advanced optics and shoots 1080p HD...
I had gone without a phone for about 1 1/2 years and finally couldn't handle being teased anymore so I bought this iPhone. I love it! Couldn't be easier to use as far as texting, emailing, taking photos and managing apps. The only complete fail is Siri. That goofy "assistant" does NOT work. I've fought with her 10 times and totally given up on the functionality.
I love the iphone. Now I don't have to carry two devices in the car. I have the convenience of blue tooth phone and ipod. The only drawback, so far, is that iphone does not support Adobe.
Again, another APPLE product that "out-of-the-box" is horrible!!! you cant do anything with this phone. kind of sad when i have to pay all this money for a smart phone, and its no smarter than a standard flip phone. the only way to make this thing "great" as it says it can be, is to jailbreak it. I am annoyed that for as expensive as it is, that i wouldnt have to do anything illegal to it. And, not too mention, apple only works with apple. its a monopoly. So because i dont have itunes, i dont have music on my phone... def going back to droid. droid is awesome straight out of the box. and is compatible with anything and everything. NO HASSLES. just point and it works...
I love my IPhone 4S!!! This is the phone that you need to get!!!
I am on my iPhone now filling out the review. I love my iPhone. I am so glad Verizon carried it. I got my phone at best buy because I had rewards Certificates and gift cards. Guys at mobile department Were awesome!!!
After using (and enjoying) a Droid for 2 years, I opted to go with the iPhone to get better sync with my other Mac products (MacBook and iPad). The change was HUGE! All in all, if you use an Android based phone with "normal" pc's - stick with it....Google and Apple will never cooperate and you'll find it easier to stay in system; but if you have anything else Mac you would find a huge benefit in the iPhone!!
I had a blackberry before this phone and I can't even believe the difference. The iphone 4s is awesome! It's so easy to use and lots of fun to play with! Siri sometimes doesn't understand what you are saying so that can get annoying. But other than that, this is the best phone!
Love Siri, can't wait for that feature on my iPad. Within a couple hours of getting the phone, I had my Outlook contacts and email synced with the phone. Photo Stream is great, I just took pictures on campus and now they've uploaded to my computer so I can share. Such a simple and beautiful interface.
I have been anti-apple for so long but I finally broke down and got the 4s about a month ago. I feel like I have sold my soul to the darkside but I would do it again without hesitation. The 4S is incredibly fast and intuitive. Siri is fun and the interface is so simple yet intense. I have no complaints at all. The camera takes better pictures than and 12mp Canon and HD video is awesome with two kids.
Switched from Apple as new Android models are too large to carry phone comfortably in pocket (replaced original Droid). While not 4G, the size was the determining factor in the switch. cool phone... Very happy. PS. Not sure 32gb was necessary (i have 3 full movies, 400 songs, 20 apps, and 20gb free)
Not exactly cutting edge, but what it does, it does well.
Absolutely love it. Switch to this from the droid platform. Yes, some apps cost instead of being being free, but they work and my phone hasnt frozen yet. Well worth the money...and I am anti apple out of principle.
The iPhone 4S is essentially a faster, more robust version of the iPhone 4. It does include Siri, but this will be less significant as the iPhone 4 receives this in an update. Siri's abilities are inconsistent, but can be very useful depending on your needs. The phone's battery life is worse than my Motorola Droid 3 which is not only several months older but also runs significant custom software and home layovers that drain battery at a quicker than normal rate. In all, this phone has not sold me on Apple's closed off, overly controlled philosophy but it is lightyears ahead of the Blackberry we were previously using in the office.
I was a die hard android user. My husband talked me into trying the iPhone. I must admit I HATED it for the first week. However, the more I use it the more I like it.
This is the first smartphone I've had and I love it. It is so easy to use - very intuitive. I now use it for nearly everything - managing calendar, emails, reminders, etc. And Siri is an amazing feature. Now I wonder how I ever got along without it!
The phone is an excellent improvement over its predecessor. The camera is better. I use the Siri feature all the time. The processor is fast. I haven't any problems, and with the new software update the battery power is longer, despite what many of the reviews have said.
Thoroughly enjoying my new Iphone 4s. I upgraded from the 1st generation Blkberry Storm...so this is a huge change. All in all, anything I am thinking or trying to do - this phone will do it.
I recently switched to this phone from an older android phone. So far I love this phone! I am able to sync with my MacBook with ease and the new iCloud feature works great. I would recommend this to anyone?
Best iPhone yet. I'm upgrading from a 3GS and this one is a million times faster. The screen makes even 3GS pictures look good. Siri is fun and handy, but needs a little bit of work. Still a great added feature though. I have read a little about bad battery life and so far I can't tell for sure. I'm still using it a lot to get a good feel for how well the battery will perform. Speech to text is very handy too.
I waited five painful years for the iPhone to come to Verizon, then another eight long months for the new 4s model to be released, and I'm so happy I did! The phone is fantastic -- the camera is better than my handheld digital, the Siri ap is a priceless asset to getting through my day, and the convenience and ease (plus Verizon's ability to not have dropped calls) have made the past two weeks the happiest I've had in owning a cell phone. This is the phone worth waiting for, but the wait is over -- get it and enjoy!
First of all let me start by saying iLove the trade-in program at BestBuy. I traded in my 16GB iPhone 4 and received $270 and walked out with a 32GB iPhone 4S. Now the phone, the camera is much improved, takes photos faster, has better facial recognization and focus. Siri is just amazing, didn't think i would use it alot, but such normal tasks as setting the alarm, are now so easy you dont have to thumb thru menu's and scrolls, you just tell her and it's done. The A5 processor seems to make web pages load faster on 3G as well as WiFi. The notifications in iOS5 are simply amazing! The updated GPS sensor makes for more accurate positioning. Battery life is about the same or a tad less than the iPhone4 with "heavy" daily use.
This..... is the most amazing phone i have EVER had. I've owned blackberries and droids, but this is far none, the best phone i have ever owned/used and it's my first iPhone. And i'll tell you what, this phone is absolutely ridiculous!! It's lightning fast on the internet, the apps are super clear and very very quick, the camera audio and picture quality is better than my $400 canon camera.. The call clarity is astounding. There are soooo many features to this phone that it's hard to keep up. The new iPhone 4S is also very easy to use and no doubt, user friendly. I would recommend this phone to anybody looking for a new phone. I give this phone without a doubt, a 10/10.
For the money, not so sure that the Apple Iphone is worth it. I think I can get an android for less money whenever my renewal is up. I thought I had to have an Iphone because everyone raved about them. My droid had similiar features and was less expensive.
Phone is great and I got an Otter case and that really protects it My 3 1/2 mo old great dane tried to chew it and case protected the phone Will see what happens when we are traveiling
I was looking for this for a long time ago, I used to protect my iphone with apple´s bumpers and carry it in my pocket which was a problem to get the phone when i´m sitting, I had to stand to get the phone out of my pocket. Also i couldn´t carry coins or hard things on that same pocket because of the risk of damaging the iphone. I was looking for something like a case but not bulky to hold the phone on my belt and free my pocket. This works like a charm. It´s lightweight the case is very sleek and good looking. I would recommend to use a screen protector with this case, however, the iphone screen is made with gorilla glass, which is a lot more resistant to scratches than common glass so maybe the screen protectors are just for peace of mind rather than being useful.
I had been looking awhile for a sleek, slim, lightweight case to carry my IPhone 4 after breaking the one that I had previously, which was discontinued at the AT&T Store.. The case is not cheap, but works really well and is definitely worth the cost. IPhones are a little larger than many other cell phones. This case and holster minimizes the bulk or size, by being lightweight and thin, but very durable and has a very pleasant rubbery smooth finish on both the case and holster. I have only had it for a month, but so far I am very pleased with the case. This type is hard to find; I know because I had been looking for weeks before finding this one at Best Buy.
Love this case and clip because it keeps the phone very close to my body and it is the best I have found.
I prefer to have hard cases for my Apple devices, so I went with a brand I have come to trust in protecting my devices, iFrogz. With the case/holster combination, you get a good snap-on case and a holster that doesn't make the phone too large. I like that you can slide the phone in to either leave the face exposed or protected. The only drawback of the design is not being able to easily access the dock connector. So when I use my phone in the car or go to charge it at home, I have to remove it from the holster. A better design would have been to go with smaller braces on the sides, but they would have to be strong or possibly cover the speakers in one position and the headphone jack in the other position. Oh, and the belt clip only rotates 180 degrees, also preventing you from taking advantage of every option for positioning the phone to leave the dock connector exposed but still access most features.
Let's consider this case in two parts: the cradle into which the phone installs, and the cover. The cradle is great, nice feeling texture, not very bulky. For my use, I like it. Now, the cover. It goes on hard, comes off hard. The first time I withdrew the phone from it, it left a scratch on the screen protector. A few minutes later I took it out again, and there was a circular mark on the screen that lined up with the clip's pivot point. Really a terrible product. The idea is good, but it really needs work. If you decide to try one, BE SURE YOU HAVE A SCREEN PROTECTOR ON YOUR PHONE!
The Frogz is too tight case and may need to break-in time before it is comfortable to fit and Stand is very flimsy for iPhone to be secure on the hip or belt
Multifunction Case looks good and keeps my iPhone secure. I have received many compliments from co-workers.
I've always used a belt clip of some kind for any cell phone I've ever had (from my first 2 Nokia's that were the leather pouches, to my Samsung i760 with a snap on belt clip, to my DROID1 Verizon belt clip). This one is by far the sturdiest I have used. The screen goes towards your body while in the belt clip so it doesn't get scratched or damaged. The clip itself, which is usually the first thing to break due to weak plastic, weak hinge, or a weak spring, is amazing on this case. It uses very thick plastic, and the spring shows no sign of wear or weakness from when I originally got it (02-x-2012). The belt clip comes with a two-piece case that goes around the iPhone itself. I'm very happy with it and have dropped the phone a few times and have been quite pleased that nothing broke. It didn't even separate when I dropped it! It doesn't need a head phone adapter, it fits in my car mount (Satechi CR-3600 Universal Car Holder), and I have had no issues using any 3rd party dock extension cables (which I use with my Pioneer radio and some 3rd party chargers). I can't say I've tried using any docks though. The only thing missing would be a built in kick stand, or a built in screen protector....but really, I'm just nitpicking at this point. Overall, very happy with my purchase, and a good price too!
I bought this case because my original case allowed my iPhone 4s to fall out at least 3 times, fortunately without any damage! This case retains my phone well and my phone is easy to access.
Works perfectly to protect my phone so I can keep it with me and listen to music while doing chores.
I only had it for a couple days, but it was cool. Just wasn't for me. I didn't like things hanging on my belt and the case was to bulky for me to have it in my pocket. But for a belt mounted case it's good.
My Seidio belt holster broke right before a business trip. I went to BB looking for a replacement. This is the exact same case that I purchaed from SEIDIO only it was $15 cheaper and no shipping charges. Very slim fit. belt clip broke due to my own fault. I had the other one for 6 mos. w/o incident. would buy again.
Really liked at first until the clip broke within two weeks. I still use the case, it's slim and fits good.
Provides adiqut Protection with a great design. The best part is the screen in clip!
Just purchased, but so far so good. The fit for the phone (iPhone 4S) is really good and the sleeve is lined with felt so it should protect the back from being scratched. Great combination of a protective case that can be used by itself or inserted into the holster. Good feel for the case, but it isn't anti slip. Only possible concern at this point is the wear of the clip holding the phone into the holster.
For a Beginner especially, using this iPhone is a hit or miss process for the first few months. On two small sheets of paper that come in the box are the very basic, yet incomplete instructions that are in small type that needs a magnifying glass to read. Out of frustration I bought an 'iPhone for Dummies' to get to know how the basic functions are done. Apple would do well to offer the User more information on how to use this iPhone, in a well documented, easily readable booklet.
the 4s is much easier to use and the battery lasts longer than my old android. For me this is the perfect phone.
I replaced my thunderbolt with this phone last month, i miss the 4g lte download speeds, but that's about it. Over wi-fi this iPhone 4s is actually faster than the thunderbolt, speedtest app proves that. Camera is 8 megapixel but clearly more advanced than thunderbolt 8 megapixel. I also have macbook and these 2 devices work hand in hand. Its amazing how "things just work". Siri is not bad, it'll be better after the ios6 update in September. Overall great phone, easy to use, can't wait for updates in a couple of months.
Battery life, the battery life is too short and requires several recharging during the day. Nonetheless, great Apple product!
My first iphone and Apple product and it's great. I like that it is so much faster than any phone I have had. Now i just tap on the icon and I connected immediately, I'm doing so much more on my iphone because it's faster, no more waiting minutes and minutes for a connections as on my old phone(I didn't use a lot of the features because it was so slow). Pictures and videos are of great quality, to me this is a fantastic investment. I'm loving Siri !!
This is a great phone and it is easy to use. The apps are great and the camera is the best I've had so far on a phone. Overall it functions well and I am happy with it. The only downside is the durability of it. The first day my husband dropped the phone out of his pocket and the whole back of it shattered like glass. I have dropped every phone I have ever had and I have never seen anything like this before.
I like siri use it all time! Used droids and this Tops them!!!
I enjoy it a lot, it's very very useful for almost anything.
After purchasing (from Verizon Store) and returning 2 NEW Droid Razr Maxx s due to overheating, I purchased my 1st iPhone 4s from BEST Buy. "Hats Off" to BEST Buy Sales Personnel for EXCELLENT Customer Service.
I am really happy with my new phone. I use the calendar function sharing with my husband. We each have our own color with a separate color for shared appointments. This has really simplified our appointment process. iCloud is great. The camera is second to none. I have given up using a separate camera. The video function is also great. The phone is easy to use ( my learning curve was a little long on this function). Siri is finally getting to understand me or is it I am understanding her better?
My first smartphone: Calendar options make for easy appointment creating. Available app possiblites are endless. Meaning I have one to store my grocery list, no more pen/paper. One to help me find the nearest cheapest gas station. The map app helps me find new stores and resturants nearby when I'm in a part of town I don't go to often.
My first smart phone and I love being connected all the time... This makes texting a breeze. Also viewing pictures on the phone is great.. With the old phone the pictures were small and not clear.. It was so bad there was no reason to even send me a picture..
This iPhone has to be the best phone on the market, its easy to use and very fun. I had the iPhone 4 and had to upgrade to the 4S for obvious reasons like Siri (and is she intelligent)! I love my phone so much!
I got my iPhone 4S almost 3 weeks ago after owning a Droid Incredible 2, which I discovered was only incredible at being horrible. So, after numerous visits at Verizon with a few master resets I finally gave up and bought this at full retail price and sold the replacement (Good luck to you, buyer!). Within about 30 minutes, I activated it and set up my iTunes account and it synced all of my apps directly to the device. The second thing I noticed is that it hardly ever gets bogged down; EVER! On the Incredible 2 it was part of the daily routine. Siri is a thousand times better than the voice control function on Android. Plus you can ask her funny questions like, "Who created you?" and she'll give an accurate response. Apps are awesome! There are more apps available on the App Store than Android Market/Google Play. Technically, the only con I can think of is it is limited to only digital content purchased through iTunes; I can't sync the music I purchased on AmazonMP3. But that's not a big deal since I have a Kindle Fire. Everybody, purchase this phone right now! Do not get Android, no matter how good it seems. If you are eligible for an upgrade, I promise you you will not be disappointed if you scroll up and click the 'Buy' button right now!
I simply love it, very stable product. It has all my needs, for devotionals, travels, email, music, readings, radio.... you name it. Extremely convenient.
I was a droid user but switched to the iphone. I especially like the microphone feature for emails and texts.
The processing speed has increased and I personally love using Siri to place phone calls, send texts and answering questions - she's not perfect, but pretty good. I thought the price was still a bit much when all the iPhone competitors are able to offer discounts, but I kept with the iPhone for its increased security measures - eg: they review all apps before entering them into the iTunes store. Also love the "face time" video phone calls when you're near wi-fi spots!
Awesome phone, don't know why it took me so long to switch to the iPhone. Can't wait till the iPhone 5 comes out.
This is my first smart phone. I have had it for a about a month. It's been fun to learn about it's features and the apps are amazing. I'm very happy I made this purchase.
I am new to the world of Smart Phones. iPhone 4S has been a wonderful and seamlessly easily integrating phone. By this I mean it made my transition into the use of Smart Phones very easy. I am glad I picked iPhone 4S as my first pick for a new Smart Phone. I recommend it to anyone who is interested in a new phone. There is an app for literally everything!! I got a great military grade Griffin Case that is very durable and makes the fact that the phone is a drop hazzard a thought that no longer matters. Since I am a big texter, I found a great app, Text Free, that allowed me to remove my text package from my cell carrier and use that for all my texting needs...and it is just what it says=FREE. Free texting is great and it helped me as far as budget is concerned since the difference in the data package I had to add and the text package I deleted was the same amount...so I broke even!
My server is Verizon. The speed is great. I commute into NYC on the train and my work computer does not support any personal sites. I can stay in communication with personal emails, FB, and anything else. I've downloaded a slot machine where the graphics are so good it's like playing the real thing in a casino. I downloaded my daily readings. Taking photos and videos are so easy, much easier than my Droid. Even sliding the lock off to answer the phone is much easier on this. The only thing is Siri. If you think she's going to understand you like she understands the celebrities in the commercial, no way. She's good enough for a robot in a hand held phone! I have never been as happy with any inanimate object as I am with this phone. Oh, and I have no problem with the battery.
I am enjoying the phone to a certain point I think some of the features could improve to make it a little easier to use. I am not impressed with the 3G service through Verizon Network. Overall I like it.. It's like carrying around a mini computer.
TOO MANY WONDERFUL THINGS TO MENTION. HOWEVER THERE ARE A FEW BASIC THINGS THAT REGULAR PHONES DO THAT YOU WOULD THINK THIS PHONE WOULD DO AS WELL. 1, ANNOUNCE CALLERS NAME WHEN RINGING 2.DECLINE A CALL AND SEND A TEXT TO LET THE CALLER KNOW YOU WILL CALL RIGHT BACK (WHILE ITS RINGING). 3. BATTERY LIFE SUCKS!!! 4.DOESNT HAVE SWYPE TO TEXT
5 stars I would recommend this phone to anyone. I have enjoyed using my iphone and love all the apps from the appstore
I switched from an Android to iPhone 4S and couldn't be happier. While the Android was very good I have to rate the iPhone as great. It just simply works better and with the iCloud feature and an accompanying iPad2 I don't often use my desktop PC or my Toshiba laptop but with rare exception. My next purchase will be a MacBook Air. Apple has done an excellent job of integrating their devices and made me a believer. Speed and reliability are hallmarks of Apple in my book. I'm officially sold and would recommend the switch from Android technology to anyone.
I had an iPod Touch, so I thought I knew what to expect from an iPhone, but I got more than I could hope for.
My dream phone is here.. Upgraded from Windows mobile.
Clearly, the features and potential of this phone are phenomenal - great to have iTunes, phone, texts and e-mails on the same device. The sales team at Best Buy was extremely knowledgeable, being able to not only answer questions, but explain the features without being asked. Between Verizon, Best Buy and my teenager, I am becoming an expert. Strongly recommend this phone to anyone who wants / needs a high quality, multi - functional device, who also has the patience to learn how to use it to the full potential.
It is so smart. Love talking Siri. Great pictures. Fine sound. Handy. Still haven't explored all the features to their full extent. Always love Apple products. This is one of its best. Great product. Made my day!
I had resisted trading in my old flip phone for a smart phone for ages because I was just sure I would never be able to master all the ins & outs of the device. And wasn't sure I would even use half the available features. My family and co-workers heckled me relentlessly until I finally made the leap. I originally purchased a Droid Razr but found it to be way too complex for a virgin smart phone user. But thanks to Best Buy's generous exchange policy I traded it for an iPhone 4S a few weeks later. Learning the iPhone was so much easier than the Droid. Wish I hadn't put it off so long. I picked this phone up and within minutes I was hooked. Don't know how I managed without it before. Previously I rarely even texted-mostly because it is a huge pain on a flip phone. But now with Siri's help, I just dictate the text and press send. And I love not having to carry my iPod and a phone. I just transferred my iTunes library to my iPhone and now my music is always with me.Love, love, love it!
This device does everything you could ask of a phone and then some. It is truly a miniature computer with amazing access to the world. It will take a long time to fully realize everything it can do, but it is easy to use from the get go.
My FIRST iphone was not working properly, but after a trip to the Apple store, it was replaced with one that was working!! I am finally beginning to enjoy using it and discover all its' potential.
Unfortunately the phone needs to be charged at least on a daily basis.
Awesome phone. Use it for personal and business. User friendly and easy to learn.
I like the phone, but it has a learning curve. I just don't have the time to train for it. Am getting used to it a little at a time
I am having sooo much fun with this phone. Excellant choice and great service from the staff at the Best Buy at 23/Gratiot - they were ALL so very helpful
i bought this phone for my first smartphone purchase. my teenage son said it was really easy to operate and he was right.i checked prices with verizon and apple and decided to buy it at best buy because of the blacktie protection plan.at $15 a month and no deductible it beat verizons insurance plan..plus a discount if you pay the full 2 years up front..also love the buy back program..for $30 they will buy it back from me in 2 years for $160..that will almost cover my next phone..win-win!
THE IPHONE IS A GOOD PHONE WITH MANY GREAT FEATURES HOWEVER YOU WILL BE LUCKY TO GET THROUGH A DAY WITH THIS HORRIBLE BATTERY IT HAS. I JUST BOUGHT IT LESS THAN ONE WEEK AND I ALREADY HAD TO EXCHANGE IT AND THAT DID NOT MAKE ANY DIFFERNCE. IT STILL SUCKS
Siri is the best. Easy to make phone calls and put in reminders. Have to learn to download apps but will learn soon. Already had a friend purchase the same phone.
I love my iPhone! I had to settle on one with less memory, since the local best buy didn't have the one I wanted, but am still very happy with my purchase. I marked that it's tough/durable only because I bought the Otter Case with it.
Overall I like the iphone 4s. Has a lot of great features.
I have a lot to learn, but this phone is great. Once you get the hang of it , it is quite user freindly. Love the camera and video feature.
It is a very simple and easy phone to use. The only draw back is that it is fragile with glass screen and glass back.
I am really enjoying the iPhone. It does everything that I needed it to do, and more. I am concerned about the rattling noise from the top of the phone, near the camera or on/off switch. I noticed the rattle the first week that I purchased it.
I put off getting a smart phone as long as possible, and I am not normally a huge fan of Apple products. This phone is easy to use, and a great tool for keeping oneself organized and entertained. The scratch resistant glass has held up to coins, keys, one drop on concrete, and a toddler so far without any marring. Siri is a neat application, but it does take some time to use it effectively. I highly recommend downloading WolframAlpha to expand Siri's computational database. Games are intuitive and fun for the most part. Applications work smoothly without crashing, so long as you stick with known application developers. Call quality can get iffy at times, but I believe that is more due to tower placement in an area versus any flaw in the phone design. If you are on the fence as I was and this will be your first phone or first venture into Apple products, you will not be disappointed. Picture quality is phenomenal. The Retina display on the 4S is a more dense pixel count than even the new iPad. My only two complaints are the cost of accessories for iPhones and the battery life. Whether an Apple-branded accessory or third-party, all of the accessories are overpriced as compared to other smart phone manufacturers. A full charge will last a whole day, but be certain to recharge throughout the day if possible and definitely plug in every night.
I am so happy with my new IPhone. I will never own another kind of phone again. The apps are fantastic, the color is superior, the camera is phenomenal. So impressed with the quality, this phone is beyond compare
I absolutely love this phone! I waited forever to buy a smartphone as I knew they would make them better and I didn't want to pay for a data package, but I finally gave up and got one...and now I can't go back. This phone has virtually everything I need. It works great and is useful at work too. The battery life is good, but if GPS location is running at all, it drains pretty fast.
This phone is great! The 4s' camera works really, really well. The touchscreen is great and I have found it MUCH easier to type on this than my larger screened DroidX. All around a better phone and my using it the last couple of months has convinced me to purchase the new iPad that is coming out next week! However, there ARE some caveats that I don't understand Apple not catching: There is no speed dial. You know how you can assign phone numbers to the 0-9 buttons of the phone and one long press dials that number for you? Not available on the iPhone. Every phone in the last 30 years has had this feature and iPhone leaves it off??? Curious. It DOES have a "favorites" list though, and it's "almost" as good. Also, there is no stock voice navigation for the iPhone 4s. It has maps, and can map your destination for you, and follow you as you get there, but there is no voice guidance telling you when to turn. So if you use this as you're driving you'd have to be looking at your phone all the time! Apps are available but decent ones are $50 or more. Android/google phones have voice navigation for free! Siri is a joke. One big marketing hype. There's even a lawsuit being filed because the ads are pretty much blatent lies about Siri's effectiveness. HOWEVER it does have voice dictation which makes entering text and email messages extremely easy. The new Ipad NOT having Siri is a big plus for me. The reception on this phone is not as good as my Driod was... not as good as ANY motorola phone I've ever had. The thing Steve Jobs said about users holdign the phone wrong is true. You can bump up the reception of the phone a couple of notched by holding it towards the bottom of the phone only. weird. All in all, well worth the price with some curious minor (for me) negatives.
I love the iPhone 4s very nice fast would want another for my wife
I have owned the iPhone 4S for a month and LOVE it! It feels solid, has a great screen and everything runs fast!
This phone is so much fun. I just love siri. You can find an app for whatever it is that you want. Phone is easy to use and has great graphics. Easy to multitask with.
I have had other smart phones before this is my first I Phone and I will never use any other phone again. You can do everything with this phone. I use Netflix, Internet and the App store is Amazing. I can't say enough about this phone I never have it out of my hands.
I don't use a lot of the features of the I Phone, but I love the ease of use and how easy it is to learn all the ins and outs of the phone.
I looked at several phones before deciding on the iphone. This phone is so easy to operate and has some awesome apps. I love this phone and am glad I took the plunge and upgraded to a smartphone. I read the reviews which seemed to all have battery issues. I use my phone an average amount and the battery has never gone below 50% after a days usage. I plug it in every night and it's ready to go when I wake up. I have had my phone for a month now and keep finding new ways to make it work for me. It is very handy.
I don't care if this does sound like a plug for Apple products, this is the best smartphone available at this time. I have had the misfortune of owning an Android phone as well as using Blackberries in the recent past. The iPhone blows them all away in every area. I do not have the frequent crashes/reboots, bluetooth issues, slowness/unresponsiveness issues, uninitiated calls out the blue, etc. that I had with the Android phone. The iPhone is far more versatile than a Blackberry. I know that no phone is absolutely perfect or not without some issues, but the iPhone so far has lived up to the hype. I am very happy with it and will recommend it to everyone I can. The only real issue is with the price. While I don't believe the 16GB is too high at $199, to move up to 32GB is another $100, and to move up to 64GB is yet another $100. The 32GB should be $250, and the 64GB should be $300, at the most. It simply does not cost Apple or anybody else that much for the added RAM, in my opinion.
The Apple iphone 4s, is so much more than just a phone. It is the gold standard that all will try to imulate.
This phone has been better than I expected. I moved up from the old-school non-smart phone to the iPhone 4s. I could not be happier with my purchase.
I have owned two Droid phones before making the best switch of my life. Everyone should own an iPhone. It is superior in processing power, functionality, user experience, clear screen, apps and everything else. The only thing at all I would change is the ability to make the receiver louder.
My Dad and I went in for the iPhone4s for my sister. She has a horrible habit of texting and driving. Dad has a Motorola Droid 2 that is suppose to have text to speech abilities but is too hard to figure out. and really none of the phone are so user easy to use. She is not a tech geek. Dad and myself yes not here. It has been a month and she is having more fun with that phone. She was complaining the other day about waisting the morning away browsing the app store. Seri is just her best friend, i guess. For someone who is not big into electronics, has had other smart phones. The Apple iPhone is a big hit. user friendly.
I have been a Blackberry user for a long time and never thought I would switch to a iPhone. Well, when the BB crashed I had a decision to make. After hearing many people talk about how they loved the iPhone I thought I would give it a try....My only questions is why did it take me so long... On to the phone review.... SIRI - Ease of use is outstanding, Siri works great as I am driving to write emails or to call someone. It takes a little getting used too but once you get the hang of it you will like it. I found it to work very well with a blue-tooth headset as is seems to understand my words more clearer with less mistakes. Battery - You need to make sure that you are closing out all programs running in the back ground or you will find your battery will not last an 8 hour day, also turn off the WI-FI if you don't need it as this will wear your battery down with-in 2-4 hours. I had to have my 10 yr old show me how to close out the programs since she has a iPod Touch so I will share it with you in case your not sure how to close everything. Once at your main menu push the "menu, main whatever you want to call it button" twice real fast, all your icons will move up and across the bottom it will show you all the programs you have running. Put your finger on just 1 icon and hold it there until you get a negative symbol (about 2 seconds) one each icon, at that point touch each icon that you want to close, once they close they will disappear....Trust me, it does not delete the program or icon off the phone, unless you do this in the main screen then it will.... Speaker/Talking - I find if I am not on my head-set that I need to hold the phone directly to my mouth or the other caller cannot hear me. I have been told several time that it just sounds like I hung up on the other caller when in reality all I did is move the phone away from my mouth. There is a plus to this and that is the noise cancellation works great and people cannot hear what is going on around you. Video's and picture quality are out standing. I have some of the most amazing videos and pictures from my Central America trip just 4 days after I purchased this phone. When I show my pictures people think I took them with some big expensive camera and are blown away when I say that is just from the iPhone. Overall, I really love my iPhone, yes, it has some issue that you learn to deal with just like everything else in the world but the positives out weigh the negatives far more...
Had Android that was OK but wanted to have device that worked smoothly with iPad, Touch 4G and my Macbook Pro. Apps synced smoothly as did music and photos - Concerned about smaller screen but resolution makes up the difference. The best feature of the 4S-- Battery life is much better than anything I've ever had. The courtesy and skill of the BB staff moving contacts and photos made it painless-- Thanks for a pleasurable experience!!
couldn't be more pleased with my iphone works great and the service was great.
For the majority of the time that I have used cellular telephones, I always used an every day, simple-minded phone. Seeing nearly all of my peers with these so-called smartphones eventually tempted me into buying one for myself. This past summer, I asked some of my friends that owned smartphones their opinions on the nifty pieces of equipment; some owned iPhone's while others used Android phones. I eventually made the decision to purchase the iPhone 4 (latest model at the time), mainly because I was already adjusted to the layout having previously owned an iPod Touch. Everything on this miniature Mac is laid out with simplicity. From the settings folder to the "App Store," everything may be accessed with the tap of a finger on the ultra-smooth heat-sensitive screen, and browsed through with a simple flick. The only drawback to this phone, that I have come across, is how fragile it is. With one drop, you may end up with a shattered screen. First and foremost, this phone looks great. I bought the black version, and it is extremely sleek. This phone not only has a great look to it, but it also has a great feel to it. The rectangular, box-like shape fits right into your hand. The iPhone 4 also has a good weight to it. It is not too light to where it feels like a feather in your hand, but it also does not feel like a brick. Apps, apps, apps, and more apps. Did I mention this phone has a plethora of apps? Need an app for something? Well, you are probably in luck because my guess is that Apple's virtual store probably has something to satisfy your needs. Thousands and thousands of games make this phone great for passing time or playing against friends. One of my favorite games is the extremely popular "Temple Run." In this game, you must jump and slide in order to avoid obstacles and to collect coins. Also, the apps made available through the iPhone 4 gives the opportunity to eliminate numerous items from an every day life. No need anymore for a GPS system, magazines, or phonebooks. Even many popular newspapers are now made available with a little searching. I have the ability to check the weather, scores of sports games, my to-do list, and much more with the tap of a finger. My favorite feature of the iPhone definitely is having access to Google whenever I want. Granted, every smartphone has access to a browser, but Google seems to be the most convenient capability offered by my phone. Countless times in conversations will random questions pop up that no one knows the answers to, so now I can just Google it. "What year did they win the championship?" "What album was this song on?" The answers are now in the palm of my hand. If you are clumsy like I am, it would be a wise choice to buy a case for protection against drops and spills. At first, I was weary of buying such a fragile device due to my history of accidents with cell phones. I purchased an Otter Box Defender Series case immediately after receiving my phone, and it turned out to be a great decision. I drop my phone every once in a while and have yet to blemish my actual phone. If someone asked me if they should get an iPhone 4, I would definitely say yes. This phone is so modern and sophisticated. It loads webpages super quick, and it downloads applications lightning fast. The battery outlasts almost all other smartphones and recharges quite rapidly. The iPhone 4 has everything you could possibly need in a phone. I am so pleased with this product that I will now be a lifelong Apple consumer.
Went from a Blackberry to the I Phone, should have done it a long time ago.
Let me start off by saying that I am very tech savy. I've had a couple of Blackberry's and a Droid's before, but no other phone that I have ever had will EVER compare to my iPhone 4S!!! This phone is so user friendly that I would recommend it to ANYONE even someone who doesn't know how to use technology. Its set up was a breeze and its extremely easy to use. I love all of the apps and different features that it comes with. I will NEVER go to any other phone besides an iPhone now!
Great product...It's a must have phone..apple is on top of its game
Waited for years to get a smart phone thinking I really didn't need to spend extra money on data pkg. Then finally decided to spoil myself and bought an iPhone. Can't believe I waited so long!!!!!!!!! Best purchase I ever made. Soooo easy to use. Have had no problem with battery life. Happy Happy Happy.
First - the new iPhone is great, lives up to my expectations and more. My 4 star rating is based on what an awful shopping experience I had trying to get it through BestBuy. I love BestBuy and have had many great shopping experiences there, but this was a nightmare, at three different BestBuy stores. Now - on to the phone. I love Siri and feel the upgrade from my iPhone 3 was a big improvement. The battery runs out far too fast, but I got the Mophie - Juice Pack Air Charging Case a few days later and now never have to worry about battery life.
great device! reall user friendly, a good buy for the everyday user!
Easy to use, perfect for the less tech savvy smartphone user.
The four star rating should probably be 4-and-a-half. To start with the bad: I have not found a use for Siri, the much advertised 'personal assistant' feature. She answers every time I bend over if the phone is in its usual place in my front pocket, but doesn't in the few instances I've tried to use the feature. This all may be my clumsiness. On the other hand, the rest of the iPhone 4S is wonderful. My last phone was an iPhone 3G, and I am delighted with many of the improvements. I have lost none of the functionality of apps, and there is much added. The camera alone is worth changing for: the HD movies are excellent, even in mediocre lighting conditions; the FaceTime option is great (though I have used it only once thus far), and the optics of the still-shot camera continue to impress me: there is no need to take a camera traveling any more! The phone quality is very good, and my wife (who switched from a Samsung) has had none of the problems she had with the keyboards on her last two phones. Our children, now in their twenties, used to laugh at her attempts--now she not only texts them reliably, but also she has even used the phone as a primary email device on a recent trip we took together, leaving me as the only one needing to lug a computer around. Overall, well done.
Love the ease if use and functions the phone offers. As a heads up to all who purchase the phone, if you find your battery is not lasting the day here is the trick. The phone is searching for data all the time and part of the reason I bought the phone was bc programs weren't suppose to be running in the background. But they do!! So you need to hit the square return button twice when your on your homepage. A bottom screen will show with every application you ever used. Hold down on one of those apps for about 2 seconds then hit the red button in the corner to eliminate those and save your battery usage.
This phone does everything that is advertised and more.
I had a Droid X for over a year and loved it, the IPhone is a very good phone it is less buggy then the Droids but I like the Droid better because you can do more when it is Rooted. I got the iPhone because i have all Apple computers and iPads so it just made sense to me. done get me wrong i am not talking bad about the iPhone i just like the droid better
I got this phone for my wife for XMas, and she hasn't been able to put it down!
phone is easy to use, still learning apps, etc. woudl recommend
I love this phone, it's fast and after using SIRI for a little while, I can get about 95% voice to text results. Makes it really easy to text responses and e-mails. The camera is incredible absolutely great pics and movies. I have mine through Verizon who will unlock the SIM card for free so I can use it in other countries by purchasing a local SIM. Sprint said they would however, could not and said they have no plans of ever unlocking the SIM. So back to Verizon I went, used the phone in Hong Kong and Macau without any problems. Great voice, it exceeded my expectations and continues to do so.
I have used several phones over the years (For work & home) but this Apple 4S is by far the BEST, Thanks Best buy
The first phone I got, after waiting one month, I couldn't view pics or listen to my iTunes on it. Apps didn't load. I took it back to Best Buy, and they were nice, but told me to return home and "restore" it on my computer. I did, and nothing improved. I returned to the store, and they ordered me another...it came in after a week and a half. I am very happy with this one. Everything works, and I am having lots of fun with it. The phone also works right. Guess I got a dud the first time.
I love the iphone. This phone allows me to do everything I need to do for work, while also giving me great apps that let me keep up with my family's variuous fire/EMS shifts, add captions to pictures and share them with my friends, track my calories and exercise, and so much more. This is the phone to have if you want to stay connected and enjoy great options for apps!
I've drunk the koolaid. It tastes good.Take me to your leader.
I have had several Droid phones and I will never go back. This was purchased for my wife. It is a great phone with great features. However, I do not think the extra features of the 4s are enough to make me switch from my normal iPhone 4. If you are looking for a new phone I would pick an iPhone 4 (to save money) or the iPhone 4s. This is the Cadillac of phones
I reALLY DO LIKE IT...AND i'M SURE ONCE i GET THE HANG OF IT WILL EVEN LOVE IT MORE....i'M TRYING TO JUST LEARN A FEW THINGS AT A TIME..SO i CAN ACTUALLY REMEMBER
I love most of the features on my iPhone 4s, but the battery life is terrible!! I have to recharge my phone at least three times a day. I did the update that was promised to fix the issue and, if anything, it made it worse! Apple needs to do something to fix this issue immediately!!
After 2 years on Droids, I came back to Apple. Love the phone! Hard to beat interface and operations. Service at Westfield, IN Best Buy store was great, thank you.
I love this phone except for the battery life :( great service !
I had the iPhone 4 for only a few months when I moved up to the 4s. Not too different, but love Siri!!!
The Apple iPhone 4s is smooth and works for you not against you. Love the iCloud. Photo's look good on phone but not quite as good when enlarged on computer. The focus on camera is super fast and haven't missed any desired pictures. I think the voice phone quality is excellent, much better than my old LG phone. The iPhone looks great but why did Apple use glass for the back? I feel like I have to carry it in a vault to protect it. Battery life is short, the IOS 5.01 update didn't change anything for me.
Battery could be better. can't upload photos from camera roll to facebook. alot of limited funtions.
There is a reason that 84% of iPhone users stay with the iPhone on there next upgrade. The technology in this is beyond any other phone. If your looking at the new galaxy nexus phone by samsung don't! That is the cheapest looking phone. The screen is bigger because apple knows that if theirs gets any bigger it would lose resolution and feel. The help at best buy was great. I was told at Verizon that the fastest way was to order a phone that wouldn't come for three weeks. So I called best buy and they had them in stock. Even though their system was down I was done in a half an hour. She set it up and transferred my contacts like that. You need this phone!
Love this phone. I resisted buying a smart phone for years for fear it would be smarter than I am, but I gotta say, this phone is so intuitive to use that I've never needed to read instructions for it. I looked at many Droid phones before settling on this iphone and chose it primarily for its fabulous picture-taking. Many phones boast 8 megapixels, but this phone camera had more clarity than any others I'd seen--and the icloud feature automatically backs up any pics I take to my computer! No dropped calls, sound clarity is fantastic, battery lasts throughout the day, Siri is wonderful--this is just an all-around super phone. Why did I wait so long to venture into the world of smart phones? Maybe cause I'm a grandma who remembers the days when there were NO cell phones at all!
Great camera and speed upgrades! I upgraded from my 2+ year old 3GS and this is a great phone!
More than impressed with Siri . She works better if there's no external noise. By the way this review was entered using the IPhone 4s. The only thing I don't like is the keyboard always shows capital letters. Wish it showed lower case. The update really increases battery life.
I'm still new to this item, so far, enjoying it immensly. Probably have much more to learn about using the internet on this phone.
For many years of my life, I have been using half a dozen products. * Cell Phone * GPS Navigation * iPod Touch * DVD Player * Digital Camera * Digital Camcorder The iPhone 4S is all of those products (plus many more) all wrapped up into one, so let's dive right in, shall we? 1. Cell Phone -- The call quality is incredible. I'll never forget the first phone call I made (from my car) listening to the incredible sound clarity of the call. Also, it has the new Bluetooth 4.0 technology and integrates with my vehicle Bluetooth perfectly. In fact, when I use the voice-activated "Siri Personal Assistant", I speak to my car (not the phone) and Siri understands me. The included earphones includes the speaker, so you can use it hands-free while on the go. 2. GPS Navigation -- With an optional vehicle mount, this will function with the right (optional) application (app). Combined with Siri voice control, this device exceeds my expectations of what to expect from a GPS navigation system. 3. iPod Touch -- The iPhone does everything the iPod Touch can do many times better with a much faster A5 dual-core processor. From listening to your music, to photos, to videos, to web browsing and everything else, you really can carry less and have more. 4. DVD Player -- with the optional A/V adapter combined with an HDMI cable, this has replaced my BlueRay Player for full DVD functionality for a full 1080P HD experience. Popcorn not included. 5. Digital Camera -- Oh sure, it does not have a mega-zoom lens, but it certainly has 8 megapixels, improved sensor for low-light photography, HDR photo technology and when combined with the (optional) Photo stream service with iCloud integration, all photos taken can instantly sync with all of your other Apple devices. With this wireless integration, it also replaces memory cards and those dreadful adapters! Did I mention that it includes two cameras? 6. Digital Camcorder -- Make no mistake about it, this camcorder can record a full 1080P HD video at 30 Frames-Per-Second. With two cameras, there are more opportunities than ever! Now you would think with all of those features, that would be the limit, but truth be told -- there are no limits to what you can do. With the incredible App store, you can purchase additional apps. In fact, many fine apps are actually free of charge. With the wonderful Siri personal assistant, just speak in natural language to do many tasks. Need an alarm clock? Just ask, "Siri, wake me up at 5:30 AM tomorrow". Need an oven timer? Just ask, "Siri, set the timer for 20 minutes". The possibilities are endless with what you can do. This product is just incredible and if you are shopping for someone, looking for a gift, if they already own one, there are dozens of fine accessories that would make affordable gifts, because most people will purchase this long before the holidays. Recommended: Highly
After using Blackberry phones for four years, I decided it was time for an upgrade. I researched all the Android models and they all came up short compared to the iPhone 4s, in terms of speed, sheer reliability, and smooth user interface. Add Siri and iCloud and the near flawless design on the iPhone and I was sold. Good Crackberry and Hello Apple!
Returned my iPhone 4S 32GB after going to apple tech phone line and the store 6 times! The store was useless they just want to give you someone else's rebuilt phone! Until they admit to problem and fix it, I wouldn't waste your money!
Purchased Otterbox defender and Zagg HD shield to protect phone. The iPhone is amazing. Siri makes everything easy!
Bought this for my son for his 14th birthday. It's the 4th iPhone in the house...need I say more?
Faster, better picture quality than my 3S. Underimpressed with Siri though, not nearly as intelligent as Apple would have us believe.
So far a good phone and has been fairly easy when switching from Android to Apple - the verdict is still out as to which is better; they both have good qualities.
I came to the iPhone 4S from the Android Motorola Droid X really really wanting to love this phone. I enjoyed right off the bat how easy the phone was to set up and get done basic tasks, but within a week I was already feeling the limitations. I hated the contact manager. Apple designed it a certain way, and if you don't like Apple's way, well too bad, they wont let developers write apps that replace key functionality items like the contact manager. The lack of basic GPS routing application similar to Google Maps is a major downside for me as well. Sure, you can see a route on the map, but turn by turn directions would be nice as is standard on Android. I also was quite upset that only music and media present in iTunes could be imported to my phone. With android it was always as simple as drag and drop into a mounted file folder or SD card. The final straw for me was the lack of an SD card and the media issues (importing MP3s downloaded from various websites to be used as ringtones is a perfect example) was ultimately a deal breaker. I kept my iPhone for a total of 3 weeks and returned it for a Samsung Galaxy S3 and could not be happier! Sure I didn't get all I wanted with the stock apps on the Galaxy either, but gloriously, Android allowed me to download 3rd party apps to make the experience all that I wanted it to be.
Perfect phone all around. Well worth the money. This is a very dependable phone
being a newbie to the technology of smart phone..i was very happy and surprised that it's so easy to navigate and use. i know there are many more things that i can do with it..just a matter of finding some direction from my kids and the iphone dummies i downloaded. love it!
For someone that has an iPad and up iMac computer this is a great asset! Everything syncs together and works very smoothly. If Mac would just build a touch screen laptop I'd be set!
Was just what I was looking for, didn't think the money was worth it for the iPhone 5 but with the price down on the 4S thought it was a great phone for the money. Only thing is the blue tooth comparability with items, we use a blue tooth printer and scanner at work and will not work with the iPhones ,
I wanted to get i phone5.IT was not available.I was told i could return it to get i phone 5 , and i phone 4S was available. I visited the store 3 times to try to get i phone5 with out luck. Now the window of one month is over. Let me know if you can help in any way?
Have to recharge more often than my previous phone (IPhone 4).
I really like the phone over all. I am disapointed in the battery life and the charger didn't work after 6 weeks. The charger has no warranty!
I don't know what I did without Siri. I can not only have her remind me of things that need to be done, but she can text for me and read me my incoming texts.
My family Loves the IPhones!! Recommend them to everyone!
Omg, I should've got this phone when it first came out. I've been using android for which seems like forever compared to the 4s. Everything works smoothly and I haven't had to reboot, reset, or anything to this phone. Goodbye android for good!
Love the phone, not carzy about Verizon but the phone is great. I am still learning all the tricks you can do with the iPhone. But all in all it is a really good phone
I bought this phone because I am used to Apple products and I was afraid to go with the android system. What a mistake. The reception on this phone stinks. I have been into the store multiple times and I just got off the phone with customer service again. Customer service tried to troubleshoot over the phone and now my iPhone is even worse than it was before he did the troubleshoot. I have had nothing but trouble since day one. Do not buy the iPhone. It is not worth the money. I also have 2 family members with the same exact problems and I have informed Verizon about this.
Nice style, thin and slick buttons. Thought it was going to be hard to get use to all the different features but it was not. Not really a computer person but this is easy
She loves the phone and can't understand why she waited so long to obtain it. the features are great; the phone just is a great new purchase
Great Phone! I love iPhones more than Androids. The only downside is that the iPod app does not work very will with my car stereo.
I was looking into a case that was smaller and less bulky. But this case offers little to no protections against accidental drop phone. Also its not worth the price I paid for a piece of thin plastic...
This is a good durable case that is not too bulky.
I bought this case with the bundle when we upgraded. I am not very hard on phones so I didn't need to get the most expensive case there was. I found that this case isn't bulky and it doesn't look cheap. The only bad thing about it is that if you do drop it on the concrete, it will scrape. It was a simple drop and I got 4 sizable scrapes on the corners. I can't complain too much since it didn't shatter my glass. Overall it does the job of protecting what it's covering. It just may have a few more battle scars
I was looking for a case that was not as bulky as otter boxes but would still offer some moderate protection. I have never dropped a phone, but wanted that :just in case" security. The only choices of colors was blue or brick red. Wish there were more choices of color.
Looks good and fits well, Good protection. have dropped phone more than once without problems, Easy to install
This product is excellent for protecting your I-Phone 4 against dropping or normal day-to-day wear. Unfortunately for some reason the car charger will not stay plugged in due to design.
I bought this case recently as I needed a new case for my iPhone 4. A few days into having the case, I went to the pool and touched the case a few times while my hands were still wet. The paint immediately started bubbling and peeling off, and has been falling off in flakes since then. Definitely not worth the money. Don't bother.
This is a 5 STARS PLUS item. I will and have already recommended it to others.
I use my iphone 4 extensively for GPS applications such as Geocaching, SkyDroid (for Golf) etc. The iphone 4 battery last a lot longer than the iphone 3 battery but would still not last more than 2 to 3 hours of continuous GPS use. So after doing a lot of research I decided on the Mophie Juice Pack Plus and was very impressed. Fits great and looks great. I did not even perform a charge on it before using it on a golf outing that lasted 6 hours and the battery never went down at all!!!
i love this case because it is camo and i hunt i also love this case because it is very potective
GREAT PHONE JUST WISH IT WAS NOT SUCH A PAIN TO DOWNLOAD MUSIC . AND DIFFERENT TONES OH AND SCREEN WAS A BIT LARGER
I have always been opposed to getting an iPhone since it came out because of the whole issue of not displaying flash. I actually got this phone for my wife as her birthday present. Once I got it, I started checking out the features and I must say, I am very impressed with how long Apple has come from the first iPhone that was released. I have always been an Apple person and now that I know that the iPhone is as good as it is right now, I am definitely getting one when my contract is up for renewal. The best part about it is how this phone, along with all the other Apple products integrate with each other.
I love my iPhone 4S. I upgraded from a BlackBerry and am totally hooked to the iPhone. I thought the transition from BlackBerry to iPhone would be hard, but it wasn't. The touch keyboard was a little hard getting use to, but once you get the hang of it, you can type fast like with a regular qwerty keyboard. I love the many apps I can get. Downloading is fast. I just wish that group text replies where private like on my old BlackBerry. On the iPhone, the whole group can see your replies, so if you want privacy, you can't do group text. But that's no big deal. If you want privacy, just text individually even if it is the same text message. I just copy & paste to everyone individually so that the replies can come just to me & no one else. I love my iPhone. I have no regrets.
I have been waiting to purchase the iPhone ever since Sprint started offering them. I was a previous blackberry owner before I made the switch. I thought I had a smartphone with the blackberry, that is until i picked up my new iPhone. Very easy ot set up and it is like a mini-computer in my hand.
I got this phone because my wife has been wanting an iPhone for a long time. She had an Android phone prior, and was really excited to get this phone. She used it for awhile and the network was really slow!! It seemed even slower than when she used her Android. She totally fell in love with Siri!!!! Problem was, Siri was horrible when on our carrier network. And after awhile she missed her big Android screen, widgets, her Google Play Music app, and being able to customize her phone more. The iPhone 4S is a really great phone, but it turned out to not be what she really wanted. We took it back and got a Samsung Galaxy S III. We are really enjoying that now, and only missing Siri!
Great phone! I like it and I have had it for about a month now and has been pretty good to me
Overall this seems to be a great phone. It is very fast online and fairly simple to navigate.
If you don't own one, go get one. The phone anticipates what I would like to get done.
My previous 2 phones were androids and, well, like most androids they let me down. So eventually I received my iPhone as a gift. I have to say this phone is great. This phone is faster than any android. The operating system is better. The phone is better overall. All I have to say is that I'm an apple fanboy now.
I was reluctant to give up my android phone but gave in to reviews and decided to give this phone a try. It has a few more bells and whistles than the Android phone I had. It seems to work smoother and faster. The battery lasts twice as long compared to the Android phone I had. The phone could be damaged very easily so plan to spend the extra money and get a really good protective case. It has an awesome camera and linked to iCloud it's even better. It also seems to pick up a signal where my Android didn't.
I love this phone, won't go back to a droid ever again!
I'm not very technologically gifted but this phone is incredibly easy to understand and set up. If you are going to buy this product youve got to order the model with Siri. Jetsons anyone?
I love my iPhone, I can have my phone, music and all my apps on one device and I'm also able to save and update my info through my iTunes account, I will never have to worry about losing any of my contacts or pictures again.
The phone is very intuitive, but the battery life is a serious problem.
I had thought about just buying a droid phone with my upgrade, but decided to splurge on the Iphone. I am so glad I did. I love the I cloud feature also.
I've bought 6 phones plus tvs and other items from Best Buy. When I purchased the iPhone I had your people install the shield. When I reviewed my invoice I noticed I was charged for this. I was never charged a fee in the past. I should have been told at time of purchase. It was my mistake for not seeing it on my receipt . I'll have to be more careful at best buy from now on
Purchased to replace my teenage daughters Blackberry. She loves it. No problems with phone or service.
My first Apple iPhone 4 I purchased 6 months ago. Loved it but really wanted Siri. I purchased my second iPhone 4s 16gb one month later. Gave my other iPhone 4 to my daughter. I have not regretted the purchase at all. My daughter says she has had problems with the iPhone 4 but I never did. iPhone 4s is one of the best phones I have ever owned. Make sure to buy a case with it for the protection of being dropped. And definatly buy the black tie protection through Best Buy. It may be a little more expensive but well worth it.
The iPhone 4S certainly doesn't need my review in order to tell you it's great. A legion of fans does that pretty effectively. This being my first iPhone, however, lets me confirm to myself how wonderful it really is. Everything from the sleek metal case to the crystal clear display (seriously, I didn't know my eyes could even see things that sharp!) represent one of the finest designed, and most elegant, products I've ever held in my hand. The interface is logical, slick, and plenty fast for my needs. So far, the apps I've downloaded have all worked well, from camera apps, to games, to a Bible reader, and much in between. After hearing all the positive vibes surrounding the iPhone pretty much since it was released, to have one now in my hands is indeed a revelation. And I haven't even mentioned how much I love this camera... I will say the battery life could be improved.
The iPhone4 is real easy to use and has a lot of options.
My first Smart phone, and i love it.. Haven't really found anything I don't like..Easy to use. I would recommend this to a beginner like me..
Physical Attributes: o This device is too thin, as it seems too easy to be dropped. o Glass is not a practical for this device. o Display size should have been 3.75" to 4". o Function buttons & the data port are located in optimal areas. o Apple's connector is too bulky. o This device is beautiful, but fragile! An Otterbox Defender case or Griffin Survivor case is an absolute necessity. Operational Attributes: o The processing power is far superior of any device I have ever used/owned! The responsiveness of the fluid interface & menu operations is smooth & fast. o I hate virtual keyboards. But this keyboard works much better than any other virtual keyboard. It is almost as easy to work with as a physical keyboard. o The 8mp camera is absolutely amazing! It takes high quality pics & snaps them fast. o Reception is great. This is most likely due to the fact this device is not running Verizon software. o Customization options of this device are great. The ability to determine which apps can use push-notifications improves performance & battery life. This also helps control data usage too. o Siri is definitely beta. It is obvious that Siri has much more limitations that one would first think. o The speakers leave much to be desired if you are playing your music over the speakers. Do not plan on being impressed or you will be disappointed. o Apple = No Flash. If you do not plan on using this device as a primary device for internet browsing, then this should not be a deal-breaker. Battery life: o Battery life is great! I can usually get two days easy on a full charge, but I don't "play" with my device 12 hours a day either. o The recharge time for this device is faster than anything I have ever seen. Conclusion: I have had my iPhone 4s for 2.5 months now. But if I had to redo my purchase decision again I would buy it again. As long as you get a good protective case & take care of it, it is an awesome device. I have not experienced any freeze-ups or hang-ups. The battery life & the processing power of this device makes up in part for the bad design of this device. The lack of a physical keyboard kept me buying android phones for a long time, but the constant Android problems, like freeze-ups made me want to give the iPhone a try. And now, I am very glad I did.
Used the EVO 4G for 2 yrs with a variety of problems with hardware & software issues starting from day 1. This is a huge step up from the EVO. NO problems so far.
First, I must mention that Siri is a nice feature but is not efficient as I had hoped and with Sprint's network sometimes tends to lag when using 3g to download data. However, the A5 processor is incredible and can multitask apps with ease. The iSight camera is works well. The 8 megapixel camera is great and is better than you would expect from a smartphone camera. iOS is a incredible operating system, the notification center, iMessage, reminders, and iCloud are some of the best features in the market. The battery is pretty decent but beware of apps that are being run in the background they can kill the battery.
I love having the option of so many popular apps! I've found apps that are compatible with my phone that help me with my finances, fitness, as well as just fun game type apps. Its seems like almost every popular app is compatible with this phone. Another benefit I've found from this phone is that is syncs better with my Macbook than my previous phone (a Blackberry). I don't want to spend hours trying to make sure that my important information is backed up, so having a compatible phone and computer was essential to me when making my purchasing decision. I appreciate its simplicity and ease of use. The only thing I've found difficult to adjust to is the small touch screen keyboard. I find I rely heavily on the auto correct when I text. Maybe if you've already used a touch screen for typing it would be easier to master the iPhone keyboard.
Not as fast as I had hoped and Siri could be better at being available, but over all I really like my iPhone 4s. I have had Blackberries for about 4 years and love them, but I wanted more freedom with surfing and apps. I am quite surprised at how easy the touch screen is to type on (and I have not had a "D@mn you autocorrect" moment yet). I have had the phone about a month and I would recommend it to others. Battery life is not great, but there are products that help to overcome that issue.
I'm so happy with my new iPhone. I've told co-workers to get the iPhone when it's time to get a new phone.
Good bye android. How did I survive without this phone? Love it. Siri is not what she was hyped up to be. But so what? It's fast and has storage. Great phone. I was a skeptic. No regrets. Should have done it sooner
love My phone however I would have done things a little different. The phone is great but goes through battery power pretty quick. Wtih HEAVY usage I am charging it 2-3 times in 24 hours. Normal usage 1 time every 12 hours. While I bought the 4S because of Siri. I wouldn't spend the money for it a second time around....it only understands you about 50% of the time. But it is a cool feature for finding things (restaurants/ coffee shops) around town. The phone on the 3g network is slow! If your not in a hurry it is not a problem. Otherwise I love this phone!
I have been an Android user for more than 4 years, and after getting the iPhone 4s. I feel like I have been wasting my time using an android phone. I know you will get more free apps on the android than the iPhone but, trust me the iPhone is worth the money. texting, facebooking, emailing, twitting or anything else in relation to the keyboard is pleasant and smooth. I will admit that without wifi my HTC EVO is way fast that the iPhone but I really love the feel and touch of the 4S. The picture quality is wonderful unbelievable. The battery life is amazing. Buy the phone if you can will not regret it.
Loving every minute of this phone and all of it's features.
The iPhone 4S is completely easy to use. I am really happy with all of the apps available on the phone when I purchased it.
As above--really nice, sleek device. I had a Palm Pre that was ahead of the I-phone 3. But the I-phone came forward while the Palm expired. The I-phone 4s does more than I need it to do, fits in my pocket easily, and works well--including navigation.
Had trouble with charger. Had to replace it twice but the phone is great
I switched from an EVO to the iPhone on Sprint because I wanted the convenience of iTunes for my music and the better camera. I found the android OS easier to use then the Apple OS but but not enough to matter ( I hate having to sign in to the app store everytime I download something). The one thing I miss is the larger display that the EVO had. Overall the 4s is pretty good phone and I really like having all my playlist and music available on my phone in the same format as my PC and ipod which I can now retire.
switched from my android to the I-phone....at this time still not convinced its better than but had less than a month. Major thing is the battery life is much longer than the android phone.
This is my first iphone and smartphone. Overall I am happy except for a few glitches that my phone is having. A couple of times it did not end the call and tried to for 10 hours. Also, my imessages do not work anymore. I had to switch to texts just so i could text my boyfriend. I am not a tech savvy person but it is fairly easy to navigate through all of the apps and settings. I love having SIRI! That is helpful except when it gives me the wrong number for a business. The battery life isn't that bad. I charge it on my way to work and on my way home.
My evo 4g was faster! I like to customize my phone my way! Taking back today and will wait for new lte line of phones to be made available from sprint. I am Andriod user! Dont get me wrong I phone is great i just like to have more options!
Moving up from a Samsung that served its purpose well. I love all my new functionality and my situation where I am moving around like a gypsy temporarily has made this purchase seem a no brainer. The only complaint is that I have so much to learn that I can do with this phone. I kill batteries fast so I bought the Mophie and love it too, I highly suggest it also. With the Mophie the phone is a little heavy but I can go 3 days on one charge and my daughters needs charged everyday without the extra battery capacity.
It is a decent phone. Definitely more reliable than any droid I have owned. Not as many options and not as user friendly as the 3D but a better overall product. I actually have two of them now, one for work and one for personal. I would suggest it if you are not too concerned with customization.
I had this phone for over a month and so far it has been better than my previous androids. The Data speed is "Average" unless you compare it with another Iphone on the ATT network, but nowdays there is free wifi everywhere and the phone connects automatically once you configure it. I had gone running (on an open area) listening to the Iheart radio app on the 3g network and the connection is 98% constant, very few buffering issues. Not the same with videos on 3g. they just take forever( if they load). Call quality is very good and the interface is excellent. Even the free GPS navigation apps works thru your car's bluetooth system. The battery does not last one day if you use it a lot so you need to carry around an extra cable to plug it in on a computer or a charger. I had many phones on the Sprint network since 1997 and this is the best phone I have ever had.
This phone is more than just a phone. It does soooo much more and I'm learning something new about it everyday. I have had my Iphone 4s for a month today. It's so easy to use, it is not complicated at all. It takes amazing pictures. If you are looking for a phone, camera, computer and so much more than I highly suggest you look into this one. :-)
This phone allows you to do so much! You really don't know the capabilities until you own one and search all of the apps available!
This is my first iphone. I do own one of the first ipod touch that they came out with so I really didn't have any problem navigating around the phone. The internet connections fast, all my apps work great, and there are more features on this phone than the previous cell phone I had. I would recommend this phone to any 1.
The phone itself is a bit blocky to me. It is pretty, easily handled, and simple to use. One must really appreciate apple to use it though. I am an android person and passed the phone on to my husband who loves apple. The sound and use is good on this device. the wifi picks up easily. I did experience a lot of dropped and lost calls with using this phone. It also would not always connect calls, and delivered messages at a delayed time lapse.
I like having the most power I can get in the smallest package I can. The iPhone seemed like the way to go - However the phone is so fragile that you have to get a case for it that makes it larger than other phones that could have survived without a case. Plus I hate iTunes. Apple has nice features but something that you carry everywhere with you should be a little more sturdy IMO. Back to Samsung and Droid i go.
This is one of the best phones I have purchased in to years. Applications can be synced with the IPAD and that works for me.
I'm enjoying the phone and all the many features and apps. However, even with the IOS 5.1 update, I'm still one of the many that is having an issue with the battery life drainage. Otherwise, it would be a 5-star rating.
I love everything about my new I phone4gs except the life of the battery is does not last long enough to enjoy all the features
Everything about this phone is kind of amazing. The only gripes I had about this phone is that it still runs on 3G speed (I own an HTC EVO 3D which is a 4g phone) and the iPhone simply cannot compete with the networking capabilities of 4g. The only way to have a juiced up iphone experience is if youre running on a fast wifi network at home or work. So with that being said, hopefully the next gen iPhone will be 4g capable. Second gripe about the phone, is that it does not allow your phone to become a voice guided gps navigatior while driving around town. I travel daily and it's not as convenient as some of the android phones that utilize google navigation to help guide you around the congested freeways of southern california. Third, is Siri. It's a cool feature, but does not always work the way you want her to. Sometimes it's faster just to do the tasks yourself, like typing out a text msg or doing an online search. Siri is helpful though when your hands are full and when there isn't a lot of background noise. All in all it's still a pretty awesome phone to own when you do the overall comparisons to what is out there!
Really no more need be said. It runs so smooth its been 3 months since Ive purchased and Im still annoying friends telling them how much I still love my phone. The improved optics on the camera were the main selling point for me. This phone with its camera and applications can truly turn anyone into an amateur photographer. Siri is a great assistant and shes wonderful at scheduling appointments and reminders and dictating text. Im at worl right now so cant continue but this phone is worth absolutely every penny. If youre buying with Best Buy PLEASE be sure to get the protection plan. 15 dollars a month sounds pricey...but it covers EVERYTHING (except loss or theft). And you can replace your phone anytime you need with no deductible.
It didn't turn into a jet and fly me anywhere, it doesn't print money, but it does have the more GBs and the Wi-Fis, so it has to be awesome. Seriously, if you need a review for an iPhone, you shouldn't be buying a phone. Go buy two cans and a string and save the world the hassle.
I have been a loyal droid user for the past few years, and I swore I would never cross to the darkside. However I have had the phone for a month and I have purchased a Mac Book, Apple TV and about $500 worth of sounds and Apps. I love it! It is well worth the investment. And Best Buy is the best place for your transaction. The service is paramount and they are knowledgeable and about everything. It is also nice to go to a place that is deverse. They sell for all the carriers so that they are able to set up a carrier that is best for you.
This is my first iPhone and I am underwhelmed. I came from Blackberry and thought this was going to be a significantly better experience. It is not. Web browsing is considerably better on the iPhone but the keyboard and durabiltiy of the BB make up for that. Also with a BB you can have a spare battery to keep you going when you travel. Siri is TERRIBLE. it only works about 50% of the time.
game apps can become addictive and Siri can be a little tempermental.
The phone is all i hoped it would be and the service although it took long to get the a representative was good also
I just luv it no problems as of date happy with my purchase
Finally joined the iPhone world with the new 4s. Great phone, great display and camera. The only hiccup I've found is that Siri is either still in Beta or the system is just getting overloaded with users. There are times when I get the "I'm sorry, I can't assist you at this time" message. Irritating on one of the premier features on the new iPhone.
I love this phone has soooo many features, i love the camera and also the video..
I cannot find anything wrong about this phone aside from the high phone bills. It is a pricey phone to own over other phones
I was debating between the iPhone and 2 Driods. My deciding factor was that I have an apple laptop as well and the two link up wirelessly when they are within range. I see a lot of negative reviews about the life of the battery. When I first got my phone, and didn't know how to use any of the features, the battery lasted about 5 days. But now that I use it a lot more, it needs to be charged every 2 days. There was only one day that the battery ran down and I was home sick using it all day long. So I would say battery life is good. Everything else is amazing on the phone. I have also found issues with buying accessories, esp the car charger. I was told my iPod charger would work but it does not. Online you can see reviewed of how chargers have fried people's phones and stuff. Makes it scary. So far, I have not located a charger for my car which is compatible.
My biggest concern is the life of the battery. If I have everything working than the battery goes down in about six hours. I disable wifi and Push than it will last all day. I dont use it very often but if I need to, than I worry that it will shut down in the middle of a conversation
i my opinion i phone is behind in tech new samsung gl II is smarter than ipnone so i return iphone that is my opinion
I bought this for my husband because he had an Android phone and was intimidated by it. He could never figure out how to do anything but make calls because every time he tried, there were so many options that he just got frustrated and gave up. This phone is so intuitive that I hardly had to help him at all! I watched in amazement as he figured out on his own how to make calls, go through his contact list, send a text and take pictures, all within minutes of setting it up. Now he even plays Words With Friends, checks the weather, and uses the calendar, which I've synced with my phone.
When I bought the iPhone 4s I was immediately blown back by it's deign and features. It has great specs and a brilliant screen. Coming from an android phone, I was use to the optional customizing offered on it's system but I had to bite that bullet. The 4s is a great device with a great battery, cool iOS, an amazing array of accessories, and comes with dynamic support from it's retailers.
i couldnt wait to get my hands on the new iphone since i never had one before but , when i got it i wanted to return it the phone suck seri sucks. You have to pay for everything it has like a million aps but u have to pay for them all so whats the point.. Cant wait till my wife upgrade is up so i can get the samsung Galaxy s2 and give her this paper weight...
When I bought this, it was to see if it could help my wife and I more organized, we had just bought her an iPad 2. We both have rotating shifts and Dr's appointments and kids. We always had trouble keeping up with things. I bought it and linked it with her iPad and they work like magic!! I've read that a lot of don't like the battery life, I've found it to be better than my android that I had. I had a Samsung Epic 4g and this blows it away, way more apps and it processes faster (imo) Siri doesn't always work the best, if your reception is shotty, but she is entertaining. It amazes me how well it understands what I'm saying. The $750 is a bit steep but if your looking to consolidate a lot of information, switch to Mac.
I switched from the android platform and have NOT looked back one bit. You will be completely satisfied with this phone ...
I waited a long time for iPhone to be available for Sprint. It's easy to use, the screen is easy to read, has good phone quality and coordinates with my me/iCloud account. It's much easier to text/message than my old smartphone. I don't use Suri much, but it seems to work well. I can't think of a single thing about this phone that I don't like.
I've been an android user for the last 4 years. Finally, I have crossed over to the darkside. I don't care about not being able to personalize my phone down to the kernel it is using. The iPhone is perfect the way it is..not to mention an excellent camera for someone who is trying to make photography their profession. I am forever an iPhone user now.
I had a Black berry, then HTC eve, but this iPhone 4s blow's them both out of the water.
This is my first smartphone and I really like it, it is everything I thought it would be
I love that you offer up to date products and the wireless service that accommodates them.
I never had a iPhone before and was worried about the ability to color code all my businesses in the calendar. But I found out you can have numerous calendars that all coordinate together. Texting is a snap, and getting to email, facebook etc., has been easy too. I still have more to learn about the phone and love it. I just found the voice memo feature to be really helpful when I don't have time to write things down.
Best phone I have ever had , it would be nice if it was 4G
I AM STILL LEARNING ALL THE STUFF YOU CAN DO WITH THIS PHONE. OVER ALL I DO LIKE IT. AS FAR AS USER FRIENDLY I WOULD GIVE IT A 80% CAN'T ADJUST ALOT OF SETTINGS AND SIRI ONLY WORKS WHEN SHE WANTS TO. IT DOESN'T LET YOU PAUSE A BIT IN BETWEEN WORDS. NEVER UNDERSTANDS ME. AND I SPEAK CLEARLY. I DO LOVE THE MUSIC I CAN PLAY.
replaced 2 very high rated Android phones with 4Ss. - should have done it sooner - best phones we have owned. Better battery life, memory management, no stupid apps using up memory and iCloud is awesome.
This phone is awesome. I am a prior Blackberry user. This is my first iphone and i am thoroughly impressed with its ability to display content and sink through the cloud. The Siri application is great and intuitive but sometimes unavailable for search questions. This may have something to do with the network that I am using. (Sprint) It is not as business savvy as my past phones but overall very functional. Facetime is great as I bought my daughter one on the same day that I purchased mine. She loves it! Now.... Apple has to do something about the battery life. It is horrendous! I am not a heavy phone user and I find that even with light to moderate use, the battery will die within 6 hours or so for me. I have tried to follow suggestions online to extend the life but to no avail. This is the major fault for this phone. If you have a charger in your car, office, and on your night stand you will be fine. You will probably not be happy with as many times as you will have to plug the phone in though. Overall I will still say that this is one of the best phones that I have owned, but i am not happy with the battery.
I wasn't due for an upgrade and paid full price for the phone, and I don't regret it at all, I love this phone. I have it for sprint
Came from an HTC Evo 4G. Wanted to see what all the fuss was about. *Calls quality & internet speeds aren't any better than HTC Evo *Phone looks very attractive & build quality is alot better than HTC Evo, but I hate the idea of having glass on both side of the phone. *Picture & video quality is significantly better than HTC Evo *Siri works great but I have real friends and don't see myself using it *Battery life is horrible *Lots of app and games but lacks productive apps *Hate the idea that it needs to be plugged into the computer and itunes for almost anything upgrades/transfer/etc *Virtual keyboard is alot more accurate and responsive than the HTC Evo *Missing lots of features that should be standard on all smartphone *Very limited on both hard and software Bottomline - Phone is very basic and is great for new or novice end users but its not for me. I'm a poweruser and needs the advance/fine tuning option. Switched to a Samsung Galaxy S II Touch and loving it.
Today I will be reviewing the IPhone 4s for Sprint but also came out for Verizon and AT&T. This is the newest and best iPhone to date. The real question here is it worth spending hundreds of dollars to upgrade and get it. The new IPhone come to a dual core processor, which larger than its predecessor. It runs iOS 5, which comes with Siri apple's new voice recognition software. It is a 3g phone and not 4g like most new phones on the market. It also comes with an 8-megapixel camera. It comes with 16, 32, or 64 megabytes of memory The new dual core processor works great with the iOS 5. When using apps there is almost no load time. It moves from screen to screen flawlessly with no delay. It is so smooth. Even though it uses 3g instead 4g like all of its competitors, apple came out with new antenna that manages to provide 4g like speeds. This combined with the dual core processor makes the phones increditably fast. I owned an HTC Evo 4g before I got the IPhone and when I compared the internet speeds they were almost the same, the Evo was a little bit faster. The iOS 5 comes with Siri which apple has put a lot of money into. Sire is by far the best voice recognition software I have ever used. The best part about is there is no phrase you have to use. You can just ask it a question like you would ask a person, it will understand you so you do not have to change how you talk to it compared when you talk to a regular person. The new 8-megapixel camera is great. It also have optical zoom instead of digital zoom, which is what most phones have. Besides taking beautiful pictures the software that it comes with it makes it easy to crop your photos and removing red eye. Battery life, which has always been a problem with the IPhones has been fixed. When pushed extremely hard the battery with last about a full days use. With regular use it can last more than two days with a full charge. Of coarse when you buy an IPhone you get the app store, which is awesome. You also get a built iPod that is really nice and that way you only need to carry one device. The new IPhone is great but does have a few problems. It does have 4g capabilities, which is not as good as its competitors. It is also expensive, it cost two hundred dollars when you sign up for two year contract and goes up another 100 dollars when you add more memory. When compared to the regular Iphone 4 there is not enough changes really for somebody to upgrade. However when compared to the other IPhones, the 3g and 3gs, you should defiantly make the upgrade. When compared to other top of the line phones on the market the IPhone stacks up pretty good, it does not have a real keyboard which is important to some people, it also does not have as large screen as other at three and half inches. All in all if you contract is up and your looking for a new phone I would go with the IPhone 4s.
This review is for those who, like me, had not made the move to "smartphones" yet, living quite contently with basic call & text functionality. My old phone was starting to fall apart, and I was at a fork in the road. What got me to cross over, and "drink the Kool Aid", was actually related to the audio side -- as an Airplay controller. I have a Denon AVR with Airplay, and 2 Apple TVs in other rooms -- but nothing was tying them together. With this phone and the Remote app, I have iTunes controlled for the entire house, including the patio, with a device which is usually in my pocket anyway! I was not prepared for how cool all of the other features would be -- and wonder how/why I waited so long to check these out! This is truly an amazing device -- an excellent camera, very slick texting (not going to miss waiting a few seconds to click a number key 3 times to get one letter!!), the built-in ipod, and the apps...incredible! Even itunes sounds better than with my ipod Classic, must be a better DAC? I haven't done much yet with Siri -- too many other features to get comfortable with first, but it may have some merit down the line. Only negative seems to be that the battery needs to be charged way too fast -- might be because I have too much turned on, but seems to be a common theme in reviews. BTW, I got an OtterBox after seeing a friend's phone after a drop! Great product -- and though I'd resisted going "all in" with Apple over the years, I must admit that they make really good stuff. I'm a believer now!
I recieved my iPhone 4S last friday and I wanted to wait a couple of days before I created a review on it. This phone is at the top of the line of great smartphones. The camera takes stellar photos, Internet is fast, and the battery life lasts throughout the day. Compared to my HTC Evo 4G that I've had for about a year before I received this phone, the battery life comparisons are ridiculous. The iPhone blows the HTC Evo out of the water. Incredible phone.
THIS IS A TOP NOTCH PHONE IPHONE 4S & SPRINT ROCK YOU CANT CANT BETTER THAN THIS EVERYTHING YOU WANT OR NEED IN A PHONE IS HERE ITS JUST SIMPLE A MUST HAVE NUFF SAID!!
This phone is a step up from my blackberry. It is very easy to use and having the ability to use the cloud for storage is great. The only problem is battery life. With the ability to do so much it drains the battery.
This is a great phone. My Droid Incredible on Verizon could not get a signal in my house. This Sprint phone gets full bars in house. Also the 3G is pretty fast but not blazing. The long wait for a pre-order was horrible, but the phone was worth the wait. Really like Siri!
Those that were hoping for a completely different phone from Apple this year, are probably going to be disappointed with the iPhone 4S - especially those who already have an iPhone 4. For the rest of us, we get one of the best phones on the market. I have been an Android user for the last two years, and I am loving the 4S. The operating system is very slick and streamline, and is crystal clear on the gorgeous screen. The upgraded chip allows you to watch videos in full HD - even Netflix now streams select programming in HD over Wi-Fi. Playing games is also enhanced, with the graphics being taken to the next level, as well as flawless gameplay. I played Real Racing 2 and Fifa '12, both of which were an absolute pleasure. Of course, the 8MP camera looks amazing, with a very fast start up time - taking pictures is very snappy, which makes it easier to capture that moment. Video is smooth and clear, with no pixelation, and colors snap on the screen. I just wish there was an HDMI port to plug straight into a TV. The introduction of iCloud is what really won me over. It allows you to back up pictures, movies and documents (up to 5GB for free). Also, if you use iTunes for music (even TV shows), iCloud can download your purchases to the device when connected to Wi-Fi or data. Plus, the upcoming iTunes Match will allow you to potentially play all of your music on your phone, not just what you have previously purchased on iTunes. Those wanting to know about Siri should be pleased to know that it works as advertised. The personal voice assistant is great for using in the car, for sending/reading text messages, setting appointments or reminders, and even playing a certain song from your music library without having to navigate the menus. Other than that, it's been helpful gathering information for my kids' homework! Overall, I am very pleased with my iPhone 4S. There are too many features to cover here, so I mostly touched upon the improvements from the iPhone 4. Those wanting to upgrade from the 4 might want to reconsider, unless you really want a better HD video experience and superior gameplay. Those getting their first iPhone or are upgrading from the 3 or 3GS, should definitely go for it. The only thing I would like to see is a faster data connection, as 3G has been a bit of a step back from HSPA+ on T-Mobile.
I am glad i purchased the Iphone. The GPS function helped me to arrive safely from my trip to Orlando Florida, and back home. Siri is very helpful too, great addition. My children like her assistance. If I had anything negative to say about the Iphone, it would be that whenever i taking photos, i can't make the object closer if i am a far distance. Also, while video taping, i can get the photo closer. But overall, i am pleased with my purchase.
I bought my iPhone in May this year and It's now August and I'm still loving it. I'm not near as frustrated with it as I was my Evo. Great product.
Much fewer quirks than all my previous Droids. Don't like that I can't customize it as much though. Sound quality is not as good but that may just be my Lifeproof case. Love it over all!!
I was hesitant to replace my Galaxy Nexus S 4G with an iPhone 4s, but at my daughter's insistence, I jumped in. Best phone I've ever owned. Great size, incredible battery life and don't get me started on the apps! Practical and entertaining all in one high quality package. Gotta give props to Apple, they know quality!
Great phone. Never considered anything but an android. I love android phones but they have gotten way to big for my taste. I phone gave me the size i like, the memory and also the ease of navigation. I am very pleased with my purchase
Nice phone, some times slow in txt but that's a service issue.
I am very happy so far with my IPhone. Going from a Blackberry to the IPhone is a world of difference. The quality, capability and apps are impresive for my uses. I am not a supporter of Apple by any means but they did a good job with this. Like I said the price is a little hefty but is comparable to other smart phones.
I resisted getting an iPhone after suffering with an AndroidOS phone (Samsung Epic 4G), I broke down and picked this up. I've found it to be a great overall smart phone. It's definitely more robust than the Epic I had prior to this. No system crashes, no reboots required, better and more apps. As a photographer, I'm astounded by the quality of the onboard camera. The iPhone is an all around win. The phone's sound quality is even better. I thought I'd miss having a physical keyboard but have managed to adapt pretty quickly. On the downside, while the battery life is MUCH better than the Epic's, it could be better (probably true of all smartphones, though). I'm also amazed that there isn't a turn by turn navigation app built in. Although I did find a great free app in the App Store, it's not integrated into the contacts, calendar, etc as a native app could be.
Good phone but battery runs out way to fast when my husband has the same phone and an iPhone 4 and both last a lot longer.
overall I'm pleased with the phone. has plenty of options that come in handy
I had the 3GS then switched to a android phone with the larger screen but when my upgrade came up I switched back because of the reliability of the iPhone and the large number of neat stuff like docks and radar detectors and such for it.
I switched over from a Droid and absoultely do not regret my decision. The IPhone is so much easier to use and get familiar with. The battery life goes fairly quick, however the recharge time is unbelievably fast.
I had a Sprint HTC Slider 4G. I rarely got 4G. The battery life was short, couldn't get rid of the 'crapware,' and it always had to be booted. The Iphone 4s is running great, no crapware, no software snafus. I might even ditch my Windows PC and go the Mac way.
I waited until the iPhone 5 came out to get the 4S at a lower price. I had an HTC Hero and found it limited my ability to load applications with it's limited on board memory. The iPhone is a great device and has all of the features I'm looking for in a smart phone. Features make it easy to create an event or add a contact.
I had a blackberry for 3yrs and was just not happy with the slow internet speed and using the phone keypad was hard to see.The apps that were around for this phone really were nothing much. I waited for the i phone 5 to come out and saved $100 the next day.This phone the 4s is just great .Easy to use and tons of apps I think my wife might get one of these when she gets her nails shorter to use the touch screen
I get mad at it when it drops calls and I just want to smash it.
I chose the iPhone 4S over the iPhone 5 and I love the decision I made. I upgraded from a Samsung Replenish so anything was better than that phone. This phone has a great retina display, takes great pictures and videos, and uploads apps really fast. I need to use my phone all day at work (10 hrs), so my battery runs low each time I use it. Great phone overall
Bought this product for my wife and it's already falling appart.
The good news about this case is the rubber isn't tearing like the previous model did.
Very good cover. Protects as advertised. Would recommend to anyone looking for a great cover.
I love my Defender series Otter Box. The only thing wrong is that I was putting the rubber piece on over the plastic and it ripped in one little spot. Its not a big deal, I still use it.
Good product, only downside is the flap by the charger plug doesn't stay closed when not in use.
The latest version is much sturdier than the previous. The outer material is less flexible than the prior one. Holds up much better! The case remains intact.
This case is very strong and will definitely protect your phone from most accidents. The only problem I have is while texting. Because the case is thick, it is hard to access some parts of the touch screen but I think the inconvenience is worth the protection you get.
I'm a dropper, so I bought the otterbox at the same time I bought the phone. It gives really good protection, but I really have to coax the little flaps back into place after I use my earbuds or plug the phone in. Also, when I listen to audio on my phone while I I walk, I put the phone in the belt clip attachment with the screen facing out so I can easily access the stopwatch. Most of the time I have the screen facing in. When I switch from screen facing in to screen facing out, I have to turn the actual clip on the belt clip holder. I don't know if its clear what I mean by that, but at any rate, it's a teeny annoyance.
I ordered the pink/plum. I ended up returning it. The color was hideous . I got the one with the flag. Its been great. No problems.
The color was right as shown, the case fits, but the hole is not properly aligned on the side of the case for the silent mode
If you are anywhere from a little rough to heavily rough on your phone, this is a MUST have case. The Best part is that it does NOT make your phone too bulky as other durable cases do.
You can barely hear the person on the other line when on a call. Speaker sound is horrible unless you open the charging port cover. Keyboard buttons on the bottom of the screen are difficult to hit. 2 days after buying this case the rubber started to come off the case. Screen protector doesn't attach to the phone screen very well.
it is very protective and i think anyone who goes near water alot or drops their phone frequently should get a case as good as this one.
While I do prefer this case over the Otterbox because it doesn't have that silicon edge, Lifeproof has its own challenges. The clear screen over the phone face feels cheep and has two scratches already. Air remains trapped between the phone and case which interferes with the ability to naturally and easily touch the screen. And I hate that I have to use the jack adapter to plug my ear buds. And something about using the adapter results in my iPhone not recognizing that I've removed the adapter, so I have to do a hard power down and restart the phone to hear sounds without the ear buds. Bottomline, I wish I had my money back.
Great functionality with a little difficulty connecting to the charger, especially third party products.
My husband uses this case on his phone around the farm. His phone needs a lot of protection and this does the trick. But, he does complain about how heavy and awkward it is.
Have had some hot days this summer that created condensation in my otter box defender when kept in a pocket on a job site so I bought this. The unit is lighter and smaller than the otterbox, but it sticks out farther on the belt clip. When in a pocket, Siri wakes up all the time, meaning the button is getting pressed more easily than with the otter box. The security feature on the belt clip makes me feel better about the unit not falling when in hazardous height areas, but I do miss a few calls due to the lock simply slowing me down. The headset dongle must be unscrewed / removed to make phone calls when a headset is not connected, i understand it is part of the waterproof feature, I just wish there was a more elegant solution that did not require a minute or two of unscrewing and putting in a port plug. This port keeps it waterproof in my sink testing, I just would like to see an improvement primarily because there is no where to store the mini stereo dongle when not in use, even with the belt clip or armband. The speaker phone is barely useable when compared with the otter box defender (which is not waterproof). I was also able to use other accessories with the otter box defender (Magellan GPS kit or charging cradles), they are simply not an option with this case. The integrated screen protector has great touch/feel but causes the phone to be unreadable in bright sun / glare conditions. Overall this is a high quality case with waterproof features, the drawbacks may be part of making it waterproof today, but I hope future generations of product from this vendor will continue to evolve as the technology allows.
I use to have an Otterbox Defender case on my iPhone but I decided to look for something more slim without sacrificing the durability that the Otterbox has. With the Lifeproof case, not only is it durable but it is also waterproof! I really like the looks of it and it is so much more slim than the Otterbox Defender case. The only drawback I can think of for this case is that you have to use a attachment for the headphone jack since most headphones will not fit through the opening in the case, but overall this is a great case!
I bought this to replace my OtterBox Defender, which is really bulky. This is thinner, but the opening to access the hole on the bottom is too small. You can only use the Apple cord--not Griffin or Belkin or anything else. That's a royal pain. Now I'm finding that the touch screen cover isn't letting me access easily. So my verdict is not worth the money.
My children have iphones with different covers that they are not happy with. I bought this one not just on looks but for the protection. So far I have been pleased with it. I do see a small amount of moisture between the cover and the screen. Hopefully, that will not be a problem in the future. It is hard to tell if it has a good seal or not.
I personally have the black one and my wife loves the blue. However the bottom lath on this one is too loose so we will return it or switch it out.
For those that have the dropsies or are less than careful around liquids this is the case for you.
My problem with the case is that you have to use the USB cable that came with the phone. Also to use the headphones/AUX cord, you have to use the adaptor. Its ok for occasional use, but if ou use the IPOD feature, it becomes a pain.
If you or someone in your family spills coffee or pops a lot this is the case for them!
My only issue with the case is, older ipod cord to fit into the charge port.
I love to go fishing, canoeing, swimming, and just playing in the water with my kids. I can have my music on or check sports on the internet or throw my phone and let my kids chase after it to see who can get it first. It floats and I don't have to worry about it sinking.
What's the point in having a waterproof case if your phone winds up in the bottom of the lake? This was a great idea, and I used mine all summer long. I used it in Destin, and it was a constant attention grabber! I love lifeproof and have all of my apple products in one to date! The life-jacket is definitely an excellent product!
Easy to snap in your phone and go . My only problems are that it slips a bit when you sweat and when you tighten it, it pinches your arm
The strap works great. Very comfortable. It's easy to use, the phone can be popped in and popped out easily. The strap needs to be made in different sizes though. Make sure you read the instructions and have a good idea how big your arm is. I tried to place it on my forearm but that didn't work very well. The strap is not stitched together so after trying to make it fit on my arm while running or working out for less than a month, it came undone. I did take it back and had it exchanged but I'll probably end up giving it to my wife when I get her a new lifeproof case this week.
Read all the negative comments and still bought it, and glad I did. It is the best armband for my phone. I can only use it on my right arm for some reason, cause if I use it on my left it pinches my skin a bit. Other than that I would recommend it to everyone who wants to listen to music and go running. You must have the Lifeproof case in order to use this, just in case you didn't know.
Great casefor running and other sports but if you have an arm larger that 15.5 inches then you cannot use the arm band. It is not good if you spend $80 on the case and then another $40 on teh arm band just to findout it doesn't fit. I also bought the belt clip and use it to run for now.
As a runner and bicyclist, is it great to use the same armband for both sports. I don't have remove the phone from its case to put into the armband. Nor did i have to buy a separate holder for the bike. The phone locking mechanism into the armband is peace of mind while riding. I only with the arm band strap was longer. I had to use an extra piece of Velcro so it would fit my arm.
Given the bulk of the Lifeproof case this is really my only option for an arm band, unfortunately. According to the lifeproof web site it fits arms up to 15+ inches. I may have big arms but they're not bigger than 15 inches. When I put it on I have to push my sleeve up and strap it around my bare arm which gets uncomfortable after a while plus there's the dork factor of having one sleeve pushed up higher than the other. Another issue I have with the case is inserting the headphones is a pain once the phone is in the case. What I do is put the phone connector thorugh the top of the case, plug it into the iPhone and then put the iPhone into the case. I'm going to see if I can figure out a way to make an extension which I don't think is going to be an easy task so odds are I'll end up selling it and the iPhone case on Craigslist and try some other solution. Before you buy try it on to make sure you don't have fit problems like I'm having.
Great cover for Iphone. Shows your Team Spirit! Fits snugly and does not obstruct usage.
This cover is made poorly and doesn't properly align with iPhone controls. You can't switch the phone to vibrate because of the imperfection. What a disappointment. You had to know the covers were faulty.
Figuring that Skullcandy would have better QA, I bought this over an ebay case. It feels and looks great, but it covers a button! I mean come on, wouldn't you make something that actually fit?
I've been using a Gopro for water shots, but the video is dark and grainy if you are not in full sunlight. The Optrix housing takes superior video in even overcast days. Now that the iphone5 is out, I hope I can buy a used 4s as a dedicated camera.
We were planning a lot of outdoor activities this summer and I wanted a way to use the video option on my iPhone. I could have bought a GoPro, but that's just another device to carry. I bought the Optrix as soon as it was available and have taken it down rivers, in and out of the ocean and strapped to the handlebars of our wave runner. The footage has been killer and I never felt like my phone was in jeopardy.
I love my new Otter Box for my I-Phone. It's a great overall case which protects the entire phone. It has a cool design on it. It is very durable, yet still feminine.
This is a great accessory. It is stylish and gives the IPhone 4S a bit of splash. I purchased this for my husband and he loved the design on the back. It has helped protect it from scratches and small bumps and drops. While he carries it to work, he doesn't pull it out to use often but when he does, he gets compliments.
This is a good product. It is great for people who are hard on their phones; however, it weighs the phone down.
Hi bought this for a not so tech savvy friend. He had just transitioned from the BlackBerry to the iPhone and was uncomfortable with the virtual keyboard. I got this for him to alleviate his separation anxiety. the product is well thought out, has an on and off switch so you don't waste the battery, and you can use the same charger as your iPhone. It was the deal of the day and for $32 and change well worth it.
Got it because I thought it was cool but I was mistaken. Can't see the keys in the dark. Seems like it was cheaply made. It did work.. Got it as the deal of the day and could not even think about someone paying full price. Wouldn't let a friend get it but maybe a stranger...
The case is really nice. It fits the phone pretty well except for the top portion. Mine seems to have a small gap between the phone and the case but other than that, the case is nice. It isn't so bulky and it is very slim in width so it doesn't make the phone any wider looking. About 1/2" thick. Great buy for the price!
made my life, as simple as it gets amazing how no one thought of it before !!!
My husband's Lifeproof case ended up leaking. A quick call to Lifeproof and the case was replaced! I wrote Lifeproof a letter and requested that they make teal color too for personal reasons and they are coming out with one soon!!! Kudos to Lifeproof and thank you very much!!!!
This is absolutely the best looking case ever! I get compliments on it every day, it's very light, but sturdy, and has a great feel.
Limited Edition. I love how it feels. Who doesn't love chewy
As an apple representative I have tried out many iPhone cases, ranging from the bumpers, to the lifeproof, and the one that I feel provides the best protection is the otterbox. Now I may get criticism on saying the lifeproof isnt as protective but from a 3 foot fall the lifeproof didn't hold up. Although the defender isn't waterproof, manly every color matches a white or black iPhone 4/4s. I highly recommend it and hope you choose the otterbox!
Gender and age specific, bought as a gift for my teen aged daughter.
I luv the versatility of the product. I really luv the design of Hello Kitty. It really does its job of preventing the iPhone screen from any scratches and dust.
I bought this just for a quick replacement case to get me by for a little. It has a really nice look to it with the blue Hurley logo on the back, but after a months use of in and out of pocket that blue is beginning to fade. Case cracks very easy, barely tapped it against a hard surface and it failed.
i wish the price for iphone was $85.00 dollars its much more better if it white color it does not matter i can buy harry potter skin cover the black
The shield lowers the resolution of the HD quality screen by more than half. It looks like a film of technicolor static/glitter covering your screen.
Impossible to apply. Does not cover the whole screen. Is not fully anti-glare in the same sense as most other anti-glare covers. Only comes with 1 cover. You get 1 strike and you are out.
as far as covers go its a good one. i've not had any bubbles, or discoloration on the cover itself as of yet and it does keep the screen easily readable. fairly heavy phone user so as long as it stands up i wont need to update this review
My wife says the clarity is affected slightly but offers protection when our kids are handling the iPhone. Worth it for us. Very happy with the outcome.
Excellent cover. No smudges, no glare. Love it. Would definitely buy again for next iphone.
I can't tell you how difficult this item is to apply to the 4s. First of all, it didn't even fit my phone, it was smaller than the phone. You have to spray your fingers and the protector with the included solution. After trying to line it up several times, a small piece of black lint stuck to and would not come off. For the price, you should get more than one protector. And here's an idea. Maybe have the peel off backing on both sides with a tab to peel it off after you apply it. Then you don't have to wet your fingers and try to high five the phone to apply it.
I loved my Zagg cover! It definately feels thicker and of higher quality than most screen protectors I've had in the past. Unfortunately mine prevented my proximity sensor from functioning. I had to choose to either cut a hole in my $25.00 screen protector, or remove it all together; definately a let down. Because of this, I'm unsure of recommending it to others.
This product is very expensive for only one screen protector, once you remove it you might as well throw it away. They claim they will replace them for life...I went to the site to get a replacement and they wanted 3.99 to shipping plus to put a hold on my credut card for the full retail value of the replacement (which they claimed was 25.00). If I did not send back my old zagg (at my own cost for mailing) within 7 days they would charge my credit card. Stay away!
This screen protector is great. Completely smudge proof, any indents and scratches smooth out after a few seconds & is very easy to put on your phone yourself I just wish there was one for the back of the phone as well.
The phone protector works well, I just wish I didn't notice it was there.
This is worth the $. Leaves no streaks and less glare in sun. Best Buy guy put it on after I bought my Iphone 4s. It has a lifetime warranty. Worth it!
I am happy with this item. I had purchased it when I had got a less sufficient case. In the time since (45 day), I upgraded my case to an OtterBox Defender but kept the scree protector for the additional safety. Very Satisfied.
I'm very pleased with product. It does as advertised. Doesn't work well the otterbox comuter case. Case causes shield to peel back around edges.
Smudge free -- not so much. It is also hard to see the phone in sunlight. However it does protect my screen superbly. The next question is would I recommend it... Maybe... But, I would warn people about how hard it is to see the phone in sunlight. I plan to try and find a protector that works and is easy to see through in sunlight. Hey... Best Buy... You need a maybe button. I don't want to commit to yes or no for recommending this to a friend... I might recommend this. You are only offering strong yes or strong no. I am neither. You need to get a maybe button!
I have always used a Zagg shield for my iPhones but the new smudge free finish is the BEST!
the screen protector does as promised....no glare in the sun.
My wife had one of these on her last Iphone and when she upgraded, she wanted one on her new phone. It was very easy to install and provides the best protection for any sheild on the market.
Keeps my IPhone protected and it is easy to clean and keep the phone looking good.
Doesnt peel and is a good product for the price. The employee at best buy installed it for me and he did a great job I have had my phone for a month now
This is a great cover! It's smudge resistant which is my number one reason for buying it, and I love the anti-glare feature! I was skeptical that it wouldn't be as effective as the salesman told it would be, but he was absolutely correct!!
I have been using screen protectors for as long as I have had a smartphone. I started using Zagg Products when I has my first Gen iPhone. Recently getting the iphone 4s I was using a screen protector I got from the supplier. Until recently when it was scratched and I had to take it off and throw it away. Anyway this screen protector does what is advertises. It is smudge free and it does protect the screen. Putting it on can be a hassle. However, I just let the Best Buy person out it on for me. That way if it gets messed up within 30 days I can take it back to them and they can fix it. As for the screen. I have noticed that there is some grainyness or issues with the clarity of the retina display on the iphone. I have seen many complaints about this. I can honestly say that I do see it. However it is not enough to make me want to take the screen protector off. Face it, any screen cover is going to take away from the screen. If you want to protect the device this should not be a problem. Zagg has a lifetime warranty on this product and they are easy to deal with to get it replaced.
Great screen protector, doesn't show smudges, won't scratch
Definitely worth the money for this iphone screen protector. I bought a cheaper one to begin with and it was terrible for smudges and lines. This was the 2nd screen protector I purchased and I am extremely happy with it. Does not show smudges and scratches at all. I had a few bubbles in it when I first put it on, that disappeared by the next day.
Best Buy said this was the very best shield for my new 4S. Wrong...it doesn't cover the face of the device. For the recommendation and the price it should do the basic job of covering the device.
Other reviewers are on the money--the cut-outs on these are a bit off & even missing a rectangular portion cut out toward the top. Why? It serves its function but the lack of attention to detail in the manufacturing of the product is lackluster. Meh...
It works. It works well. So did my $2 screen protector. Don't know if it's worth the extra money but I have only had it for 2 months.
Although the Smudge Free does resist smudges and not require frequent cleaning, it is all in the way it was installed and that was done in store, but not exact enough so now after two weeks there is a Bubble on the edge, that has to be swiped out every few days to avoid the entire thing from coming off, and I am NOT going back to store to pay $8 to have it fixed. Lesson Learned from other phone
I love that its anti-glare and has a matte finish. However, I do not like how it affects the display of the iPhone. When looking at lighter colored screens you can see the screen protector--it looks like hundreds of little multicolored dots, as one reviewer put it: it looks fuzzy. I'm going back and getting the shiny one; I'd much rather wipe off my fingerprints than have to look at a "fuzzy" screen.
Seems rock solid. No glare, touch screen still seems sensitive.
I was a little apprehensive about purchasing a screen protector that was $25 but I'm glad I did! This thing is awesome! I've dropped my phone a couple of times and I've not had to worry about the screen being scratched when I picked it up. It doesn't have an annoying glare either. Very easy to put on too!
I like that I don't have to wipe my phone off every two minutes with this screen protector and the glare on the screen is all but non-exsistent. I don't like that sometimes little pieces of debris (lint, dust, crumbs, etc.# get stuck wroung the edges and the home button. I've also had problems with the screen getting dirty #from daily usage) But so far its worth what I paid.
I have the Zagg Smudge free shield on my IPhone and I love it. I'm not having to wipe my screen constantly due to smudges and it doesn't effect the view.
The "anti glare" feature of this blurs the screen and makes it unacceptable to me, The Iphone has this great looking screen and it is ruined by this screen protector. Great protector but lousy view. You can get the clear and it will take care of this. Don't buy the anti glare.
I'll start by pointing out that you're purchasing a screen protector, expect your display to change slightly visually. I found the application process simple and the directions very clear as to the proper way to prep the phone and install the product. That being said, all the reviews with complaints about the installation being "difficult" are maybe coming from people who should have paid someone that knows what they're doing to install it. They give tou everything you need to install it properly other than patience, and common sense. As a chef I use my phone frequently while in the kitchen and have found the anti-smudge/glare protective screen to be irreplaceable. Now when I see other folks iPhones covered in finger smudges and scratches I immediately reccomend this product to them. A friend of mine actually cracked his screen recently and applied the Zagg shield to hold it together until he can replace it. This is one tough as hell product, and I love it.
Let the professionals install this item even if it costs you a few dollars. Like the warranty on the item so if it bubbles I can take it back.
This InvisiShield is great compared to the stock InvisiShield. I have the old shield on the iPod Touch and is always smudged and greasy. This smudge free has a nice feel that isn't slippery. I like the matte finish compared to shiny.
it is smudge proof that is a plus, but it takes away from the nice screen, makes it fuzzy
I bought 2 phones and 2 protective shields. One shield is currently peeling up. The other one was peeling back causing dirt to collect on my daughter's phone sop she peeled it off and threw it away. (She did not realize it was warrantied. )
The screen protector is well worth the money. I would hightly recommend it to anyone with a phone of any kind. It protects the screen from scratches.
I also had the employee do it. It was worth the $7.99! They GUARANTEE it. If it bubbles or pits or has a dust speck under the shield, they will do it again! I know because when I got it home, there was the TEENIEST speck of dust and the girl gladly re-did it. She even redid it a 3rd time because SHE wasn't happy with how it was lined up. I couldn't use my phone for an hour or two and they recommend not putting the case on for 24 hours. Honestly, I LIKE the non glare and smudge-proof qualities. What it takes away from the resolution isn't enough for me to give up on it being non glare. I travel a lot on planes and cars and I can't STAND the glare!!! Who cares about how amazing the resolution is if I can't see the screen to begin with. Depending on YOUR personal use, you really may not like the non glare. I think for gaming, it might not be the best but I don't do that so I don't know. I have no problem with the holes not being lined up, they are, BUT, I did wait to put the case on and I still saw a little lift on the edge where the case was perhaps pushing the edge up. It flattened right out though. I might need to just get a less bulky case which is ok with me. Good news..if that happens again...they will replace it again. FOR FREE. And the ZAGG people promise that they will replace the protector for LIFE. So really...the $26 plus $8 isn't a lot to spend in the end. How many junky screen protectors do you have to buy in your life? It adds up! If you don't like the non glare, Zagg makes the shiny one too. It's a really great product!
Pro: It has protected my iPhone from a badly designed case that otherwise would have damaged the screen. Con: It really does effect the visual quality of the screen quite a bit. I'm the only one of my iPhone clan to have one of these, and other users when they see mine make a comment along the lines of, "Oh. Eeeew. Didn't you get a Retina display? The colors are off, the resolution is low... Mine looks much better!" And, they're right: theirs do look much better.
Went on easily and looks good. Believe it will protect my screen.
This was a little pricey for me, but when the warranty was explained to me that the cover was virtually indestructible and that over time I would spend the same or more for multiple covers, I went ahead and bought this. It went on very easily and does what it claimed- no smudges or glare! I never have to wipe the phone like I had to with other covers. Great product!
What's wrong with this thing? It really affects the clarity of the display. I even took it off, cleaned & reapplied - no dice.
What a waste of money! Even with following the directions exactly, this shield did not offer a clear screen. it may protect the iPhone, but what good is it if you can't see the screen????
I spent the money and while installing found out that the protector is considerably smaller that the screen itself so it does not have the right fit. The cutouts are not lining up right. And now that it has been used, I cannot return it. I could have spent much less for a better screen but thought trusting product from BestBuy was a good idea. I was wrong
The screen cover is complete junk and is awful!!!!
I've used Zagg screen protectors in the past and they work great. I saw this one and bought 3 of them (myself, my wife and daughter). After applying it to my daughter's iPhone 4, i was very disappointed. The "filter" and/or smudge proof coating causes a strange effect on the screen resolution making it look almost pixelated or grainy. What ever benefit was gained by the retina display is lost after this. Although it is still great at protecting the screen from scratches, visually, it detracts from the high resolution of an iPhone. I am going to return the 2 unused products to Best Buy the next time I go back and purchase a standard Zagg shield.
This is the 2nd one I've used in the past year on my Iphone and it will be the last. Don't waste you time on a product that dosen't last. Better off buying the cheaper ones and replacing every few months then spending the extra money on this product that is more expensive and simply doesn't last. Both time the Besy Buy employees recommended this product, both times I bought it and both times I regretted it. Never again!
This screen protector took me several tries to get it on properly and then when I finally did get it on, it made the screen look all pixely.
although it's easy to apply, it doesn't always stay in place. i replaced it with the zagg anti-glare and had the best buy staff apply it. the zagg may be more, but in the long run, it was well worth the step up and having it applied correctly.
If you are use to the regular protect shield do not buy this one as it does take away from the retina display
It was screen protector difficult to apply and the edges bubbled up when I attempted to put a couple of different cases on
The Zagg is easier to apply than other screens I've used, is the toughest available, and has a lifetime warranty. Can't be beat.
The ZAGG sceen protector has worked as advertised. I highly recommend having a trained store employee install the protector--they use a special type of spray and there are NO bubbles once they've finished the installation. I have not noticed blurriness, nor have I noticed any smudges. Compared to my friends' phone screens with no protectors, the protector really makes a difference. It's one of those products one pays no attention to after a couple days. That's a good thing.
ZAGG makes good products and has a lifetime warranty. It does distort the picture though which was a big problem for me.
This product provides adequate screen protection, but is no where near smudge-free as the manufacturer describes.
Although this screen protector does keep smudges and scratches from ruining your phone it makes your screen look horrible. Do not purchase this unless you are willing to give up the retina display.
I had the regular one on my old iPhone, but got the Smudge Free one with my new 4S. I love it.
I got talked into (conned?) by the sales associate at a Best Buy into spending a ridiculous amount of money of a screen protector. Initially I was really unhappy; when I applied it to the phone I couldn't seem to get some bubbles out of it, and it does change the way the display actually looks. The instruction manual says that after a few days "imperfections" will work themselves out, and much to my surprise, they did! 48 hours later the thing looked perfect on my phone; the bubbles magically worked their way out, somehow. It also feels kind of cool to the touch, and it doesn't *EVER* smudge. I know that seems hard to believe, but I seriously don't ever have to wipe my phone off anymore. So here's my bottom line: if you care about glare, care about smudges (and having to clean them up), aren't bothered that the phone screen will be dimmed a little, and are willing to pay an outrageous amount of money for a protector, this thing is pretty good. If not, go with the $10 one.
I'm surprised this has such poor reviews! I think this screen protector is great. It does make the screen appear a little fuzzy at first, but I don't even notice it anymore and don't think it takes away from the HD quality. The little bit of texture doesn't bother me. If anything I think it makes the screen feel more resilient. The smudge resistance is awesome; phone doesn't get fingerprints all over the screen anymore. Definitely think this protector is worth the money.
I love this! The glare is reduced as promised, granted it takes some getting used to the somewhat grainy look. Other than that it does everything as promised, its easily installed, and is better than any other screen protector Ive ever used.
I bought a zagg cover for my 3GS a couple of years ago and it was amazing!!!! So I immediately had one put on my 4S when I bought it!!! I had to return my original 4S to apple due to defect. When I received my new one I opted out of ordering my free replacement screen protector because it was that bad!!! Zagg please go back to original style it was very protective and didn't make your screen all pixelated!! I can clean off a few finger prints!! Zagg WAS the best!!! Now I wouldn't spend one cent on their screen protector!!!!!
I've used these shields for my iTouch, iPad, and iPhone products for a long time. They have always been a favorite but the improvement of a non-smudge surface for the iPhone is fantastic! I can't wait for them to roll the shield material out for my iPad!! I would not own an iDevice without having this protecting the screen :)
I purchased this screen protector with my new Iphone. I paid $8 for Bestbuy to install it. As I was leaving I noticed the screen looked grainy, but I was in a hurry and didn't think much of it. I got it home and it looked really bad! What's the point of having a really nice screen if you are going to make it look bad with this protector. I tried to return it to bestbuy a few days later, but they told me that since it was installed I could not return it. The store manager told me to damage it and get the company to replace it with the regular clear one. So, I paid $26 for this plus $8 for them to install it. Now I am supposed to jump through hoops and pay $4 for shipping to get a screen protector that is $10 CHEAPER! For all the math majors out there! $26+$8+$4= $38 just to end up with an overpriced $15 clear screen protector. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!
First off, let me get one thing out of the way... screen protector quality depends highly on how well it goes on in the first place. This is probably my 30th screen protector installation, and it went flawlessly. Not a single bubble, not a single crease. It is rare that an installation goes so well as this one did. Because of that, I can say that it wasn't because of installation that I've had so many issues with this... 1. This screen protector was smudged/scratched with a clean paper napkin. I got a droplet of water on my screen one day so I used a semi-soft paper napkin to dry it off, resulting in a nasty scratch on this screen protector... strike one. 2. The screen protector has developed an odd orange-peel effect that is messing with the appearance of things on my screen. Not sure why this has happened... Strike two 3. From the start, this screen protector has collected smudges. Strike three on the "Smudge Proof" B.S. All in all, worst screen protector I've ever owned. This is made worse by the fact that I paid $25 for it... Unbelievable. The cheap no-name screen protector I bought from Verizon when I first got my IPhone was superior to this one. Which leads me to my next suggestion, buy a generic screen protector for $10 or less. It will most likely be better. Before I leave without giving any pros... the one thing this screen protector does well is reducing sun glare. For once, I could actually read my screen in direct sunlight! But that is quickly nullified by the numerous cons that plague this product.
This thing is great...once you've given it the three days of cure time it needs! I can't imagine how you have that kind of time to not use your phone, but it needs every minute of it. Once that is accomplished, it is quite tough and quite clear.
This screen protector is terrible. It does work good for glare and smudges but it takes away the clarity so much that I took it off. It's like having an HDTV and watching everything in standard definition. Do not buy, there are other cheaper protectors out there that are way better.
Have tried all type of screen protectors...even multiple Zagg products...on various devices. This is by far the best of the lot. Zagg glossy screen protectors are good but this anti-glare, anti-smudge protector stands alone. Will it diminish, somewhat, the clarity?...a little...but this is a result of the anti-glare technology and is more than a equitable trade-off. The anti-smudge aspect works well too. One of the reasons I recommend this protector is ...I have the Zagg protector on my phone and then have the iphone in a Otterbox defender protective case with its own screen protector. Slicker screen protectors can cause a " moisture " look between the 2 protectors...but not this one. I have used the slick and anti glare Zagg protectors on many devices and their protection is first rate. I recommend using both the Zagg and the Otterbox case for dual protection. The Zagg for adding strength and scratch protection to the glass face, in a case or not , then with the Otterbox case as a durable second screen/device protector. Neither affect the touch screen performance. With a little care and patience...they are fairly easy and straight forward to apply.
Despite all of the negative reviews on this product, I would have to disagree with many. It is unfortunate that most believe they wasted their money on this product, the only thing I felt like I wasted money on was paying them $8 to apply this screen on my phone. This product makes the screen a little fuzzy looking no doubt, but it does its job well, protecting it from any scratches. What got me was the lifetime warranty too. Over a few months the screen came a little loose next to the home button (iphone 4) and then some dirt got underneath it. I went online to their site and requested a replacement. I had to pay for shipping which was very cheap anyways and then next thing I know it, I received the replacement. I applied the screen myself this time (probably better than the best buy guy) and if anything is wrong, I look forward in getting another replacement. Overall, this is one of the best screen protectors on the market and you should consider it when buying.
Very disappointed in this product. Distorted the screen so bad, it hurt my eyes. Not smudge free at all. I'd rather have scratches on my screen than this on my phone. Don't waste your money. Best Buy will not refund. Trust me, I just saved you $25.00. Wish I could get my money back.
This product stinks. Grainy look cand see screen well and I is smudge proof because it always looks smudged. Hurts your eyes too
This is my first Zagg product and if the rest are the same will be my last. Do NOT BUY this shield unless you care less about screen resolution and clarity. I wasn't expecting 100% same resolution experience but this thing makes the retina display as you looking a Palm Treo.. Definitely will send it back. Was anyone able to return it to Bestbuy? thanks
I had the regular Zagg screen protector on my old iPhone 3GS and loved it. So naturally I purchased one for my new iPhone 4S. I didn't turn my phone back on for 4 hours after installing it and when I did I immediately saw how fuzzy or grainy the display looked. I put it side by side with my husband's iPhone 4 without a screen protector and mine just looks awful. Even my old 3GS looks better than this. If you don't care about the wonderfully sharp and clear retina display on your iPhone 4/4S, then go ahead and get this. Otherwise, do not buy it.
I followed the application instructions and it went on fairly easily. After a day of having the phone in my purse, the corners of the "shield" are peeling up and getting dirt under them. Also still has some bubbles under the front shield, but those are suppose to work themselves out. All in all, not what I expected and certainly not worth the money I paid for it. Will be contacting Best Buy to see about a refund. (Zagg offers a 45 day money back guarantee, so I hope Best Buy honors it.)
With the shield on, the clarity of the screen is greatly reduced. However, the biggest problem is that after a while, the shield develops black discoloring on the side stuck to the screen. This is the second shield I have had on my iPhone 4 and it developed the same discoloring as the first one after a few weeks. This was a waste of my $25.00 - don't buy!
Bought this because it was cheaper than other brands, and I regret it. The clarity of my screen definitely has suffered. Really wish I had done some research and bought a better brand
I'm reading the reviews for this product and I'm surprised of how horrible they are describing it. It's not causing my phone to have a glare and I'm able to see my phone if I'm out in the sun. As for the clarity maybe it dulls it very little but it's hardly noticeable. What's great though is Zagg has a warranty so if you really dislike it you just have to let them know.
I wanted a matte screen protector because the glossy ones always look dirty to me. Also, I wear powder and foundation and it tends to stick to the glossy ones more. I get that when clean, the glossy protectors look better, but this one just works better for me. I also love that I can see it better in the sunlight. ONE MAJOR PROBLEM: It covers the proximity sensor in the iPhone. It won't affect the black iPhone, but it will affect the white iPhone. Basically this sensor will turn the screen black when you hold it to your ear so that your face won't hang up on or mute your call. The protector made it so that the sensor didn't work and would hang up on anyone I was calling. It would also start calling people via Facetime. Best Buy was going to replace my phone because they thought that the proximity sensor was defective, but one of the associates pulled the protector off and the phone works perfectly without the protector. So, to use the white iPhone with this screen protector, you will have to cut the part of the protector that covers the proximity sensor off. Then it will work fine. I wish the people at the Best Buy who sold me the phone knew about this because it would have saved me a lot of frustration and a second trip to Best Buy.
This was the worst Zagg product. It made my screen resolution worse where I could barely even see the screen. Do NOT buy.
One of the most disappointing purchases I've ever made: $30 spent on this item and its installation. What other reviewers have said is true: One of the main reasons you buy an iPhone 4 is because of the beautiful Retina display. So you should take heed of the following... WARNING: THIS PRODUCT WILL ABSOLUTELY DESTROY THE BEAUTY AND CLARITY OF THE RETINA DISPLAY. It blurs and pixelates the screen with a kind of irritating iridescence. (That's the best way I know to describe it.) Smudge-proof? Maybe. No-glare? Not on your life. I ripped this thing off in disgust and threw it away after a few days. I kept waiting for the "rainbow"-ness of the screen to fade away, but it never did. AVOID AT ALL COSTS.
It does well against smuges and fingerprints. It protects the screen pretty good with scratches, but it is not anti glare. (it is not translusent) It makes the images on the the screen look fuzzy. It does not cover the entire screen as well and it tends to slide around covering up the camera. Have to keep moving it back into place.
$25 for 1 shield and it looks awful!!! I followed the instructions and the shield itself doesn't fit on the iphone. The camera hole is too small and you can see it when you take a photo. I tried to take it off and put on another one, when low and behold, there was no other case in the box. I can't believe I paid $25 for ONE shield. What a ripoff! I bought an iFrogs anti-glare for my ipod touch and it's amazing. It never came off, still on to this day (a year later) and it had more than one in the box for less than $25. I picked this protector because it was the only one left at the Union Sq Best Buy and I should have just bought the iFrogs online. This is an awful brand I'll never buy again.
Not that Zagg makes bad products, but I always hated the shiny, somewhat sticky of the their other products. This one is great!!! Protection, Great no smudge finger print free!!! I wish they made it for more phones.
Not recommended! peels off right away, doesn't fit its to small..looks terrible...just get the 20.00 original zagg fits perfect and looks awsome..
I have been using the Zagg shields on my phones since they became popular a few years ago and I have been very happy with other Zagg products. I was going to replace the shield on my iPhone and thought I would give the Smudge Free version a try. I had to replace it again the next day... Like previous Zagg shields, if you follow the installation instructions, the shield goes on very well. This version did not look or feel good at all. It says smudge free but it is not, it left as many fingerprints as other shields. It did take a little bit of the glare away in bright areas but the screen had a very strange feel and the visibility of the screen was very blurry which takes away from the awesome iPhone screen.
1. This version DEFINITELY reduces the screen quality. 2. The cutouts do not align properly with the home button and earphone speaker. There is no way to install without covering some of one or the other. 3. After only 22 days the cover started to peel. I don't mean peeling off the device, but actually separating on its own; like it's shedding its skin. But this peeling layer won't come off easily or in one piece, so it's really frustrating.
Before I bought this I had an Otter Box and while I really like it I didn't like the glare and also I had to remove the case a lot in-order to put it on my iHome alarm clock. This really does eliminate glare and you don't leave behind any smudges (i ended up popping out Otter Box's screen because if you don't you still have the glare and smudging issue). I have heard a lot of horror stories about installing these yourself but the young man in the department told me they can install them, which didn't take long and was done really well, plus if they mess it up its on them. Only downside is it doesn't cover the entire front of the iPhone 4. There is a small strip left exposed evenly around the edges.
I bought one of these for my Iphone 4 after having a regular Zagg invisible shield for my 3GS. The protector resists smuges and glare as advertised at the cost of losing you retina screen resolution. To put it short, it makes the screen look horrible. I returned it and bought/installed the regular invisible shield and I'm happy now.
Had product for 2 weeks starting to peel, sign up for replacement. Cost of $3.99 for shipping, eventhough package says free replacement, and no where not even in small print does it say plus shipping. Called customer service they gave me free shipping code, but now want my credit card in case they dont receive the broken screen protector back, in enough days they will charge my card full price. No thank you, You will not take my money then tell me if you received my return on time. Feels like set up to keep $$ would rather buy another product you dont have to jump through these hoops to get "FREE" replacement. BUYER BEWARE! And screen does look fuzzy compaired to original screen.
I bought a "Zagg" product for my iPad and loved it, so I thought I would stick with this brand. Unfortunately, the anti-glare makes for terrible screen resolution. It actually gives me a headache when I stare at it. I'm considering taking it back to Best Buy and ask what my options are since I threw away the packaging. I would try a different "Zagg" product, just not the anti-glare, anti finger print screen protector.
I had bestbuy install my Zagg screen saver on the new iphone i bought from them and i really like it, its clear screen so i see everything, it stays in place, won't smuge, it doesn't even seem like its there. great product.
I got this because I'm clumsy and figured my new iphone would get scratched. This product said it was scratch proof, glare proof, smudge proof. SO far is has been all of the above but, what is does not tell you is that you give up the clarity of the screen itself. I use my phone and then use my boyfriend's and his is so much clearer and nicer! Over all it's ok
I think the screen protector is a good buy for protecting your phone and I like this one alittle better than the shiney ones because of no shine and no sticky finger feel but I feel it leaves the screen looking fuzzy or not as clear as it should. They need to come out with one that is between the two not shiney but yet a clear screen
I had the full body protector on my iPhone which was fantastic, but I got a case and wanted to switch to the Zagg cover that was a little smaller so I could use them together. I pulled off my full body cover and put this one on but the screen resolution is awful. The cover brings out the pixels and ruins the high resolution. It's so bad that I am returning it tomorrow morning, less than 24 hours after purchasing it. If you don't care about the pixel issue, it doesn't show fingerprints which is a plus, but why have an iphone if the screen is going to look terrible?
My first iPhone, my first iPhone case. My iPhone is white so I thought the Belkin blue with white trim would be sharp. Which it was, for the first couple weeks. I have a touch of OCD and keep my hands as clean as I can, but no matter what I did the white trim still turned a funky grey and no amount of hot water & soap will clean it. I recommend this Belkin style, but I won't be choosing another with white. Will see if BB lets me exchange but since it's been 31 days since I bought it they might turn me away; we'll see.
So far so good. Love the color and fit. Good purchase.
I got this case when I got my iPhone 4. It was a combo with the invisible shield. It is great to start off with but not for "clumsly people". Does not protect if continually put the phone in danger. Great product great price!
I wanted a basic case that would provide basic protection agains scratches and provide more anti slip. This case looks good and provides both.
I love this case, it's not an otter box obviously but it does it's job of protecting the phone well.
This is a great product. I have already dropped my phone several times and it stays on and it protecting the phone.
I recently bought this case for my Iphone 4S and it's so perfect for my phone. I never had problems with it and it looks great. Looks durable, the price was so great, very affordable. I love the combination of blue and white color plus you can still see the apple logo at the back. I give this a two thumbs up!!!
Simple to use and works great, of course I have only had it for a few months so it may suddenly self destruct but i think thats a very low possibility.
I have been on a quest to find the perfect iphone case that does not add bulk. I love the natural feel of the iphone. I have tried just about every case and I love this one for several reasons. First is the design. I love the soft but rugged material used. Also the color scheme: blue on back and white bumper is awesome. The fact that you can see through the back is awesome. Looks sick. Second, the case is thin but thick enough to safe from a drop. Its about .2 or .3 mm thick. Next, it offers all around protection except the screen. Finally, the color scheme with the iphone white looks really good IMO. Love this case. great feel and perfect size.
I love the color, the fact that it's see through in the back so you can see the apple logo, and it's protective.I know that if it weren't for the case, I'd have major scratches on it :) Phew!
connection to iPhone cable does not fit perfectly and you need to double check in order to prevent it does not charge. Not a fair price for the benefit
This is even better than the last belkin case I had. The last one yellowed pretty bad this one it won't happen. So kudos to belkin on another great case!
Nice good great awesome case for carry on in you pocket
I do like the case. I was looking to switch from the rubberized Otter Box case that tends to stick to my pocket when I try to grab it. Unfortunately the Belkin case doesn't seem to offer much for shock absorption. I then realized quickly once I got into the car that my auxiliary plug doesn't fit into the opening the Belkin case has for the headphones/auxiliary cord. Problem #2 was when I tried to plug my AV/TV cord to watch Netflix on my TV through my iPhone, the plug in didn't fit because of the extra piece of plastic surrounding the plug in on the phone.
This cover is exactly what I was looking for. I have a white phone and it matches perfectly. My fav color is blue. I didn't want to cover up my new iPhone totally. I like the fact that the front of my phone is totally visible. You can even see the silver apple thru the translucent back. All of the buttons line up great! What I really liked was that this was part of a bundle with a ZAGG invisible shield, and they even installed the shield for me. Thanks BestBuy!
I bought this case with my phone to hold me over until the case I ordered came in. The fit is somewhat questionable. The sides tend to bow out away from the phone. If you shop around online, you can find a much more protective case than this for the same price. I would not trust this case to protect against much of anything.
The best phone case ever bought and it's my favorite color.
The cover installs nicely. The buttons line up and work well. The texture is just right; smooth enough to not get hung up when putting into or taking out of my pocket but enough grip to not slip in my hand.
I did not think that this product would last and actually work. I realized that it is a Great product and tough too!
Covers the phone nicely and protects the outer edge.
The case is great for protecting my phone. It is rugged, tough and water tight. But, it is hard to open/close the charging flap after charging the phone. Otherwise, it works great and really protects the phone.
Probably the best and toughest case on the market. Expensive, but worth it because you don't have to buy screen protection. It's already built in.
I've seen what happens to an unprotected iPhone when dropped. Not pretty, shattered glass on front and back. I wanted to be able to have confidence carrying my phone everywhere and anywhere. I really like the camouflage look, and have received may complements on this choice of cover. It does beef up the size of the overall phone but that is the price you pay for the protection.
I am an android user, but I decided to switch to the iphone for personal reasons. I have only heard good things about the iPhones so I wasn't nervous about the switch. I do not think the iPhone lives up to its hype though. First of all I am obviously comparing my iPhone experience to the android so if you are switching over like I did you may want to think again. The battery life is not that good. I understand with all the texting, calling, and data usage that any phone would have this problem- iPhones just have it worse. Most of the time when i touched a button it wouldn't respond and I would have to touch it at least 3 more times to get it to act. There are too many steps to do one simple thing. I am used to touching a text message to delete it or touching a widget to call someone. the iPhone takes 3 steps to make a phone call. You can not customize this phone at all. I am used to the android where you customize everything and I just wasn't aware how you have no freedom on the iPhone. Siri takes some getting used to- you have to make sure you say what you want a certain way for her to understand what you are asking her. Another problem I had that most people may not was that I couldn't sync selected items. I did not want the iPhone to sync my facebook comments but there was no way to get it to stop. Which this probably had something to do with the battery life not being good. On my android i was just able to customize it and have it do whatever i wanted. I do like the style of the iPhone and its phone calls were very clear. Facetime was awesome too!! I'm just not used to all the restrictions so I will be taking this phone back and getting a different android.
As with all Apple products this is a good phone, the only issue is not updating emails when they come in. the best that I have seen so far and very largmemoryry.
FaceTime and Siri are excellent aspects of this phone. Like the conferencing capability but complicated on 1st use.
The device itself is great, but the lack of 4G data is only justified by Siri. iPhones are just plain easy & fun to use and it makes people happy to use them for play & work. The next iteration of Apple's iPhone will have 4G data capability and might even coincide with Sprint's launch of their new 4G LTE network. If you have Sprint and have wanted an iPhone, the iPhone 4 S is worth it just for Siri.
This is a great case, for its designed use. This adds some protection for the day-to-day use, but it is no Otter-Box. This will not protect your iphone from a random spill nor a 20 ft drop. It is more of a demonstration of personality than security. It has a fun and organic look that always brings compliments.
Very disappointed with this case. The green in the picture is completely different. The color on the actual case is an olive green. I will be returnig this case.
The case feels much more solid than my former Incipio case that started cracking in a couple of months. It fits my Verizon iPhone 4 fine. Only complaints are very nit-picky. The plastic shell was a little warped in the package so there is a place where it sits just a millimeter out of place around the flexible part. The flexible part has a flap that covers the sync port and folds back, but it already doesn't sit perfectly tucked into the plastic shell. But if the problem was serious, I'd return it. I like the slightly textured outer feel and the inner part is about as substantive as you can expect considering it has to be relatively thin and flexible. All in all, it went on pretty easily and fits pretty snugly. It's solid but not too heavy and it doesn't look like it will crack too soon. The top button is hard enough to push that I won't keep pressing it in my pocket.
doesnt hold on to ur phone, comes off so easy, i lost it in my purse all the time! and if u drop it it'll broke in pieces! sooo disapointed!! :(
This product comes off phone easily and doesn't offer much protection.
I was very hesitant to pay 30 dollars for this case but i did it anyway. I am very dissapointed because after about a week the white part turned yellow. I cannot get the yellow to come off the case and am very mad that i paid 30 dollars for it. The case would work if it were a different color.
There is no reason my white phone case should of looked dirty within a month. I clean my phone & phone case frequently & it still looks dirty. I tried alcohol wipes, bleach, & industrial disinfectant wipes on this case and it continues to look gray. I had to replace it within 2 months because of it's appearance. Definately a waste of my money & Best Buy wouldn't let me exchange it. No more Griffin products for me.
Bought this and used it for two days and had to return it. Scratches showing everywhere, especially the back. Got a Speck hard candy instead.
Case fits great, protects all major parts of the phone, and even provides stability when placed on a flat surface on either the back or face of the phone. It even looks great on the white iphone when you first put the case on. Unfortunately the white turned all shades of colors starting immediately upon the first placement in a pocket (as indicated by previous reviewer), and has progressivly picked up every color of dirt imaginable. The case is now a dull brownish/gray color and looks terrible. It still protects, but hey, we live in a materialistic world nowadays. You can't protectt he most beautiful phone in the world with an ugly case, can you? We returned the case for a refund.
It protects the phone well and it doesn't slip off. It lets you see pretty much all of the phone while protecting it. However, the white color turned blue within one time of putting it in the pocket of my jeans and it progressively became worse. Black has all the positives but it doesn't turn colors, so I would recommend the product- just in black.
These cases are perfect for me. They are sleek enough so that you can still appreciate the design of the phone and offer protection from accidental drops on concrete or pavement. I've dropped my iPhone4 a few times since owning this case and it's given great protection for the sides and back. The best part about it for me is that it's still small enough to fit in my pocket ans doesn't make the phone big and bulky like other cases in the market.
I bought this case with a coupon so I got it for $5. It wasn't even worth a dollar. Within a week two corners cracked. I've had it under a month now and all four corners are cracked, one of which broke right off. The case doesnt cover the top or bottom of the phone, just the sides and back. The phone slides in the case, causing it to crack. It's cheap plastic and a piece of garbage. Do not buy it. Having the logo is cool, but I would suggest getting a better case. I have to buy a new one now because this one doesn't protect the phone at all.
I've never used an apple product before so I'm still learning, but I love it so far.
Hi, I've prob like many have owned many different Cell/Smart phones & 2 me the iPhone is the best by far In my opinion! I already own the iPad, and before buying an iPod, i did a rigorous study 4 myself on mp3 players & barr none it beats all, so getting the iPhone was a Logical choice!
I love this phone. Great functionality, apps run with little to no problems, durable, great music quality.
The iPhone 4S Siri is great - use it all of the time
The speed and reliability of the iPhone 4S, the quality of the camera, and the huge number of useful apps make this a great phone. The only downside is that the battery life is subpar -- especially when Siri is enabled. With any significant use, it is easy to run out of battery power in less than 24 hours.
it is as good as advertised. alot of apps i really enjoy using.
What's to say, it's an another great Apple device. I've been using it for about 3 weeks and haven't found anything bad to say except maybe I'm nervous about dropping or losing it.
I LOVE THIS PHONE. IT IS EVERYTHING I EXPECTED AND MORE.
This is my first smart phone, so I really don't have anything to compare it to. But... It does everything I could ever want. I love texting with it!!! It is so simple, I did not need any help figuring out how to use it. I like to take pictures and small videos, but the light does have to be perfect in order to do this. I have downloaded all of my favorite music on it. Most important, it charges so incredibly fast. I did not buy a battery backup for it, and right now I don't see a need. I like to listen to my music at the racetrack (drag racing) between rounds; I absolutely don't have any problem with the battery dying. But please note, I don't play it non-stop for hours -- just a little between rounds or longer if someone oils the track down.
It's like having an assistant strapped to your belt. The SIRI is amazing - at times I feel like it is traching me.
Everything works so smoothly on this phone. It helps me to stay organized with my appointments.
The product is good just i needed to wait about 30 min to get my phone, people in Best Buy was little bit lazy.
best phone ever. use friendly even if you are an "old dog" learning new tricks!
We have 3 iPhones in our family. The 4S is similar to the 4's that we have but the addition to the Siri. Son and wife love the Siri feature. The 4 and 4S were the same price so it was a no brainer.
This is my first iPhone and I really like it. The only thing I have a problem with is Siri. Sometimes she works and sometimes she doesn't.
I had an iPhone 3g before. The camera on the 4S is much better! Love the apps that I can get with this phone, too. I'm happy I got it.
Since I already had the iPhone 4, I knew buying the 4S for my wife would be excellent for her needs. She picked up on the usage of the touchscreen and app's really fast. The camera works much faster than the 4 and Siri is a nice gizmo that she enjoys. Now the biggest criticism of this phone is it's inability to connect to a Jawbone Bluetooth device. Seems like alot of folks have the same problem from what I've read on the Apple blogs. We still have not resolved the issue yet. Overall, an excellent product that get's better as she finds new uses. I'm hoping she will go to a Mac Notebook soon and the syncing will make the phone that much sweeter.
Great overall product! Satisfied with my purchase.
This phone has become so advanced it's hard to call it a phone, it is so much more then that!
I have been debating on the switch for months now, as much as i love Andriod theres just too many phones out there that cant really use the software smoothly, up unitl now! Since the phones are faster then my first pc when i was kid, seem to run Andriod alot smoother, and as intended. I however did switch to the Iphone 4s this time around, having most of my music on itunes its kinda nice speical when syncing / wireless as well now! However Itunes have seem to taken a few of Androids ideas, but come on they have to , to keep up. I miss my Android, speical with Razer thats out now, but at least with the Iphone you set with a smooth interface, and if you havent played with Siri, my Girlfriend is already Jelious. Yes i know there are some other speach to txt apps out there, but come on, this is soooo much better!, Sent a reminder when i get home to make shoping list to go to store, call parents, make apt with Drs office. All hands free, and adds to my reminders, as well as setting up my calendar. I think Apple can show the more techy ppl like me some more love, with out jail breaker there phone, some of us just dont want to . Pros, good phone,m easy to use, smooth os, Siri will be your secret lover. Cons miss my widgets, miss my live walscreens, dont care if they eat a little more battery. and more customisation, and could be slightly bigger
Aside from wanting a bigger screen, and all those fancy new bells & whistle's, the new iPhone is a strong addition to the already reliable iPhone product line. So putting my wants aside, and focusing on exactly what this device is, my review is still rating this phone as 5 stars. The battery life on the iPhone is very strong, and I feel outlasts many of it's competitor's. iOS 5 has multiple new additions, and so far has ran smoothly in my opinion for all my uses. The screen clarity is wonderful, and the updated camera hardware makes for GREAT pictures. Never had a problem with any of my photo's taken on this product. The faster processor has a noticeable zippiness to it, that makes for a smoother transition when running/opening app's. I do not utilize a case for my phone, and keep it in my pocket and it has proven to have a fairly strong casing against scratches. The keyboard on all iPhone's seem to have a much more "ease of use" and fairly more comfortable and accurate to use than other operating systems I've experienced. As for Siri, I haven't utilized it near it's full potential, but have found a few things it offers to be very useful. Overall I find it a worthy upgrade to the current iPhone's available, and with it's solid, stand-up performance I am overall very happy with my purchase. One further item to note, I initially had purchased the Droid Bionic and wound up ultimately let down/unpleased with the overall experience I took it back and went with the iPhone 4s!
Great purchase and the account executive in Peoria store is awesome, This phone is copy of iPhone 4 with 2 extra features 1. Siri which is voice command interpreter 2. Better camera Its also faster than 4 but you won't notice any difference in browsing speed or anything, So if you have 3GS it's a good upgrade but upgrading from iPhone 4 will be waste of money.
I have been a Blackberry user for years; I thought I would hate this phone, but love everything about it! I tried the Droid when it first came out and could not get the hang of the touch screen, so I was worried about making this costly purchase. So far I have not had any trouble with the screen and love the phone. The battery life is great, unless you keep a lot of apps running, then you will need to charge it mid way through the day. The one thing I do not like is that it does not come with a manual; there are so many things you can do with this phone that a booklet showing what the icons mean would be nice. I do not want to download and print one myself and for the price of the phone, it should be included. Overall I am very happy with my purchase and the longer I have it and learn new things from other Apple users, I will be able to do more with it. I will not be going back to the Blackberry!
Great Phone, glad Verizon finally has it!!!!!!!!!!
coming from having a blackberry --this is a great product but have to get used to the keyboard.
The iPhone 4S is a super phone and makes great pictures and video.
Call Quality: Through Verizon Wireless, I have noticed that calls are almost never dropped, Cell services everywhere I travel in the Southeast, Northeast, and Southwest. Obviously major cities (Orlando, Phoenix, Providence) have better coverage than rural, but I don't notice a difference in call quality whether it be 1 bar or 6. However, sometimes I can hear a buzzing noise from the phone's speaker. I had the phone replaced, and it still occurs. I assume this may be my sensitive hearing as I haven't found many people complaining of this issue. Picture Quality: Because of the retina display (326 pixels per inch) and the high native contrast, pictures and videos look great on this screen. I have seen a couple of Samsung screens with larger sizes and 16:9 aspect ratios, but I still am quite partial to my iPhone screen. Especially when it comes to watching darker films during the day. Watch Batman the Dark knight on a Samsung GSIII and the iPhone 4s and you will see the many more details the iPhone can come up with in shadowed areas. Battery Life: Normally I can go about 2 full days before I need to charge my iPhone. Now if I am playing games frequently, that number goes down to a day, but still an improvement to what I used to use. Value for Price: 5GB of iCloud storage, free iCloud backup, Siri integration, Turn by Turn navigation, Best App Store, Best music Store, iTunes Match, etc. These things make it hard to switch to a different phone manufacturer, and couple that with subsidized pricing; Yeah it's hard to beat. Sound Quality: The sound that comes out of the speaker on the phone itself is atrocious. I have heard a couple of phones that can do some great things with audio, and the iPhone isn't one of them. However, because of AirPlay I can push it to any system that supports it, or an Apple TV and listen to much, much better speakers. Get yourself some nice headphones and this becomes a non-issue.
So I will just highlight the main things that were wrong with this unit other than the fact that the one I ordered came with factory blemishes on the case. 1) The case leaves the front face of your phone completely exposed in the event you drop it. 2) This case adds a lot of weight despite claims of being the slimmest case in the market. 3) If you take the issue from number 2 and add it to scenario 1 you are increasing your odds of the screen being ruined because you have now added what felt like an additional pound to the phone. 4) Doesn't form fit like the Mophie case. There is a plastic piece that comes on top of the phone that really doesn't feel like it does anything to protect your phone. 5) The phone was not able to be charged while in this case. I kept getting the accessory not supported message. I was going to give this product 2 stars until I saw how much I typed and reduced it to one. I would suggest to best buy that they have a case testing station where you can see how it will feel on your phone before you get home and are completely disappointed. If you are looking for a case check out Mophie and my review about their case.
Third rail power case works good. Plenty of backup power and if necessary battery and phone can be charged by two chargers for faster turn over. Ship to store for pickup did not work at all. Not good.
The Third rail system keeps my phone charged and allowes me to my headset charged too. It is easy to use and to keep up.
I've tried a bunch of the extended battery cases and all of them were too bulky and only served one purpose at a time. With this case instead not only is the case so slim you barely notice it, but you can also use the battery to charge all your friends mobile devices. I simply use a short usb cable for any device iPhone or micro usb (pretty much every phone charging type) and I'm good to go. I would also like to mention that I'm not a fan of chaning the feel of my iPhone 4, but this case made me leave it on all the time due to barely noticing it is there and I can charge using micro usb connections all the time.
To start off I've spent way too much on cases for my iPhone thinking each one was "The One". WRONG!! Until I found this one...Perfect size, not bulky, extended power for your iPhone with needing a plug or charger. I really like this system and recommend buying an extra battery because two is one and one is none...
I am a former palm and droid user, this phone blows them away.... Will never go back....
Ordered an iPhone 4S through PayPal and BestBuy online. Picked up in store same day, no hassle! My problem was with the carrier, V, returned to BestBuy, with absolutely no hassle!!! People are split 50/50 whether it is the phone or the carrier that cant hang onto a call, but, I loved the phone. Likely to buy an unlocked for use with my present carrier!?!
Bought two iphone 4S 64 gb from Best Buy. Salesman was extremely knowledgeable. He canceled my previous phone with AT&T, enrolled me into Verizon, sold me two phones, assured me that two GB's was going to be enough data per month for my lifestyle, and transferred all my contacts and photos in less than 30 minutes. Man was I impressed! Phones are great. Can do everything!! Good selection of protective cases. Much fun. No Complaints!
I went from Android to the iPhone 4S. I like the phone quite a bit, however... 1) GPS functionality pales to Android. With Android I was able to use GPS almost anywhere. Not so with 4S - I seem to need cellular connectivity. Seems poor. 2) Apparently Google Maps is crippled for iPhone - no voice nav. I would have to pay dearly to have it. Looks like a yearly fee. Poor - it's free with android. Other than that, it's a fine device. Intergrates very well with my wifes iPad2. Facetime is great. I miss the GPS functionality and voice nav - those are the things that would make me consider going back to Android. I also like the easy way that I can create/access files on the Android. I hate having to go through iTunes to do everything, plus the fact that iTunes seems to want to re-sync everything if I even change 1 song/file. Other than those nits. It's great.
I've been putting off on buying a smartphone for too many years, always concerned that I'll purchase one and it'll be out of date within two months. That may still happen, but I see myself being very happy with the 4S for a long time. Siri is fabulous; iTunes and the selection of Apps make this phone well worth the investment. Email connectivity - seamless, unlike a friend's Droid X - has literally changed the way I do business at home. A great product, as you've heard thousands of times over.
Happy with my iPhone, great product. Easy to use. good text, pictures and music, great apps highly recomend
Excellent Phone coming from a Blackberry which was so slow.The Iphone is so much faster internet actually works don't have to wait forever to load a page and the apps are awesome. Overall just a fantastic product. Highly Recommend .
I was an android user from Droid 1 and have had 4 different android phones and a xoom. I was tired of the fragmentation within the android community and decided to give up my iTouch and android phone for the iPhone. I have had it for a couple months now and I am still smiling. The iPhone us a smooth OS and I am not missing my android as much as I thought I would. For a person that does not want to root/jailbreak a phone and wants email, music, games, calendars, messaging and the helpfulness of siri this phone will work for you.
I waited along time for the IPHONE to be available on verizon. Wish I had waited a little longer for IPHONE 5 With 4G service
I bought this to replace a Droid X. While I am an android lover, the fact that phone makers want to modify the Android OS to the point where it is worthless is what has made me come bcak to an iPhone. I had a 3GS in 2010 and this phone is leaps and bounds beyond that phone. While there are vast improvements from the 3GS, there is definately room for further improvement. The one thing I miss the most already is Swype. That is an amazing tool, especially if you regularly text or email from your phone. I know there are apps in the app store for the iPhone but those I have found don't come close to the android Swype. But I have found that the voice recognition on the iPhone blows the Android out of the water. I was regularly having to correct words when I would voice a text message or email on my Droid X, but so far I have found that pretty much every word I speak, whether to Siri or directly into a text message is spot on. They have definately caught up to Android in a way, but still have some room to make improvements. Compared to the Droid X, this phone blows it out of the water....it is quick, very responsive and on Verizon's network, it is nice to have a phone that works again instead of locking up cause it has to catch up.
The camera got an upgrade, the SSD was doubled from 32 to 64GB, the apps are still the most robust in the market. This phone in short is a mini computer as it does just about everything one could ask for all while fitting in your pocket. Also Facetime is a great feature as I use it all the time with my closest friends.
I have had the origianl Droid and the Bionic and this phone is head and shoulders better then the droids.
This is my first iPhone, so I guess I was expecting it to do everything... but it doesn't! I acrually liked my Blackberry Torch (with the keyboard and full interactive screen) mucvh better for functionality. That being said, the camera on this phone is great. The ability to send photos with only a couple of clicks is awsome. And the ability to edit photos is great, too. I still don't know all the ways to use the phone, as the iPhone instructions leave a lot to be desired! I purchasedf it from BestBuy and while they were really helpful with the purchase and adding my contacts, they lost interest after that and support was non-existent for learning functionality. It obviously does all the basic iPhone stuff and the apps are good. The biggest problems are the battery and Siri. The battery life is extremely poor! The first time I used the phone I was out and needed to take some photos. Starting with a full battery charge I was able to take 19 pictures and then the battery was completely gone! This is extremely poor, and shile Apple knows about this fault, they haven't done anything to improve it yet! Siri is a great idea and one of the reasons I bought the phone. My particular phone works if you turn on the microphone manually, but not if you just put it up to your ear - as advertised. Also, although she 'learns', you really can't do a whole email with sentences and punctuation. It's a one-line service only. So the advertising is quite false, but it's a good idea. Would I recommend this to a friend? I would suggest they give a Blackberry a good test first, as well as the iPhone, or else stay with the 4s until Apple works out the glitches with the battery life and Siri.
My issues with this phone's perfection are this. Siri doesn't understand me, the call quality is kind of echo-y, as if I'm talking into one of those fake kids microphones that really just echo their voice to amplify it, the battery life isn't the greatest and the keyboard letters are a bit small even for my fingers. It has a great amount of memory and otherwise everything with it is awesome, it just takes a little bit of transition time from using a non-smart phone.
Easy easy easy to use. with phones OS you have to have a PhD. to figure it out. this is ready to go. And now with the cloud its even easier to keep all your "stuff" with you all the time. It is quite simply the best smart phone in the world.period.
making it greater. Everyone complaining about how it has to change shape is complete nonsense. Apple already had a great design, best screen on the market, tons of cases, why change? Why change usability of a product that everyone already loves? Apple did what it does best and that is making a product as best as it possibly can. I was a perfect example of an Apple hater in fact my job for the last 13 years was to write code for Microsoft products and still is. After owning 2 iPads (both versions), the new MacBook Air (13"), and now the iPhone 4s (64gb), I am truly impressed by Apple and will never hate again. Fact is Jobs turned the company around and the iPhone 4s is a great phone to be remembered by his hand before he passed. The product works exactly how you expect in every way. The ONLY issue I see is price especially when you want capacity but at least you have options. With iOS5 and iCloud managing information across multiple apple platforms is effortless, backing up information is automatic, and sharing information like photos across devices is easy enough my mom can do it. It's funny how we forget that this device fits in our pocket but can tell us where we left it, send emails, give us driving directions, lookup any website, and even talk to us with a decent form of artificial intelligence. And yes SIRI (the AI for iPhone) does work so much better than the "other" platforms it nailed EVERY word dead on and never misunderstood what task I asked. Now if they can just figure out how to get 4g on the iphone without draining a battery incredibly fast (which is why they don't have an iphone 4g yet). 5 out of 5 for me love it in every way. Ex android user...
I love my iPhone 4S 64gb! It's been a great phone so far for me! Recommended by a friend and my family, I am happy I took their advice! I love having Siri and the iPhone 4S takes great pictures without having to bring along a digital camera on vacations. I can do a lot with my iPhone...it's my life and helps me to stay organized!!
My 15 year old loves this phone. It does everything a highschooler could dream of.... He read books on it, takes pictures, plays games, listens to music, calls home, and watches shows or movies on it.
I had a thicker cover with a belt clip but it was just to bulky. I've had this cover on my iphone for a month now and I still like it. It's slim and goes great with my white phone. Luckily I haven't dropped my phone yet, but I have a buddy who has this same cover and his has survived several drops. It's not bullet proof, but I'm very causious with my electronics. It also fits in the workout band to hold the iphone so you won't have to take off the cover every time you work out.
This case Is really cute and lightweight but doesn't protect worth a dam. I dropped my phone on the sidewalk and didn't even look at it because I thought there would be no scratches but when I looked at it later i noticed scratches not only to the edges of the case but the actual edges of my phone. I also have a screen protector but it made no difference. This case is not worth this ridiculous price if the edges are not protected, which is where most of the damage happens anyway!
It's amazing to me how such a thin, small piece of plastic costs $30. In fact, all iPhone cases have an average cost of $30+. Ridiculous. Since I really don't have a choice, I figured I would go for something that protects the case, and will not make the phone bulky. This case, indeed serve its purpose. I haven't dropped the phone, yet, so I can't say much for its sturdiness. Just like the other reviewer, I too got white on white, and it looks as if I don't even have a case on the phone.
Like anyone who would buy a case like this, I wanted a bit of protection with minimal added girth. The case is stylish, fits great, and feels great in my hand. In actuality it probably adds very little impact protection but it does give me just enough peace of mind. I'm disappointed that it was so expensive, but I didn't find anything else that I liked nearly as much. Also, the image on Best Buy's site shows an apple logo on the back of the case. Mine does not have that. And as another reviewer noted, it does scratch easily.
I don't like adding bulk to my phones and I want it To feel like the manufactures intended them to feel. The ultra lean is amazing. Adds very little bulk and super light. Almost feels like there is nothing on. It may not be the otterbox but I prefer the feel. I highly recommend this if you don't want to compromise the feel of your iPhone. Awesome.
I have tried 3-4 other cases and this one is by far the best one. The case is super thin and doesn't add much size to the phone's overall size. It fits perfect and you have complete access to all ports and buttons. The only gripes I have are; the white scratches easily and I have yet to drop my phone in this case, but I'd bet it doesn't offer as much protection as other cases since it is so thin.
I bought this case because I wanted a slim fitting case that does not feel bulky and gave me the feeling of not having a case on my iphone. This case does exactly that! Mose people cant even tell I have a case on (I have the white iphone & white case) and it feels like I dont have a case on either. For 29.99 I don't feel it's a great value but it looks and feels great! It also seems to protect from most falls.
Great feel and fit! Very nice phone coverage. Looks like metal but is a very nice plastic that won't scratch up like metal.
After reviewing several models of cases my decision to purchase this case finally came down to fit and feel. My new iPhone 4S fits perfect and the texture of the case ensures a secure grip of the phone in your hand. I've had no problem with the camera, flash, or any of the buttons. The case is slim and very low-profile. I'm not sure how anyone could say anything negative about the functionality of this produce. I highly recommend!
I was hoping this would be a good cover for my IPhone 4...not so. The coating on this cover is easily rubbed off, especially if you use a phone doc or holder in your car. In addition, the camera hole on the back does not allow the flash to work properly - you end up with a smokey photo. I gave it a chance, but returned it after a couple of weeks.
Glad I bought this - it makes my white phone stand out.
Cover fits very well. I got a pen mark on it though and it will not wipe off. Overall, I like the cover
This is one of the only products I liked from Belkin. This product is pretty nice. The price was a little too much compared to other cases that I've seen that are similar to this one. But I guess that's because of the brand. I do feel comfortable carrying my iphone everywhere with this case on. Overall the case is pretty good.
This phone is awesome to me, It is very easy to operate and use the features. My 7 year old niece uses her parents phone all of the time to play games and such. This phone has definitely been the best choice and I am glad I bought it.
Great quality phone for price paid. Very user friendly. Wish battery life was longer. Seems to charge quicker in household outlet opposed to car charger.
Bought this for my daughter 6 weeks ago. She broke it already. I should have made her use the otter box even if she didn't like the color. The insurance from Best Buy requires you to leave the phone for 3-5 days. My daughter freaked! We could rent a phone for $50 deposit that you get back when you return it.
Good phone, especially since I didn't need Siri, a higher quality camera nor the better processor. It would have been nice but for $50, I couldn't justify the additional $150.
I love this phone. I have my calendar, reminders, lists all on the phone. The camera is great.
I have an otter box on this iphone and one drop still caused the window to crack. Would be an awesome phone if the structure was better built or window glass was stronger.
My wife enjoys it so far and likes listening to music on it too. She has taken several pictures and they have turned out nice
for the money it is fine I would not pay alot for this phone but I dont use it for all the STUFF just to call txt ck mail and face book
This was my first smartphone. I have found it very simple to use.
I think it is a great phone for you kids. I personally wouldnt have one for myself or my wife.
Got this iphone for my son for $49 you cant beat that price!!! It has just enough memory for his music and social networking and to make a few calls and text...its all a college kid really needed.
I love this phone!! It is great I have so much fun with all the apps, easy texting, perfect size I am totally satisfied.
We love the iPhone. My 2 daughters and I all have one, and my husband is planning on getting one. It is great for the apps and music. Sometimes, though I would like a few more "options". I came from having a Droid, and everything had settings that you could change. The iPhone doesn't give you many options for that, and it took some getting used to. I would also like to be able to just call a contact from a text that has been sent to me. As it is set up now, I have to leave the messages and go to contacts, find their # then call, or type in the # if it is someone that I don't have in my contacts. And I miss Swype!!!! Battery life is decent. I charge pretty much every night, but that is to be expected with a smart phone that is in use all day. I am on Verizon (3G), so the internet speed isn't as fast as it would be on AT&T with 4G. Over all, this is a great phone!
For the price, it is a fantastic phone. It is easy to use and practical in so many ways.
I've never had a phone I loved until this phone. I didn't get the 4S as this is only for personal use. I'm not that into apps, but this phone is great. I use the calendar, the camera, and a few handy apps. Easy to use even for the not-so-tech-savvy individual.
I thought this would be to hard to learn but it was awesome. and I love it.
Having come from the Droid operating system, I'm having to relearn the phone. Droid is much more user friendly. I wanted Apple for the streaming between devices and so far I haven't been able to stream my pictures from my phone to my iPad. If I had it to do over, I probably would've stayed with the Droid. I'm not very tech savvy so I gave the review a 4 because I'm assuming my problems are user error.
very easy to use, tons of apps availible, love it. battery last long very fast internet
Meets all expectations except the extra expense of the Verizon data plan and limited mb.
I was very satisfied with my phone and it's features.
Overall a very nice phone. Like having a mini computer.
Great phone would recommend to my friends. Need navigational app with voice. Overall great phone.
LIke phone, easy to learn how to use but do not expect to use with your bluetooth devices. Checkout Apple community forums about bluetooth problems before you buy. Will not work all the time.
I would recommend this to a friend. It is easy to use, and I have no complaints except my own inability to easily use the keyboard. :)
All in one in a phone and easy to use. Very good device. but I worry about the battery, how long I can use this iPhone. Good phone but dead battery, then useless. how can I replaced battery? maximum life time is 2 years? why do not make replaceable battery iPhone?
I love my phone. it is faster, easier, great pictures, love the GPS
This is by FAR the best phone I have ever owned yet! I am in no way an apple fan--I absolutely hate apple products but this phone is incredible!! The touchscreen is absolutely perfect compared to every other android phone I have owned--its not super-sensitive at all, but more or less just right. All the options are easy to use, the battery life is PHENOMENAL--I only have to charge maybe every other day or every few days depending on what services I'm using on the phone (some drain the battery fast as opposed to just checking email or text messages.) The sound and video quality are both excellent, and with verizon I have excellent reception! I can't really even say a bad thing about this phone except I wish it had a slide out keyboard since I have big fingers it get tough to type on the screen keyboard but even so, its not too bad on this phone. I recommend highly to everyone!
Grat deal on the price. I got it for my wife, and she loves it. I love it that she loves it; she has no complaints. It an iPhone, that alone says it all, awesome device.
The pictures I took were too dark. When I use the keypad, the wrong letters show up too often so I have to backspace and correct all the time. I like the size as I can carry it in my pocket, but this makes the screen small and it is hard to read at times.
Great phone. Glad I switched to the iphone and for only $50. even better
I have had this phone 2 months now and I love it! This is my first smart phone. There are so many awesome apps that make life easier. I was concerned about having a virtual keyboard since I use to hate them when I didn't have one but used someone else's. Well I am so surprised at how easy it really is! But when using the internet and especially the navigation system, the battery doesn't last too long. I just make sure I have a charger with me at home, work and in the car. The inconvenience is worth it to own this phone.
This is my first smart phone, and I was a bit nervous. I have to say within a day I was in love, and within two days I new how to use all the features! The ease of use is remarkable, the pictures are of amazing quality, and there are so many free apps to choose from! I now see why so many people rave about the I-phones.
I was very hesitant to upgrade to a Smart Phone due to the possible complexity it may have. No problem setting up, the phone pretty much took charge without my help. I love the phone, it's very "smart". I can say the only draw back is the battery drains fast especially if full brightness is set. I will say though that the battery charges quickly. Picture quality is superb.
Great phone. But I have limited data. But without that this would be a great phone.
This is my second smart phone and it is 100% better then the old one I had!
I bought this phone for my daughter, a 9th grader who "needs a phone to communicate with friends." She loves it. I have no complaint. I bought it in September for $50. Now if you sign up for a 2 year plan, you can get the phone for free. A good deal either way. Like any other smart phone, the battery life is short.
Data speed is very good and you really can't beat the screen resolution. Love it.
If you are into music; forget getting free music. Everything is strictly controlled by Apple and I-Tunes. Even to make a ringtone you have to go through I-Tunes. It sucks. I really miss my Android.
My husband and I LOVE our iPhones! We had the iPhone 3GS but moved and were forced to change cell phone providers so we each had the Samsung Galaxy S. We hated them! We actually paid the disconnect price, deposit for new phones, and bought the new iPhones because of how troublesome our old phones were. We will NEVER use an Android phone again. We also love that we can use iCloud. We both have MacBook Pros so connecting our calendars, emails, and pictures is a huge plus!
I have never been an Apple person. Until recently. I was an Android or Windows guy. My bro-in-law told me that I needed an iPhone. After having some problems with my last phone (Nexus), and talking with several other iPhone user's, I purchased an iPhone 4. My bro-in-law told me that there would be things that I would like and some things that I would not. The only major issue at first was that I could not upload to Google Drive. But then I found iCloud. I am a very happy customer.
I really like the phone aside from the battery life. I lower the brightness of the screen to help preserve life and it helps although there's a problem when I'm outside in daylight. On a good note, the phone charges quickly. Very nice phone and I recommend an iPhone to anyone.
I've been without a iPhone for the past year trying other operating systems on other phones and finally I got a iPhone back. Android is alot more customizable but the overall ease of use and how the iPhone performs with little to no software glitches makes this the best phone out there.
I like my phone...it has been a good phone. I like it because its a computer and phone in 1.
Sim card had to be replaced after two days. Transaction took 4 hours with lots of info not transitioned.
From it's stylish design, to it's intuitive iOS software, this phone is an amazing device. Also the camera takes very high quality pics when in HDR more. I highly recommend this phone.
I upgraded from a 3GS to a 4S, it is like going from training wheels to sports car.
hey it's a iphone gave my 4 to my wife got the 4s love it
I can't say enough good things about this phone. It is the finest quality product I own. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a phone.
I just upgraded from an iphone 3GS. The 4S is very fast and SIRI is a great feature! I highly recommend the 4S. The battery life is much longer and the phone is much faster. The only negative is that I wish I had more memory. 16GB is the minimum I would recommend. I wanted more but the price was prohibitive.
A must have phone for anyone who takes a lot of pictures & videos from your phone. And the wireless syncing is great! The best part for me an AT&T customer is on the OS 5.1 update I now got 4G without buying a new phone!
The iPhone 4S is a excellent phone to begin with. with its brilliant web browser and innovative features and now you won't drop calls more often because of the two antennas in the phone. All i can say is apple has done it again!
great replacement phone for the iPhone 3Gs and Itouch
Very amazing with also an amazing camera but im changing and getting a blackberry instead
Apple is one of the world's greatest companies, and for good reason: they make amazing products. The iPhone 4S is no exception. There are so many great things about the iPhone 4S that I don't know where to start? I love how seamlessly the iPhone and iTunes work together to get me the content I want on my smartphone. I use it for music, pictures, videos, surfing the web, getting directions, phone calls, e-mails, calendaring, and so much more. There are some things that I would love to see improved. See my blog about it for specifics: http://jaybos.hubpages.com/hub/iphone5featuresiwant Overall, this is a purchase you will not regret.
I'm very happy with the 4S as my 3G was getting old and very slow. The 4S had a great camera and shoots very nice stills and video. Downloads and general Internet surfing are very fast and the retina display is again a major step up from a 3G. I am not sure I would be as happy if I was upgrading from a 4 to the 4S but from 3G it is like night and day. Call quality is good; iMessage is fabulous; SIRI is better than I thought it would be; Facetime is decent and the GPS/compass features are good too. I find battery life to be more than adequate and charge about once a day. That said, I don't make many calls - just use the Internet features.
I have the original iPhone and finally got to the point of needing to upgrade due to lack of support with some apps, etc. The speed was awful, etc etc. I usually keep my phones a long time. I decided to upgrade to the latest greatest because of that fact. I'm ecstatic to report that I couldn't be happier. The speed is excellent. I rarely if ever get any kind of delayed reaction from it when using it. Everything works great as needed and it's just simply and great device. The camera lens is much much better and I now only use one device, this phone, for everything. The only "con" would be, compared to other phones that are out, the screen size would be nice to be a bit bigger - but really, that's a minor thing. All-in-all, I couldn't be happier.
I love my iPhone 4S! The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I think Apple should incorporate Flash into their devices. That would make them PERFECT! Along with my iPhone, i have an iPad that I love but not having Flash is very disappointing and annoying. To view some things on the web, I have to use my laptop and that's just wrong. I had an Android phone in between my iPhone 3GS and my iPhone 4S and the only things I liked about the Android over my iPhone was Flash and speed (4G vs 3G).
There isn't too much to say about this phone. It's an iPhone...that should be self explanatory. It does everything I want and ATT service provider works great for me. I will stick with the iPhone...I'm just waiting for the next upgrade.
Great phone all the way around. Awesome processor and very user friendly. Best of all, great reception in rural areas, at least locally.
iPhone 4s is the best phone I have ever had its good at all. Siri is amazing. Good thing is it doesnt waste memory. Bad thing is it doesn't have a good battery life. Its price I find it is very good it values every cent and more.
I had the iPhone 3G before this and I can say that Apple has made some great improvements. The most important improvement is that I get a better signal and better clarity over my 3G. I don't have as many dropped calls and I can actually understand the person on the other end of the line. The text messaging feature is still the same and I've gotten used to it and like it alot. With those improvements, the rest is just icing on the cake. Faster processor and better screen make gaming apps much more fun and probably make up half of my usage. The other half is to use it as an iPod and listen to music.
I have nothing bad to say. I upgraded from a 3GS and love it! The camera and features are wonderful; the screen is so clear!
Excellent video and photo quality. Love Siri and iCloud
Excellent Camera Great integration of features and ability to make using them simple. Phone coverage has been better than my previous phone Email, Camera, Facebook, Phone, Itunes... What else do I need? It covers everything and works great. Siri is in beta but even that has been awesome and will only get better...
I used an iPhone 3 Gs for two years, so it was worth upgrading to the 4s as soon as it came out. If you already own a 4, don't upgrade unless you just can't live without Siri (which really does work as well as the ads make it appear). A key issue for me was getting a better signal, since AT&T's signal is nowhere near as strong as Verizon's in this area of north Florida. My 3Gs constantly dropped calls, even in the middle of the city. Best Buy's no-questions return policy (for 30 days) meant that I could give AT&T one more shot with a 4s, and then switch to Verizon if I so chose. Turns out that the 4s works great, so I did not have to switch careers after all.
My first iPhone, first smart phone, so I've really nothing to fairly compare/contrast. I'm retired and don't use the phone constantly, but I do use it several times daily. I've read of disappointment in regard to battery not holding charge, but I find I'm recharging only every other day. I find Siri sometimes convenient, sometimes frustrating. Siri doesn't always get things 100% right. That said, one does get a chance to proofread & edit before sending messages, so I'm glad Siri's there as an option. The fact that the phone is so complex, so multi-featured, and yet so intuitive is (over-used word:) amazing. Thank you, Steve Jobs!
The reason I'm giving 4 stars is do to Siri! I only have a 200m data plan so my Siri only works on wifi cause I refuse to pay AT&T and Verizon's high prices! So siri is worthless! Also the great pictures are nice unless you want to post them on facebook or something because again you run into data usage! So basically I should of just keep my iPhone 4 :( AT&T& Verizon wonders why apple is trying to branch off to carriers with unlimited data plans!
Great improvement over the iPhone 4, better performance and greatly enhanced camera. Siri doesn't seem to understand southern accents, but I can live with that.
First of all the styling makes handling your phone easier, access to volume buttons much improved to the 3rd generation iphone. The screen is sooo crisp, pictures are fast, take one right after the other. Video is sharp. FaceTime lets you view your call in real time. Icons are beautiful, I love everthing about my new iphone 4S
I love my iPhone. Every feature you could imagine!! However, the battery life is terrible! I previously had the iPhone 4, and the phone held a VERY long charge. I'm not using my iPhone 4S near as much as my previous phone and my battery life is almost completely depleted in less than 8 hours.
Its fast and fun. My only complaint is that the key board is to small for an old guy like me
I upgraded my iPhone 4 16GB to iPhone 4S 32GB. The camera is definitely better and the battery life is extended also. I had issues with my home button and my camera on my 4 but none of those issues on the 4S. It has frozen maybe once but no serious issues.
This is my first iPhone. I'm glad that I waited for the 4S. I get a lot of use of the Siri voice feature. Also, synching my devices with iCloud is wonderful. I love that I can take my photos from the phone and photosstream to my other devices & home computer.
Im constantly surprised by everything siri can do. Yesterday just for fun I tried to see if Siri would write training paper for me so I opened a note a wrote a whole page paper via voice dictation, emailed everyone in my department, and then sent a mass text to let everyone know - all using voice commands while in the car. Then I let Siri pick a restaurant for lunch for me. my only complaint is that for some reason Siri thinks its not cold outside when I ask her and it's like 60 degrees. She should know that's cold for south Florida. It's quite a bit faster than my iPhone 4 as well. I also run audio streaming to my pc with shairpoint and the video mirroring to apple tv is sick too. Worth every penny (especially since best buy gave me more money trading in my iPhone4 than the 4s cost anyway).
This is my first IPhone purchase I have made and so for I love it. The phone can pretty much do anything that I was hoping for and more. I have the AT&T version and I have excellent reception as well as speed. The only major issue I have is the battery life. Even after the 5.0.1 update, my battery life is not where it should be. However, I am thankful that I am not having major battery issues that other people are having. Apple is currently trying to fix this problem. Another little problem is the efficiency of Siri. It works fairly well when you are connected via Wi-Fi. Over the data network, it tends to have more hiccups than over Wi-Fi. At times, it will not matter which one you are using, Siri cannot figure out what you are saying or trying to do. Siri is considered a "beta" program so I am being patient and hoping Apple will be able to begin perfecting it in the near future. Other than that, the phone is amazing. I would have no problem making a recommendation for this phone.
The phone is reliable, fast, and can do almost anything!
The iPhone 4s is the fifth model released by Apple. They took a great phone and made it better. The camera is 8 megapixels and shoots 1080p video with true image stabilization. iOS 5 adds iCloud and and tether free syncing. Siri the assistant offers an entirely new way to interact with your phone.
This is a serious upgrade from my 3GS and a terrific buy. I had one minor issue (my fault) and Apple took care of it right away.
Like alot of people I took great care of my 3g waiting for the new phone to come out. Bought it the first day it came out. Love alot of the new features. 4 main problems. Outgoing calls- 80% of the outgoing calls don't go through on my end even though everyone else receives it. I hear an echo and know it won't go through. Email - once i am in 3g and out of wifi my emails state "no sender" "no subject" and a date of 12/31/69. So all incoming emails can't be read until i get back in wifi. Freezes now and then. Biggest problem is that for over a month now Best Buy and AT&T stores don't have anymore 4gs for Att to replace it. I have been on the wait list since the day after it came out. Left business card also. I call and go up to my best buy store every couple days and sorry no phones. Checked 6 other stores in michigan regularly and no phones. Called multiple att stores and sorry no phones. So....My 30 day guarantee is over and I'm stuck with a phone that doesn't work properly. Best buy said sorry!
The iPhone 4S, as stated in the title, has everything a person could need in a phone and then some. Full HD camera, high speed processor, etc. Runs great! No problems with it yet.
Awesome service for when I was in the store to buy it.
Siri is my favorite add on. iOS 5 rocks too. I have tried many voice controlled devices inthe past and never had reliable enough response to make it worthwhile...until Siri that is.
Made the jump from Motorola and LG with the iPhone3Gs. It was the best move. Now, I upgraded to the 4S and it was an incredible jump as well. Faster, better video, and friendlier with SIRI!! The only thing I would have liked is a more durable outer shell. So I recommend a shell cover, like the Otter-box.
I just switched back to this handset from a Sprint based Nexus S 4g and I couldn't be happier. The phone feels more well-built and the screen feels sharper than my previous phone. AT&T's network, at least in Louisville, is at a minimum twice as fast. Siri is ridiculously useful, especially with a handsfree setup.
The best phone out there. Absolutely amazing, its fast and furious. Android users you dont know what your missing. And the best thing about this Phone is the speed, the camera and SIRI, OMG. She is absolutely amazing.
I have experienced numerous occasions of the 4s freezing up... There is no way to reset at that point, just have to let the battery die out. The unit gets quite warm , as this is happening. I will be visiting my Best Buy store this weekend for a new 4s
I am emmencly satisfied with my iPhone 4S I have upgraded from a 3GS so of course there is a world of difference "apples" and oranges to say the least. The retina display is absolutely amazing. The new cameras blazingly fast its clarity truly does rival most point-and-shoot cameras. as a photographer I can really appreciate what they've put into the development of the new camera. it really is the best camera to have on you at all times you never miss a shot. I have also recognized the speed at which apps opening close. animation video and games all are very fluid due to the speed of the new A5 processor. I was wondering why you couldn't navigate multiple routes in Google maps and that problem has been addressed. there are just too many upgrades and to many things to review with the space allowed here. I'm sure there will be many critics but I believe that this iPhone 4S is an absolutely amazing device, and wonderful leap forward into the future of what we can look forward to from Apple as a company. thank you Steve Jobs for your part in this you will be missed greatly this is just a piece of your legacy. last but not least I would like to say just a little bit about Siri. though this is just a beta of what is to come from Siri, I have to say that it works absolutely great. I have spoken this entire review using the Siri addition to the keyboard which is a testament to how well the application works. Thank you Steve, thank you Apple, and thank you Best Buy!
iOS is very smooth, no lag between menus, very fast and good camera for a phone
I had a iphone4, this upgrade has pretty much gone as expected, Siri works sometimes and not others, she tends to do better with women's voices than lower men's voices. battery life is worse than the iphone 4 despite messing with all the settings possible. definitely quicker than the iphone 4, better response, picture quality, etc.
Makes everyday things in life more convenient. I wish it would write its own review though. Because this is a pain in the
I picked this over the 5, not only because of the plug being the same, but, because, I KNEW it would be what I wanted. And this phone has proven to be so. Great for people who want an upgrade from a 3GS.
My new iPhone 4S uses a lot of battery power, but it doesn't seem to guzzle the battery the way my old 3GS did. Sound quality is excellent. The camera is really good. I really enjoy having 32 gigs of storage. There are a bunch of features I haven't learned how to use yet (Siri), but I will eventually.
I had a 4 and decided to get the 4S- well worth it!!!! Traded in my other phone toward this purchase and so I didn't have to pay the full price.... Didn't know you could do that! Over all extremely happy with my phone- love Siri and the better camera!!!!!
this product is great. I turn on when battery is almost dead and it takes it up to 75%. purchase the extended life version for $100. I read other review where the person had difficulty taking out. simply shift from side to side and phone comes out easily. this is a great product to have!
bought this for my iphone4 2-23-12. looked great, phone slid in fine. when tried to remove, could not get out. went to my local best buy(at the legends speedway) was greeted nicely and was helped by phone expert. when could not remove, went to tell manager. manager then proceeded to tell him that it was my problem and that i had to figure it out. was upset but held my patience and spoke to manager. he said that it isnt our problem and that i had to remove myself. i then told him well u endorse this product and that i want my money back. he said that i had to get it removed by apple experts. i then said well if they remove it and whatever costs will u refund my money. he then laughed and said no. so i tried one last time and i finally removed it and a struggle. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS ITEM!!!
I ordered 2 Mophie units from Amazon earlier this year and they both stopped working. When I sent it back to Mophie, they informed me that they were counterfeit. I was able to get my money back from Amazon and quickly ordered the "real" thing from Mophie. I have used it for several weeks and the unit is great. I don't use the back up every day, but I always know that it is charged and ready to immediately charge my battery a couple of times when I am traveling, hunting, riding my Harley or other reasons to be not close to a wall or car charger. It is great insurance to know that you have the ability to charge your battery alway up quickly with a flip of the switch.
This iphone case beats otterbox flat ! I would highly reccomend this product to anyone who uses their iphone frequently.
I love to have my phone with me to listen to music while I'm riding my bike or walking!! Easy to use and stays in place on your arm.
The arm band loosens really quickly and falls down my arm while running. It also doesn't secure the phone as it jiggles a lot when running.
I purchased this item to hold my iPhone while training for a half marathon. I ran in a race this past weekend where the humidity was high and the temperature quite a bit warmer and I had a problem keeping the armband taught while running. It kept loosening up after readjusting it--not something you want to worry about during a race. I also had issues with the velcro popping open and now use it upside down. I do like the ear bud cord storage!
I'm writing this review only to tell those who are put off by the negative Velcro reviews, that the Velcro works fine. It's not the sort of Velcro that clasps immediately at touch. You have to press it, work it in, for it to grab well and it has a firm hold. It's not a chore. MY COMPLAINT... is there is no way to use your camera without slipping it out of the jacket. Which, if it's on your arm, isn't a big deal. But if you also tend to carry it around in the arm band it's not easily accessible. Typing is kind of a pain for me as well. Especially near the edges of the screen. BTW It was purchased at Best Buy a little less than 2 months ago. Summary: Works well/is acceptable for what it is intended for(excercise?); is a pain for using as a case otherwise. Belkin FastFit Arm Band for Apple® iPhone® 4
The phone is held in from the bottom by a Velcro strap, does not hold. Don't waste your money
I love this arm band! I use it when I mow the lawn, walk the dog, or work out away from home. I have a little problem adjusting the fit sometimes, but that's a personal problem and not a product defect! :) The one thing that would make this better would be if the manufacturer could provide an adjustable holder for the phone, so I could slip my phone into it and clip it on the arm band without having to remove the case (I have a Speck case, which I love)! Great product!
I loved my Belkin armband for my iPod touch so when I found they had one for the iPhone I was sold immediately. But whoever designed it wasn't thinking at all because the iPhone is secured in by a velcro flap that isn't very strong on the bottom. So when running the jarring releases the velcro and your $700 iPhone slides out. I found a way to work by turning it upside down so the Velcro flap is on the top but definite design flaw!!!
Overall pretty good product. Don't have a lot of other experience to compare it with other than a basic $5 "sleeve" I'd used for a while that held the iPhone. You do have to tighten it pretty tight so it doesn't slip while you sweat and jog, but I've had no problems really with slippage or feeling like it was "too" tight. So far the velcro on the bottom that some people have complained about hasn't really been an issue at all for me. Besides, the sleeve is so tight that even if the velcro failed, it's not like it would suddenly fall and drop - you'd have time to react. One thing I don't like is that if I pull it out of the slot that the clip slides into while it's on my arm, it's next to impossible to fish back in there while I'm wearing the strap. Too tight and not enough "play" to just easily slide in and out like it should. it doesn't feel all that snug in the slot either, though I've never at all had an issue with it. Had it a couple months now and used it pretty regularly for biking and jogging.
This is a decent design, for the most part, but Belkin needs to fix the bottom opening/closure method. The vel-cro closure is weak and opens easily, especially when the user is running. I dropped my iphone on the pavement using it and cracked the rear casing of the phone. Now I use a rubber band to ensure the bottom doesn't open while I'm using it. Otherwise, it's good for active users. I don't use the arm band, as it is too bulky and awkard while running; instead I clip the case to my waistband and it conceals the phone well. The clear plastic front allows the user to use the phone normally while it's in the case.
IPhone slides in and out very easily. The size adjustment on the arm band is really easy to use. Love the headphone storage.
I purchased for the looks. Does not protect the phone much because it is very thin. Does not have a non slip feature. I have not been able to take it off the phone!! But is good for the reason I purchased it.
Ok. first of all I love Android phones. Ive been using Androids for the last 4 years, I have 2 samsung galaxy tablets and 2 htc evo 4g lte. But I have to say, I decided to give iphone a try out when my contract had expired. I figured i'll try it for 2 weeks, and if i dont like it, I'll just switch over to andoid before my trial period ends. well, needless to say, ive had the iphone for a couple of months now and I cant put it down! it's the best smart phone out there. it really is. all the other phones that are coming out now are all aimed at the iphone 4s to try and dislodge it from being on the top of the phone chain.... ( get-it). now this is my first iphone. I was anti -apple before but now i have been converted. The whole system is just all about user friendliness. the apps, the way the phone responds to you is just amazing. Apple customer support is the best in the business. My new catch phrase now is " Once you go Iphone, You never go back". this thing is truly amazing. let me tell you, if i could marry SIRI, I would!! do yourself a favor, try out the iphone. learn all its features and learn how to use SIRI. I guarantee you you'll be converted from android to iPhone in no time.
I purchased this phone before going out of town and after arriving in new york for a months stay, the phone would continually turn off and I (and 3 other users of this same phone) could not get it to turn back on. There were no Best Buys in the area I was in and after finally going to a Radio Shack to see if they had any idea what the problem was they showed me how to hold down the two buttons that would turn it back on. It had gone from 100% charged to 0 in just a few minutes of charging completely. It would take forever to turn on. Because I was out of town for a length of time before I could return the phone, now I have to make do with a refurbished phone, never really having gotten to use my new phone much at all. I understand the person helping me was only doing what she could, but under the circumstances it does look like I could at least have a new phone. I know that my circumstances kept me from returning it within the 30 days; however, they were also beyond my control.
For my non-technical wife (self-admittedly), this has been a fantastic addition. Having lived through the struggles with a Palm and other not-so-friendly devices, this has truly boosted her confidence and efficiency in using technology. She is able to navigate and explore, and my 13-year-old daughter is always at the ready to help out. She is still getting comfortable with "Siri", but I think it is worth getting the "s" version in the long run. And, I highly recommend the Otterbox case -- I wouldn't trust my device to any other.
I went from a Samsung Galaxy S2 to an Apple iPhone 4S. I wouldn't be honest if I said there were features I didn't miss about my Galaxy, but many of those were replaced and even improved upon. There are so many benefits to having a universal platform from accessories to brand recognition. The Siri feature is wonderful, as well as, iTunes App Store. It's like having a computer in the palm of your hand. Amazing!
Switched over to an iPhone in June after hanging with a 'Droid for about a year and a half. The transition to start using the iPhone and particularly web apps was much smoother than when I first got the droid. 3G in Lubbock, Texas leaves a little to be desired. This smart phone is going to be a great solution for me.
overall the phone is great other than the battery life, ? when will flash be available
I love my iPhone 4S. I upgraded from a BlackBerry and am totally hooked to the iPhone. I thought the transition from BlackBerry to iPhone would be hard, but it wasn't. The touch keyboard was a little hard getting use to, but once you get the hang of it, you can type fast like with a regular qwerty keyboard. I love the many apps I can get. Downloading is fast. I just wish that group text replies where private like on my old BlackBerry. On the iPhone, the whole group can see your replies, so if you want privacy, you can't do group text. But that's no big deal. If you want privacy, just text individually even if it is the same text message. I just copy & paste to everyone individually so that the replies can come just to me & no one else.Batter life is great. I use it all day and only charge it overnight. I love my iPhone. I have no regrets.
I waited for a few years to finally make a move away from the Blackberry to an iPhone. I loved the BB physical keyboard, but the apps for the BB were nowhere near as good as the same apps for the iPhone. The 4s solved my keypad phobia problem with the ability to use voice dictation. I will use the virtual keypad now and then and it is not as positive as the physical keyboard, but I'm getting used to it. This phone is also considerably faster in every operational aspect that I've tried so far, way faster.
I love apple!!! If I could've rated this more I would've rated this 1 million!! I would deffinitly encourage others to buy this iPhone
Great phone. Small computer. Mini iPad. All around great. The five will be even better if that's possible.
I have always had an android device and finally changed over to apple. I love the fit and finish feel of the iphone and the ability of all my apple device to share and communicate....calender and music!
My wife seems to like this phone. She does miss widgets tho.
I had nothing but androids and decided to make the switch to Apple. I was told by many that I wouldn't like the switch. But I haven't had any complaints yet! Many say that the apps that are for free on android cost with apple. But the apps that I use both are free on both apple and android. I would reccommend to all.
Initially I couldn't make a simple call from home. Sprint sent me an air rave or wave (forgot what it's called). That helped, but had to do a lot of trouble shooting and resetting. Even had to get another iPhone. Spenttoo much time with technical support. If I didn't have a Mac and an iPad I would've gone back to my android phone. I never had connectivity issues with my android, but battery life was terrible. Much better battery life with 4s.
Coming from a rooted HTC Evo 4G (going between CM7 and Sense-based ROMs), I was concerned that I would be put off by the screen size and Apple's Walled Garden, along with the lack of 4G data and customization options. But I was sick of how Android was slow and inconsistent, and wanted a phone that just worked, and kept working. On top of that I wanted a phone with a consistent software update cycle. From the first time I used my iPhone 4S I found the keyboard to be better designed and I use it with way higher accuracy. I have huge hands and thought a smaller screen would be less typing for me, but it's just the opposite. Apps in general are more consistent and higher quality, and the OS itself flies. You tap an icon the app opens. It's a marvel concept that Android didn't have for me. Lack of 4G hasn't mattered to me too much. I like in a decent service area and am usually connected to wifi. Lack of customization options also hasn't been a big issue. I realized after a week or so that all of the time I spent changing things on my Evo I was trying to make it more usable, convenient, and give it a cleaner look. My iPhone was most of that right out of the box. The battery lasts longer than my Evo's did, even with me constantly using it. I just can't put it down! Overall, great device, and 16 GB doesn't sound like much, but I've never gone over 60% storage, with 60+ apps installed and a 4GB iTunes library.
Had to pay for this and could have got a phone that is easier to use and better service for free. The service sucks with sprint. Apple is overpriced and I can't believe that are made in china for the price u pay!!! I had a better NYC phone 3 years ago. Apple sucks!
This phone has been amazing so far! I love how simple it is to use! I love the camera. Battery life isn't to bad but I do also use my phone a lot for apps and texting so in the long run it is pretty good.
I got this phone for my wife. She loves it and all the capabilities it has. It was very easy for her to learn quickly! She uses it more than she ever used her previous phone and really enjoys being able to check her email, facebook and go to the internet easily wherever she is. The camera is great and she now uses it more than our regular camera. With it linked to iCloud she doesn't have to fiddle with downloading the pictures to her laptop, it's done automatically.
figured I would love it since the first iPhone came out... but I was loyal to Sprint and I didn't want to leave their service. so I waited patiently and was well rewarded. internet speeds are more than fast enough, great connection and call clarity like Sprint always has been, and the device itself is as solid as can be. no complaints.
I personally prefer and use Android phones, but this phone was for my son and I didn't want to have to support an Android phone when he changed something without understanding what he had done. With the iPhone, I don't have that problem and that's why I wanted him to have the iPhone. Siri is fun to play with and works well for the most part.
Its a very good phone as most techno-centric people already know.
If I would've known this phone was so great I would've been #TeamIPhone along time ago!
Great phone however just one month after having it, I had to get another phone from the apple store. Phone was damaged :(
I really like this phone. It has some awesome apps that you can use on it.
Absolutely love this phone! Will never switch. Camera great. Apps are better. Everything is better!!
This phone is great I can use it for everything. My last phone was an android and doesn't even compare with how awesome this phone is. Love all the features and can't complain.
Easy to use, everything's great. the short baattery like is the only down fall but there are ways to moderate that
like it alot, super cute and thats all that matters
It was time to upgrade my phone to stay in synch with my wife. She upgraded to an iPhone 4S so I decided to do the same. I am impressed with the speed of the phone and apps and duration of the battery.
This is my first iPhone and it lives up to the expectations. It's very easy to use and navigate. Easy to download apps and syncs with my macbook for itunes and updates. Bluetooth with my car is great and syncs through the usb for itunes. I have had a couple glitches with the phone function not disconnecting from a call. Also I haven't been able to use Syri successfully either.
Overall the 4S is a great device especially for a beginner to the data world. I use it as an assistant, game station, and phone. Phone is very fast on WiFi and a bit slow on Sprint 3G but that's not related to the phone.. My only complaint is when I stream Pandora the phone gets hot after awhile. I expect the battery to die fast but not get hot. Other than that... Great work Apple!
I am an HTC man myself but my wife loves this phone. She has had many, many phones over the years but there was always something that she didn't like about them. This phone she loves. Period. So if you have a picky phone user in your family this is the phone for them. Best part is she can call our daughter on her iPod (as long as my daughter has an internet connection), the iPod works just like the iPhone. Awesome, especially if you feel 14 yrs old is too young for a phone.
My only complaint about the iPhone is that when you are used to the Google turn by turn navigation being so smooth and easy to use on the Android phones, you expect that iPhone to be equal or better... yet, I guess it's Google's way of sticking it to Apple... If the app store would have a decent Navigation app that actually links to Siri, it would be quite lovely...
so far this is the only phone i haven't managed to break as yet. i love, love, love this phone!!
internet is slow on phone dont know if its due to area that I live in
Phone overall is good and takes a bit to get use to. Only major thing I had issues with was sending pictures I get "failure to deliver" and have to resend up to 5 times. I do enjoy being able to explore more apps.
Best phone ever. Seamlessly puts pictures, movies, and music to my iPad. No lag or freezing up like other phones. Simply put it just works.
Just wondering what else they can put in the next phone! Because this phone is Great!!!
I am not into waisting time on phones and this phone made it very fast and easy..
Easy to use n navigate while multi-tasking, great camera w/ the ability to take screen shots, but not as fast as it could be. It ain't slow, but it ain't fast as it could be. Need to get away from 3G n convert to 4G.
The phone is great. You just Can't go wrong with apple. We waited for so long for tmobile to get it but they never did so we moved to sprint. So far so good... I would recommend this phone to all android users. Ppl say that iPhone isn't as customizable as droids. Actually there are thousands of apps that can help you customize your phone. The limit is your imagination and creativity! Think of it as a blank page cuz it comes with only basics and it's up to you to make it what you want it to be. Oh yeah and battery life... Just understand its a SMART phone and it's running hundreds of operations back stage that you don't see and even in stand by. Just carry the stylish charger wherever you go and you will be fine or charge every day.
Love this phone, its just like having a tablet. Fast internet, great apps!
Find it easy to navigate, not really liking SIRI she never understands me but the camera is sweet, and talk texting is fun works great. I really like this phone I have apple products at home so all my electronics are compatible.
I have just recently switched to iPhone and I must say it's so much better than Android. I will never switch back.
The iPhone is the most wonderful phone I have ever owned. I can do just about everything with it that I can do with a computer!
I have been a Palm user for 8 plus years and this is my first phone outside that brand and my only regret is why I waited so long! The ease of use and functionality of the phone is hands down one of the best! I would recommend the iPhone to anybody looking for great quality and huge interfacing capabilities.
After having an Android phone for 2.5 years, I finally went for the 4S when it came to Sprint. Not because I'm an Apple fan, but it does have some excellent qualities. I previously had a Samsung Moment, which had problems from day 1. Benefits of Apple: updates at will, not when Sprint wants you to. Apps work with all versions of iOS. Apps for just about anything The 4S is much better on battery life than my Moment was (more a Samsung issue than Android). I do wish that there was an led to alert you if you missed a call/text. I have mine on my desk most of the day (I'm a teacher, so answering it is not possible) , but would like to be able to see if i missed something. Of course, there are zillions of cases, etc, available. Don't like that everything has to go through iTunes. I miss the zedge app for wallpapers and ringtones. Ringtones are a multistep process with Apple. My gmail and Google calendars sync nicely. All in all, I'm happy, but I would have stayed with Android if I felt that they would support their phones with updates!
The best phone I ever had! I love the "Siri" function the most.
Even though I'm an Apple person, I switched from iPhone 3G to HTC EVO. Now I'm back to 4S. I probably will stay with Apple. Even though Android is an open platform with the ability to return apps, the iPhone is simple. Yeah, the apps are great, but I need a phone that just works.
Wonderful product. We selected the iPhone because we have an iPad and we thought it would be easy to use since we already know our way around the iPad. It is easy to use. Love all the available apps. We've had Sprint service even in out-of-the-way places.
Personally, I think the device itself is five stars, however the 3G sprint network it uses seriously cripples this device. Using the speed test app, I consistently get 0.01 Mbps. This is with great coverage. Anything you download, an app, music, etc, you're better off using wifi. Siri consistently times out on the first try. If you're on sprint and not on wifi, this device is only good for phone calls.
Great phone along with the service I got from the Best But Staff the time of my pick up. Only down fall about it all is when I got my phone Beat Buy had a perk if you got any new phone and service you got a $50.00 Best Buy gift card and everyone played stupid like it wasn't advertised one bit. I leave Apple products and I have never went wrong about getting this iPhone best choice I made
I love it! it'a a great phone to have the data is really fast when downloading on the sprint network!!!
I love my iPhone 4s, but if I had one issue it would be that Siri can be a bit stubborn at times. She worked great at first because I was just sitting on my couch using the wifi, but when I go out and about she doesn't work more often than she does. No major worries though...great phone.
Once I get to know more of what iPhone does, I know I will have the best device for my needs. Being in school right now, I have found many apps to help me. I switched to Mac 2 years ago and finally brought them together with the iPhone. It's great how well they work together. Best thing about it...NO MORE GOOGLE!!!!
There's iPhones, then there's a bunch of phones that want to be iPhones.
Love everything about this phone. Hope apple doesnt come out with the 5 soon or else i will have to upgrade. But this phone and esp Siri ofcourse are amazing and must have for anyone who can afford it.
Apple is a growing company that exceeds in making their products more and more user friendly. This is by far the best iPhone to date and is better than android devices. Having iTunes sync everything I need to my device is really awesome, unlike android phones you have to manually drag and drop files and what not (too much work if you ask me). Getting around on my phone is easy and work 90% flawlessly. Heres the scale (1 - 10) 1 being terrible , 10 being amazing -Phone Call Quality = 10 -Battery = 10 -Apps =7 -Durability=7 -Siri=5 -Camera Video / Picture quality=10 -iPhone on Sprint=7 Now i'll go through the reason's for my ratings. #1 Phone Call Quality Making phone calls to me for my job is really important , and its even more important that I can hear the client well and they can hear me well. Calling people is so clear , even if someone is sick and is barely able to talk , you're still able to pick up what they're saying. #2 Battery The battery is by far the best in the business and I have yet to find another phone (with my kinda usage of music playing and web surfing) that can handle all that and still have power by the end of the day. Most droid phones need an extended battery to do this...which cost more money. Charging the phone from dead to 100% takes around an 1hr 30min. Which is extremely helpful to me and others who use their phones for laptops. #3 Apps Now some may tell you android has tons of free apps, that is a true fact. Here is also another fact YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR! iTunes apps may cost you .99 cents but seriously if your that stingy for some apps you should probably go with a pre-paid phone. iTunes has a very strict policy about their apps so dont worry about some random person making these apps. #4 Durability Ive actually dropped my phone a few times and it has surprisingly been ok. (knocks on wood) I did not have a case on it ether. Dont be fooled into thinking you need a case for your phone. I've had many phones that ive dropped and have been perfectly ok. Some cases can actually ruin your phone when you drop them too. Again this goes back to the theory "You get what you pay for". #5 Siri Siri is a completely cool and new way to experience your phone and text messaging. Having her read your text messages without having to unlock your phone and all that while driving or working is amazing. She also will work with your apple headset. Now heres why she gets a bad rating. Unless you got full bars or you're wifi Siri will not work. She needs constant internet access for everything. She can also type up your messages completely wrong. I told her a few days ago to play a song, she ends up setting me up a calender date for the 12th of next month for 7pm. It really is hit or miss. Thank God she is only in beta...hopefully not forever though. #6 Camera Is amazing!! Best sound quality mixed in with amazing picture quality. Your iPhone will become your new camera. I've actually taken this to concerts and have been able to record decent quality in both sound and video. #7Sprint Ive been with almost every cell phone company you have imagined along with even ones you haven't heard of. I've also had more then over 50 phones 23 of those are droids. I can tell you by experience that sprint is so far the best company for your iPhone. Verizon is way to expensive, yes I get service almost everywhere (except my house -_- ) Sprint is very affordable and offers alot more customer service than I've seen from *cough cough* AT&T. Honestly this is a good phone and even without sprint it still is an amazing phone and is 100% the best thing you could ever had. Hope this helps you or who ever is looking to get a good quality phone.
This is a great phone, I have had it just over a month and have not had any major issues with it thus far.
My phone was not and still not is working at its full capability. I spent hours on the phone with Sprint and Apple trying to get my phone to connect with wi-fi. First, I had no bars in my home so Sprint sent me an airave device. The device worked until my internet service was delayed and then ceased to function. So my internet needs to be working in order for myphone to work in my own home. The device I wasstill using my data instead of my wi-fi. So it was a good thing I went with Sprint's unlimited data. However there are a number of operations that cannot function without wi-fi. One trip to the Apple store they reconfigured everything (which I had done a number of times with both Sprint and Apple on the phone). I was told to come back to get a new phone if that didn't help me connect to wi-fi. The following day with a failed wi-fi connection I went back to Apple where they questioned my router settings (I had already spent time to update my router which was recommended by an Apple rep via phone). After hours of being in contact with Apple reps, that was the first I heard of preferred wi-fi "channels" for my router. They exchanged my phone nonetheless and said that I may have to get in contact with my router customer service rep. I called Netgear to hear that apparently there is something wrong with the settings on my computer. It will cost $200 at least to fix what bug seems to block my Apple 4$ from connecting to wi-fi. And did I mention that my laptop connects fine to my router's wi-fi? It has been an exhausting road. I have changed my signature to add the following, "Sent from my iphone....if all technology is working harmoniously".
Great Product! Siri is a Great Addition and will only grow and get better! Sleek Design and Full of Everything you want or need! The ONLY Device you need to carry!
Bought as a Christmas gift for my fiancee because Korean is her first language and this is one of the few phones you don't have to jail break to get full Korean language support. Comfortable size, lots of features and downloadable applications, excellent build quality. Feels expensive. Is only offered in 3G but our local 4G coverage isn't that great anyway (No, the 4 in the name does not mean 4G). Hands free that comes with phone is top notch. Fiancee likes it and actually uses many of the smart phone technologies on it unlike her previous smart phones. That said, she prefers my Samsung Galaxy S2 for screen size and call quality, but I'm not giving it to her. :) Monthly insurance on this phone is over twice what I paid for any other phone, and if you don't get insurance it costs more to replace than nearly any phone on the market. That said, when you are done with it, there is an actual aftermarket that you can sell it on, unlike most of my old phones that are in a landfill or that I got five dollars in credit for.
Love this phone, it's fast, unlike my Evo, it actually responds to my touch, I don't have to double tap the screen to get it to do what I want it to do. It takes great pics and video. The apps actually work very smooth. I have to say that there's no lag at all, in fact I'm writing this review from it lol. Buttom line, if u have an Android switch, u won't regret it, it won't freeze on u and u won't have to reset to factory. Great phone!
This the best phone I have ever had. I love it. My only complaint is that siri could be smarter. Maybe it will get better with time and updates. Other than that this phone is everything I expected it to be and then some.
I bought this phone as a gift for my daughter and she loves it!
The 4s has had its ups and its downs in the media. Any of the downs however haven't surfaced with my phone. There are some unique things with Siri, but, not anything to really complain about. I am glad that Sprint finally got into the iPhone business.
This phone is awesome and easily took the place of my blackberry. I would definitely recommend this to anyone. The Sprint service on it is great also.
So far, I like he phone. My only complaint is the battery life is horrible.
Not a huge Apple fan, but this phone seems to be pretty good.
Who wouldn't love this phone? This phone is user friendly & works pretty fast not like an android. My 4 year old has mastered the use of this phone - crazy! I will never own another phone again unless apple makes something even better - how could that be???? Anyway the cost was hard to get passed but once I got the phone it was so worth the money - makes life easier. I was going to get a laptop in the next year I think this phone has convinced me I would rather have an ipad!Highly recommend Defender series otter box for protection!
I was excited when i first got my iphone 4s. But when i started using it, the internet speed was super slow. And i've heard the same from so many other people about sprint. The customer support is not so good either. They tend to be rude so i'm pretty much done with this company. Just a heads up for those looking to sign up with them. I do not reccomend sprint at all.
Siri is awesome! I am a sales rep and do a lot of driving. I am able to do emails and texts faster and safer with Siri. I just tell her to send it for me. Finding locations is faster and better than ever, as I just ask Siri. She is just amazing!!!! Can't wait to see what other stuff that Apple can come up with.
The iPhone 4S is a great phone, simple to use, good looking (fragile) and iOS is silky smooth. The main setbacks are the small screen (should be 4"), 3G data limitation and the radio isn't optimized for use on Sprints network (fist iPhone available for the carrier).
Quality is great and durability is good. Sound clarity is awesome. battery life is moderate. Quality is great and durability is good. Sound clarity is awesome. battery life is moderate Quality is great and durability is good. Sound clarity is awesome. battery life is moderate
I love using Siri, when my network coverage is great. I wish my batterly life was better, considering all I do is use the internet, text, & make a few calls. I was a big fan of the BlackBerry, and miss a few things, like BlackBerry Messenger.
I like the new iPhone 4S but find that I prefer a larger screen and that it is not as intuitive with some functions as is my old Android cell phone. The nice thing about the iPhone 4S is Seri with voice commands and the fact that I can sync information on my phone with my Apple computers with relative ease.
I love this phone! This is the best smartphone I've ever had. I had bought an 3GS for my daughter and myself last week and found out it was very slow and sometimes it even dropped lots of calls! Though my daughter is fine with the phone but I am not. I ended up returning the phone and getting an iPhone 4S instead. It works perfectly and fast and in my condition, it never dropped a single call. For people updating from 4, hold on and wait for 5! But if you're on a 3 (or lower) or 3GS, update to 4S because it is completely worth it.
I was one of the lucky ones to first get the Iphone 4s from Sprint however I must say that I was not impressed with this phone. After several days of poor battery life and not so great call quality, I returned the phone. After looking at several phones I ended up with my first Android phone, the Galaxy S2 Epic Touch. I have to be honest and say that my I phone felt outdated after using the Epic Touch for a few days. My battery issue is gone, the phone is really smooth, love the huge screen, camera and the call quality is top notch. I guess I got caught up in the I Phone hype. Do yourself and big favor and try the Samsung Galaxy Epic Touch if you are on Sprint, if you are like me, you will be amazed at what this phone can do.
The iPhone 4s uses the tried and true formula of the iPhone 4 which is both a good and a bad thing. Those with a 3Gs or lower I would tell to upgrade but iPhone 4 owners should save their money. It preforms slightly better than the 4 but it is hardly noticeable. The only significant difference comes with Siri which in my opinion is more or less a novelty feature and not worth the money. The 4s is by no means a bad phone, its just not quite what it should've been.
This is my first IPhone. My wife has the IPhone 4. I fell in love with her phone. Verizon service is the best although expensive. I had the Droid X but it CONSTANTLY crashed especially when using Google Navigation App. The only app the IPhone really needs to add is a similar but better App that the Android has (Google Navigation). Don't pay for VZ Navigator. It is not worth it. Map Quest has a decent free app on the IPhone. The phone is FAST and the personal assistant is "Geeky" but VERY cool. Buy this and get rid of your IPod Touch. No need for it any more.. Get the Smuge Proof Zagg Screen Saver! Let Best Buy Install It LIFETIME Waranty!
I am on my 3rd iphone with the same problems. I cannot answer the phone! The agent at the Apple store told me this is an issue that I will always have and it is common across every model they have including the 4s. Several times each week when my phone rings I am unable to slide the indicator on the screen to answer the phone, nor can I push the slider to unlock the phone. The official Apple answer is to just call the person back! Not possible if the person is calling from a location with a switchboard such as a hospital or your child's school. How would you like to miss one of those important calls? I am disappointed that a premium priced phone is less reliable than one of those $20.00 throw away phones.
This is the best phone I have ever had. I've been patiently waiting for Sprint to get the iPhone and I'm so happy they finally did. I have the unlimited data plan and I can say it is very worth it. I just upgraded from a blackberry tour 9650, what an upgrade. The touch screen is amazing, it is super fast, the browser is super fast, netflix and youtube stream perfectly. The battery life is decent. If you only use it for calling, texting, and e-mail it lasts a very long time, but if you are constantly surfing the web or playing apps you will notice the battery drain. I;m getting such good reception with this phone, much better than with my blackberry. To save the best for last SIRI. Siri is great I can now respond to text messages while driving safely. She understands everything I say clearly. Great phone!!! I don't think I'll ever own another phone other than an iPhone!
Had the very first iPhone, was due for an upgrade. Glad I waited for this latest model. Couldn't be happier with the new features and the way you can now customize some of these things. Worth the wait.
SIRI, SIRI, SIRI WHAT A AMAZING FEATURE. APPLE HIT A HOME RUN WITH THIS. BASICALLY GOOGLE SEARCH BUT WAY BETTER AND IT ACTUALLY UNDERSTANDS WHAT YOUR SAYING. IT ALSO HAS A SENSE OF HUMOR, WHEN YOU GET ONE TELL IT, I LOVE YOU, AND I NEED TO HIDE A BODY AND LISTEN TO THE GREAT RESPONSES. GOT MINE ALREADY AND GETTING MY OTHER EVO AND EPIC SWAPPED TO IPHONES ALSO. I SEE WHY THE HYPE IS SO BIG. QUAILTY ALL THE WAY AND THE BATTERY DOESNT DIE IN 12 MINUTES LIKE THE EVOS. YEA I HAVE THE EXTENDED BATTERY AND IT WORKS BUT NOW MY EVO IS 792 LBS. TOUCH PAD WORKS GREAT. MY ONLY WISH IS A LIL BIGGER SCREEN.
I went from Iphone 4 w/ IOS 5 to the Iphone 4s just today. I must say im not impressed. Siri is a cool idea but not very dependable. I kept getting the server is unavailable. Im not sure why?? I think it maybe that everyone picked up SIRI like a bad habit. The good is the HD video and high quality pic, very cool!! I notice a little bit of increased navigating websites. I believe this is the new A5 chip. My biggest complaint and most likely reason ill take back the iphone 4s is the battery life. In two hours, I went from 100% battery to 75%, ouch! This was w/ moderate usage: I read 4-5 webpages, checked my facebook/yearbook three times, read 5 emails, ran itunes for 30 mins, and accessed SIRI 6 times. That's 25% loss in two hours. It is much more noticeable then my Iphone 4 was. I read some online articles and they say standby time is 100 hours less than Iphone 4. They believe it may be because of A5 processor or SIRI feature. It's not the IOS 5 because my IPHONE 4 was good! Good Luck!!!
I love my new iPhone 4S. It has everything I need! I have my email, music, internet and of course phone services and a great data plan through Sprint. Only problem is that Sprint has shotty service in my area and I get dropped calls and other phone quality issues. Otherwise when I'm anywhere other than home, I have the best phone ever! I will never go Android again!
Love the iPhone - still working on learning all the features and figuring out iTunes - every time I try to use songs I lose my ring tones????? Since I have over 250G of songs on the computer it tries to put ALL of them on the phone and I can't figure how to just put about 100 songs on it. When I "sync" it I end up losing all my ringtones???? But, I will figure it out. Love the way it works so much better than my Blackberry.
This is a great product easy to use. It looks elegant. It has a good price, good camera quality, etc.
Overall, it is excellent in almost all aspects; my son couldn't be happier at the way the phone integrates with our Mac computer, his IPAD and his Iphone.
All in all this is a great device. It is so much more than a phone. Actually I use it as a phone less than for other things. There's an app for everything, the music and video quality are outstanding and the pictures are remarkable. I'd be lost without my iPhone.
BUY THIS PHONE!!! I had the best experience at Best Buy. The employees were so helpful in helping me pick the right phone. I have never had an iPhone, but now I am totally sold and will never have another phone if its not an iPhone.
I love my phone it's by far the best phone I have bought
This is an awesome phone. I had a LG optimus for the past two years. There is no comparison. I can even get a signal out in the northwestern part of Illinois with Sprint. I am extremely happy with my iphone.
Awesome phone just make sure you get a portable battery charger. Definetely worth buying it. I had it for two months now.
Great Case! Love the textured paisleys! ~ Wish it was in Blue! :o)
I love this iPhone 4. I know it's not the latest, newest model but I upgraded from a 3Gs and it is lots better! Couldn't beat the price, free!
I would buy this type of Phone Again. It has everything I need in a Phone
Let me start this review with the positive; it is a very attractive case, the artwork is vibrant and the material seems just think enough. The issue is it doesn't protect too well. The case has many very deep scratches and deep cracks. Mostly I've handled the phone with care. I dropped the phone only 2 feet high on concrete, case side down. I was upset to find that the glass shattered. And while I take full blame, I guess I wish the case added more value than just looking good. Cases are meant to protect, this protects the back, but...
Bought this for my new iPhone 4s. I had an original invisible shield for my 3G and didn't particularly like it, it darkened the screen and made it feel very tacky, so I was skeptical in getting this one. One of the mobile employees recommended this full body screen protector, I didn't mind the price as I had a gift card, so I figured why not try it out. I had it installed by the employees, which I would highly recommend, they are excellent at applying them as 2 days later, there are no bubbles on the screen. As for the actual screen protector, if it wasn't for the fact that I can see its outline around the speaker and cameras, I wouldn't be able to tell there was one even on it. It is silky smooth and doesn't diminish the color of the screen whatsoever. Ad with Zagg's lifetime warranty, I think it'll be well worth the money.
This screen protector for the iPhone is great. It makes your device even better, and you can have peace at mind knowing your iPhone is in good care. It was a little scary putting it on but it went great.
Great sleek cover I like to have my phone in my pocket so couldn't have a huge bulky cover. Had the employee at Best Buy Mobile install it onto my new iPhone, she did a great job, and it only cost $12 to have her do it and took about 10 minutes. Thanks for a great cover and great customer service. The cover can't tell it is on the phone and works well with no glare. Would definitely recommend the HD version of this cover vs the standard cover, just based on the fact of the reduced glare. I believe they are the same price or very close in price. Overall very pleased and happy with the product.
First of all, I might not be a typical reviewer. I have been using Zagg invisible shield products for over three years now. I am very adept to installing this stuff. Zaggs are not cheap and if you mess up an installation, that's a lot of money down the drain and I am sure proceeding reviews will talk about this. My review will not touch on installation, just the quality of the product. As I mentioned, I have been a Zagg user for three years. This is the best one I have seen. When I bought it, I assumed the "HD" stamp was just another marketing scheme. I simply needed a new protector for a new phone. After installing it, I could not believe my eyes. It's really a lot clearer and touching it is like touching glass. I showed it to a few friends and they could not believe that there was a screen protector on my phone. Yes! I actually went around to show of a screen protector. That's how good this thing is.
This was a gift and my friend is super satisfied and loves the case.
in response to the first review about the color fading, just a couple of things i can think of. Either your wearing Cheap pants and the color was running, or you just need to clean your pockets. I've had the white one and its been perfect! no issues with fading whatso ever. its a perfect fit, apple designed so it has to be very good. perfect protection, and unlike all the bulky "iphone cases", this one prevents your phone from scratches cuz it elevates ur iphone and protects it from impact. not only that, it doesn't hide the look and distinct features of the iphone.my favorite part is how you can actually see the whole phone, that expensive iphone look and everything.
After just one day of normal "pocketure" in my jeans and suit pants, the bumper became discolored. Get the black if you have a black iPhone, but maybe a clear/translucent if you have the white iPhone like I do.
The cover is super snug & cute. Would recommend this cover to anyone.
This case looks and feels awesome, and I get many compliments on it. However - like several cases of this design, the fabric is just glued to the plastic frame, and is coming apart from the case. I've had 2 other similar cases and they all do the same thing - poor design. Also, surprisingly the stitching which holds the red rubber swtch on the back and edges is wearing, so the red rubber is starting to come off. I'd expect more from a $30 case, especially given it's only 3 months old.
Great case. Fits better than a glove. Looks like the device could have had it come from Apple it was made to fit so well. Very durable with the work I do. Primarily used for when I'm on the job. Feels so good in hand as well. Slides in & out of pocket with ease. Feels better than an OtterBox. Love how the design has the speakers facing towards you. I will be buying another for my other iPhone for my partner. Customer for life!
Only problem I have one problem. I have a vertical belt holder and sometimes when I pull the phone out of the holster, the Mophie juice Box top comes off. They could try to make it stay connected a little better on the next modification.
This case doesn't allow any of the previous-gen apple chargers to connect to the charging port, or any headphones other than the stock apple headphones to be used w/ the case on. Beware.
I got this for my new Iphone 4S. I thought it was Verizon that was having bad reception but then I removed this case and my Iphone had great reception. For 3G signal here is the results for the Iphone 4S with the case on: Test Date: Feb 8, 2012 9:51 PM Connection Type: Cellular Server: Madison, WI Download: 0.39 Mbps Upload: 0.37 Mbps Ping: 75 ms Here is the results with the case off in the exact spot: Test Date: Feb 8, 2012 9:49 PM Connection Type: Cellular Server: Madison, WI Download: 0.65 Mbps Upload: 0.41 Mbps Ping: 69 ms Anyone have any suggestions on a phone case that does not take away signal coverage? Maybe a case that actually boosts signal? I wish!!!
As note on some prior reviews, the case was already discoloring (think it may have been returned prior to my purchase) and I returned it as well.
I absolutely love this case! I had the generic speck brand one before and I hated it because it broke in several places. I drop my phone at least once a day (oops!) and it has never gotten a scratch and been damaged in this case! In fact, yesterday I was walking to my car, swinging my arms, and my phone slipped out of my hand and hurled toward my car window at around 10mph. I freaked out but when I turned my phone over it was completely unharmed! This case is sleek, unlike the otter box and it's easy to take on and off. Couldn't ask for a better product!
If you expect it to stay that cool clear color, within about six months of abuse, it turns to a dirty yellowish color as most ploys tend to do so. If you have a black phone, not so noticeable (that's what I have), but if you have a white one, I strongly urge you to avoid this. Within no time, you sleek white phone will look like it has a weird yellowish hue to it. Save yourself and buy a white or other solid case, or a hard clear plastic case.
Not sure abt Att models (those may be the people w the complaints). This fits my Sprint 4S perfect. So all those looking for protection w out covering up the phone with to much added bulk this is the best!! This with the powersupport hd anti glare film protector are the perfect combo!! Price is a little steep though for this here, but it does fit perfect with NO button pushing problems & shows the beauty of my white 4S perfectly..
I purchased this case as a replacement for a name brand slider case that cracked even though I've never dropped my phone. It is a nice case because it doesn't hide the beauty of the iPhone like the slider did. Contrary to what other reviews my say, the fit for the Verizon iPhone is spot on and the power and volume buttons are easy to push. It goes on easily and fits and lines up perfectly and the feel and grip are just right. Also I haven't had any issues with the cameras flash with the redesigned camera cut out. This is a revised version of the original Grip Vue case and maybe the problems stated in some of the reviews here were with the original design. I find it to be the perfect iPhone 4 case
The case was either packaged wrong and had an AT&T iPhone 4 case in box or it's just not made right to fit Verizon's iPhone 4. When I went to return the case, the employee assisting me had said that this case has been coming back (returned) a lot because of design. I didn't bother to have them check & the employee didn't offer to check if it was indeed packaged wrong due to it being an item that was returned a lot. Had it fit, I probably would've liked it.
Easy? Yes. Clear for a white iPhone? Yes. Protective? In some ways. The fit and finish is lacking. It's loose at the top and bottom and tends to get even more loose with use. I would recommend it to someone who is in need of a temporary protection solution while finding a better longer lasting one. Overpriced for what you get.
Finding the right case for your phone can be tough. This is my 4th and hopefully final case. This case is durable and well made. It's not too thick and fits the phone comfortably. What I like most about this case is that it actually makes the iPhone comfortable to hold in your hand.
I bought one for both myself and my wife. After putting the phone in the case I was unable to utilize the volume or lock buttons with any amount of ease if at all. The volume buttons were extremely difficult to depress. The case also caused the lock button to depress without even being touched by my hand. I did not feel like returning them so I cut out the buttons with a hobby knife and this eliminated the problems. However the case still does not fit precisely enough and this is visible along the front edges of the case on the face of the phone.
I first purchased the same Belkin clear case for my iPad. I received many compliments and I was pleased with its appearance and slim design. I then purchased this case for my iPhone. After a few months both cases (iPad and iPhone) started turning a weird yellowish/brown color. The cases started out as a 'clear' or frosty clear look. I've tried hand washing the cases without success. Just yesterday, my friend asked if my iPhone case was gold. That tells you how much the color changed.
I bought this product when i got my phone i got one of those invas. shields to put on it waited a day for it to settle then i put the case on and the case started to pull the screen up and make air bubbles.
This Belkin iPhone 4 case is a GREAT case to show off your stylish iPhone! It's not bulky, but it is protective. Who wants to pay $200 - $300 for a phone that they cover up with some other expensive, bulky, army-like protective case?
This case fits on the Verizon iPhone 4 perfectly, Its slim, all the buttons work great and are accessible. Really Keeps the phone looking new. Only thing wrong is that I have to take it out of the case to plug into my docking station. Not too sure about how protective it is but I have dropped it once and no damage was done.
Does the job and not bulky, Price is good. Easy to handle. Has a good feel. Has handled some hard knocks and done its job.
magically and gradually changes color from clear to brownish yellow - if they could find a way to build it with better materials resistant to rotting i a mere 30-60 days it would be a great product. Too bad the only case i prefer doesnt last more than 2-4 weeks before it looks older than my iphone 1 case i still have from 8 years ago
We debated back and forth on which phone to get. iPhone, Android, Windows Phone etc. A couple of things helped the iPhone win out. The biggest is surprisingly was the ability to know if and when my phone would be able to be updated to the latest version of the software. After dealing with the ambiguity of Android and Windows phone updates or lack there of for products that are being sold right now made for a pretty easy decision. Not having to wait for a carrier or manufacture to change things for their device is a good thing. The second thing that stood out was the build quality of the phone. From the aluminum to the glass it was the attention to detail that really stood out for us when the decision came. I think once you own and Apple product and get to play with it for a bit you start to notice these small things which when added up become big things. All in all we are delighted with our purchase and Best Buy made the buying experience a good one.
Love the iPhone. Bought it because it was on sale. Love Apple products. My only complaint is that it should be a little bit more durable. I don't use mine without a case.
Simply put: Every member of our immediate family uses an iPhone. We use them for calls, texts, emails, shopping, weight watchers, games, reading product reviews, comparing prices, news, real time stock updates, weather, Facebook, alarms, calendars and on and on and on. The list goes on...
So far, so good. new to smart phones. getting used to it but the ease of navigation is something i find very helpful.
This phone exceeds my expectations. It's much faster then the 3GS. The screen is really clear and it's just amazing.
The phone is great and does not crash like my Android. The only thing I hate was I wanted a 16G and this was the only iPhone they had. I cannot believe it.....
I really like my new iPhone 4 but this is my first smart phone and I am still learning to use it. My fingers are big and I am having trouble with the keyboard, and the battery life is annoyingly short - other than that I have no complaints so far.
Great phone. Love everything about it. Cannot believe I waited so long to get one of these.
Good phone, wish it was able to get 4 g internet service.
I was one to "only" make and receive phone calls on my previous cell phone. I didn't text! But once I got an email to purchase an iPhone at a discounted rate and my husband gave him one at his job, I decided to try the iPhone 4 and OMG, I didn't know a phone could be so nice. I went from a Razer to an iPhone and I wouldn't go back at all. I'm even looking forward to the iPhone update this fall. I'm now hooked on the iPhone but don't tell my family!
This is a very easy phone to use. Has a lot of very useful features.
I bought this phone to replace my wife's 3gs iPhone. She is very impressed with the screen resolution, she had trouble reading emails and texts before, but now she has no trouble at all.
It was easy to decide to upgrade to an iPhone. I have AT&T so the phone is very fast when using the Internet. I love the iCloud for all my devices.
I love this phone and the price was incredible at Best Buy. $49!!!! I really good price.
Glad I upgraded from iPhone 3G to iPhone 4. I can't imagine doing without it. Completely satisfied.
generally happy with product - more info on use would be helpful at time of purchase -
Don't like the phone, but is to late to change it. If I could I will just go back to a regular phone
First i-phone - liking the product! Very intuitive and easy to figure out. Besides if I can't figure it out - every person in town has one and I can just ask them. Like the continuous showing of the messages and the intuitiveness put into this device.
Just make sure to get some insurance - a screen protector & hard case (or bumper) and you are good to go! Apple products rock.
Great phone! Easy to use. Camera takes great pictures!
I just got my first iPhone a month ago and it is wonderful so simple and easy to use. Apps are easy to access and download. Love it!
Easy to use and the camera is awesome. Definitely great for beginners or any apple lover
She reluctantly accepted technology and now she loves it. This is her first smart phone, but she was semi-familliar with iOs.
It's lighter than the Blackberry Torch and the pictures are much clearer. The apps seem easier to get to and there are a lot more to get.I'm still learning to get around in it.
This is the best phone on the market.... If you don't have an Iphone you don't have a phone, enough said.
I got this phone on 2/17. I was so excited since I have family in other parts of the world I could video chat on the go. I went from an HTC Android OS to this phone. I don't think there's a phone that has better screen quality than this phone but after that you can find the rest in much better quality in a another android phones. This phone is great for gaming, productivity, videos and messaging. I really like the OS that comes with this phone. I was sad when I saw that the camera is very grainy and the flash doesn't help much when dark, I take pictures all the time and I am used to good quality but this phone doesnt deliver in that. Also I am bad with directions and I dont like to look at my phone when driving and this phone doesn't have navigation it only comes with google maps which you have too keep looking at, if you want a navigator for this phone you have to pay monthly or buy one from the appstore which can cost a lot.
I can't believe I waited this long to get an iPhone. I love it!
Love my iphone 4 This is our 4th iphone for the family. Have had them since they came out. Highly recommend.
Nice phone. Easy to use. Allows for multi-tasking and easy navigation.
I switch all the way out from Sprint to ATT due to lack of coverages and dropped calls and from HTC Evo to Iphone this was a difficult transition because I have to get use to the differences in the apps. With android apps all you have to do is download with apple you have to use a password everytime. Battery life is way better also there were some apps I loved on the android market that are not on the apple apps but the cell service is great now that it is unlimited mobile to mobile.
I like this phone I can turn off the 3G to just use wifi did saves me money That way I can get the 200MB plan it's just $15 a month thanks apple for a grate phone.!
This phone does it all! Didn't realize what I had been missing!
This is the second Iphone Ive had and have been very pleased with both of them. I'm not really a very "techy" type and I like the fact that this is a very user friendly phone. It does what I want and need it to and so much more. I did try the Motorolla Android and wasn't happy with it and went back to my Iphone. It's definately the phone of choice for me.
Would like to be able to get someone quicker when I have questions or can't figure out how to do something, rather than try & find it online! Otherwise I'm very happy with the IPhone 4.
after exactly 32 days the home button stopped working, best buy wouldn't change it, apple changed it for a refurbished phone (please read reviews online about refurbished phones and their problems, i personally had my iPhone change for a refurbished one 2 years back, that apple had to change it 4 times till they were able to find a refurbished phone that works without problems, and i think the last one i ended with is not refurbished from the serial number). do u think apple is fair??????? NO!!! I am not happy for sure, maybe i will not buy an apple product again!
I have an iPod Touch so I knew the interface very well. I love how easy everything on the IPhone is and how fun it is to use. Sometimes I just swipe things because I can. SWIPE SWIPE. the end.
I was going from a blackberry bold to a touch screen. I first tried a Motorola ATRIX... My typing on it was horrible and I had this fear that I was not gonna be able to do a touch screen at all, but I loved all that the Android could do... When I went to trade in my phone before the 30 day remorse period was up, I got discouraged that there was no quality phone with a keyboard at at&t best buy section in store, I wanted to go through best buy for my phone... I went home with reluctantly an HTC Status and disliked it as well... My fiance had an iphone 3gs and let me try to type and text on his and I did perfectly fine on his phone, it wasn't hard at all... I sent between me and my mom together on our plan about 10,000 texts a month so I need something i can text on... So I went out and got my iphone4 for $99... I wish it would put stuff on the wall like android does and run it like the facebook feed and the weather degrees updated and all that kind of stuff, it would be absolutely perfect then, but i can manage having to go into the app and wait for it to quickly load... I'm still new too... I wish you could have themes I am a theme person as well...
This phone is great for me. I don't need all the bells and whistles that some of these phones have. But I still like being able to facetime my son when he is away. I also like to check the ESP a lot. This is a simple phone that has all my music and a few apps and I love it.
Great battery life, and much better sound than the previous IPhone. I also like the long battery life. I only have to charge it every couple of days. No complaints.
I bought two of these for my family plan and have had zero complains. 8GB is enough for a lot of people and it worked for us!
Excellent design, the chamber, I love apple?sdfdtyhtryhdgh rhytshrfyh hyytrhryhr
This phonne is great to keep you organized as well as up to date on your business aspects on the go
Really enjoy the 4 since I upgraded from a 3gs. I can't wait to see the 5
I Phone 4 is a great phone after buying this you will not buy any other brand it got everything great apps,camera,iTunes etc etc etc I ,m sure you will not regret if you spend money on this phone we all have I phone 4 in our family everybody love it.
Love this phone. Wonderful upgrade from my old 3G.
I am extremely pleased with my iPhone 4. Going from my former flip phone to a phone that I can do everything and more on that I do on my PC is as different as night and day. I enjoy the ease of photo taking and the opportunity to obtain super apps.
This product exceeds what I thought it would be. I would recommend this product to everyone I know!
Great product from apple!! You can do or check whatever you need to know! I love this iphone :)
I've always been a PC and android user, but have been debating switching to apple for a long time now. I finally decided to get the iPhone 4 after trading in my HTC Evo 4G, to test it out myself. I don't know why this is happening, but my iPhone seems to be falling apart after 2 days of getting it new out of the box. My volume down button is already not working. It doesn't click, it doesn't do anything. It is not in contact with the case at all, so that isn't the problem. Also, a majority of my apps stopped working as well. When I click them they start to shift, but it goes right back to the home screen. I've tried restarting multiple times and app killing, but neither worked. I hope I don't have to uninstall and install every time I want to open an app! Anyway, I'm going back into the store today to get some questions answered. Hopefully they can fix this.
Looked to do upgrade from iPhone 3 for better picture quality and got it. Didn't need the S capabilities so the iPhone 4 was perfect for needs.
iphone makes a great computer/mobile phone/camera/organizer, even though it is still an i4
Replaced blackberry, easier to use, more app options..
love the iphone screen resolution... video calling feature is awesome!!! i didnt regret i switch to iphone... thanks apple!!!
Can't think of anything negative to say about my iPhone 4. I bought it at a great price. It is easy to navigate to any place on the web that I need to go. It was easy to sync with my iPad 2. I can't leave home without it. If I should----I have to go back and get it. I use it in too many ways to mention. Great piece of technology!
Great first smart Phone. I would recommend to others.
I thought the iPhone is supposed to be awesome. I mean it is a good phone but my sister has a Galaxy and her pictures and screen seem to much better.
I like the ease of use and the capabilities. It makes organizing life simple.
I avoided jumping on the Apple bandwagon for a long time because of the expense and the uber-trendy thig, but now - I want more Apple products like the Ipad. This phone is great.
When I unplug it at 5:00 am to get ready for work and don't get home till like 2:30 pm the battery life is still at 96% with me doing alot of texting. And the way it text is amazing you can't misspell
Great phone hor daughter. Keeps her updated with e-mails.
Over all pretty good, but its an apple. My Trend Micro antivirus doesn't support Mac mobile OS devices. Wish I had gone with Android <(:-{/)
This is a great phone even when it came out a few years ago. Now, with it being offered "free" with a two year contract, it is definitely worth an upgrade. I like the sleek front and back and the very easy to use interface. It is reliable and works whenever and wherever.
This is by far the best smartphone I've purchased in the past three years. I love it!!!!
I owned an iPhone 3GS previously and was excited to upgrade to the 4, it did not disappoint.
I really wish I would have kept my old iPhone or splurged for the 4S. Not worth the savings. I always have to delete apps to allow others to update which i've never had to do before this phone.
I love the iPhone. I tried another smart phone before buying the iPhone but I traded it in because I didn't like the apps compared to what this phone offers.
Love that I can get and send email. Love that I have access to the internet
My son just loves his new iphone. It is extremely user friendly even for an 11 year old.
I picked this case because it was one of the cheapest as well as one of the thinnest ones I could find. I've dropped my phone twice that I can remember and it has protected it extremely well. Its easy to get the phone in and out of it (which I did a lot of when I first got my iPhone to show it off to people).
If you want a slim lightweight case with minimalist design this is an excellent choice. The case edges do not project above the plane of the screen so a dropped phone which lands face first is not protected
I bought this case at the end of October. It is a very slim, nice looking case but after having the case for less than 6 weeks, it is already cracking and breaking. I have never dropped my phone so I'm not sure I what has caused this to happen. This is a poor quality case and I would not recommend buying it.
This case is very thin, which make it less bulky if you tend to carry your iphone in your pockets. Other than that, not sure how well it would hold up if you were to drop your iPhone. The case doesn't wrap around the entire face of the iPhone, only the corners. So if you drop it on the face or onto something directly on the side, your iPhone might get damaged. The silver case looks very nice, especially with a white iPhone. For what you pay, the value is okay, but what you're paying for for this case is a lightweight, slim, aesthetically pleasing silver case. If that's what you're looking for, I'd recommend it. If you're looking for more protection than looks, don't get this.
I totally recommend this product if you like funky, loud things that make a bold statement. If you are looking for sound quality and tons of features this is not for you! Also the lights flash and blink accordingly with the beats of the songs... pretty cool! I love this thing....even though it is a bit too pricey!
I really like my boombox. I can't think of anything negative about it. Highly recommend it !!!
I'm not sure why this has bad ratings. I have had several slider cases and snug cases and this one is the best so far. I like the design and really like how the bottom and top of the case are cut out a bit. this allows for head phones and aux cables to fit freely. My last slider case had to be removed in order to use the non-apple headphones I liked. I like the metal inlay as well and does a nice job sliding in and out of your pocket.
More resistent than plastic but still not a good price
Cons: The aluminum inlay blocks the iPhone's already fragile antenna and causes a poor voice reception and off and on 3G connectivity. Pros: The case stays on and in place. It is tough to get off but that is a plus for a case. It's smooth and sleek and feels really good. Unfortunately I am returning it later today. I have to have reception on my phone. It's what I bought it for. Next time I will buy an all plastic or rubber case, no more metal ones even if it is just an aluminum inlay. It played hell with the reception.
Its a good looking case but its really hard to take the phone out of it once its in
Works ok but it doesn't quite fit the 4S. It appears to not be wide enough on the back and so one side seems to be always about to pop off. Otherwise it works fine just not happy with fit.
I purchased this case a few months back. I was really pleased with it for the first few days.The colors were vibrant and it seemed very durable. Emphasis on SEEMED. Within two weeks the fabric looked filthy and disgusting--there's no easy way to clean it. The fabric also began to fray at the bottom corners and peel off all together. In less than a month the top left corner of the case was deformed and didn't hug the phone or the corner of the screen anymore. I'm typically very careful with my phone and I have had an iPhone for over two years without any cracked or even scratched screens. The phone fell off my lap and fell onto a concrete floor [MAYBE a distance of a foot and a half]. Because the left corner wasn't protected well anymore the screen in that corner was shattered and also caused a large crack down the left side of my phone screen. Had a better case been on it my screen would not be cracked! I contacted Speck to complain because I felt the case was defective. They simply told me if I sent back the case with the receipt they would replace the case. Obviously, I do not want another Speck case. I feel their name is vastly overrated and they're extremely overpriced. I will NEVER purchase another product of theirs--and I'll never recommend them to anyone.
Didn't realize that it does not include headphone clip on band that other color of same style includes at equal price. Also would be great if touchscreen window was a hair wider, case overlaps enough to just barely block last couple millimeters when trying to do the unlock phone swipe.
Works as expected -- note that if you use a "plastic" type screen protector it will get "stuck" and not easily be removed from the holder. My protector was wearing out so I took it off and it works fine.
So I don't know if I just got unlucky with this case, but my experience with this is horrible. I always use my iphone for working out and the thing about this case is that is does not stay on my arm. Whatever I do, it always starts coming down my arm, especially when I am running and I have to keep stopping and adjusting my arm strap. It sucks! I have not yet found a case that I am satisfied with..
This is a great case for someone who needs to set their phone on a slick surface and have it stay in place. It's only downfall is that it traps dirt, and needs to be removed and washed with dish soap daily.
I like the way it feels and would recommend it to a friend!
If you are going to put your phone in the hands of an 18 month old, I recommend this cover. However, it will take time to learn to deal with the deeply recessed buttons. Also if you carry your phone in your jeans/pants pocket it tends to pull everything out with it. This is because of the friction between the rubber cover and whatever is in your pockets. So there you go, great protection but you have to put up with bulk, friction, and slightly more difficult reach buttons.
Overall, it's a great iPhone cover, and I say that with conviction, as it's the only one i've ever owned.
product was too flimsy and didnt fit very snug on my I-phone. although some liked it and recommened it to me. It just wasn't what I expected
Overall this case works quite well. It's easy to grip, even when wet and protects the phone from accidental drops. The only issue is the difficulty of connecting the cable for syncing or charging. The cut out for the cable connector is a bit smalll and must be manipulated to connect a cable. I found that removing the case from the phone is required. It's a small issue but could have been avoided by design.
Overall I was not impressed with this item. Although it is rigid and seems to provide ample protection, and it comes with a screen protector film, to me it wasn't good enough. The bottom piece that slides on wouldn't stay put. When pulling it out of my pocket, I would either just pull it off, or the bottom piece would get left behind in my pocket. Also, this case has such sharp edges that it wouldn't fit in my car holder. I am not sure if the bottom falling off was a design flaw, or maybe just a flaw with the particular one I purchased. Be sure to check it out before purchasing. I ended up taking it back and bought the Belkin Essential 050 case. Much happier.
I will be returning my lifeproof case I purchased today! I'm not impressed with the screen protection anything could easy put a hole or a rip in it. I feel if you dropped this case with your phone in it in the water and it hit a rock or hard sufface it would pop open and then you could say bye bye to your phone. I would buy a underwater camera/video camera before buying this and spend more money then spending $79.99 on this and losing $199.99 on your iphone. I hope this helps dont buy this product is review is from a person that want protection!!!!
I tested my case as mentioned in the directions for leaks, and it worked perfectly. I was able to use my phone under water multiple times. I swam with it in the lake, filmed Tarpon at the dock under water in the Keys, swam with it offshore; however, on a swim in waist deep water at the beach a very small amount of moisture leaked into the case. The result was an iPhone that doesn't turn off, the front camera doesn't focus, and accelerated battery usage. The very small water droplets were able to bypass the membrane near the earpiece speaker. I did check the condition and security of the case before entering the water. Each water use was limited to no more than 5 feet. A quote from lifeproof.com ~ "LifeProof warranty does not, under any circumstance, cover the replacement or cost of any electronic device or personal property inside or outside of the case. " I write this review as a caution to you. The case will work as advertised a majority of the time, but I would be careful in using it as a primary underwater camera like I did. I should have used my cheap Fuji for that. Good luck.
This is my first iPhone and after seeing a demonstration of an iPhone sitting in a bowl of water for 15 minutes coming out fully functional and DRY I decided to spend the money. A bonus is that I wouldn't need to purchase an expensive ZAGG screen and body protector, a $30 savings! Lifeproof admonishes new users to NOT use a screen protector for the reasons listed on their website www.lifeproof.com/support. On their website you will have the opportunity to upgrade your warranty to 1 year for FREE by taking a simple quiz on the product. The good thing is that while fishing the other day my phone must have fallen out of my tackle box because I saw it laying at the waters edge covered in mud and most definitely submerged. NO DAMAGE! The phone was bone dry and fully functional. NICE! The NOT SO GOOD THING is that you are not warned that your standard charging/data cable will not work with the case, and you must purchase an adapter, or remove the case (not recommended) every time you want to charge or sync your phone. At the price charged they could have been more forthcoming or even better, provided the adapter FREE OF CHARGE. Accessories are over priced, so do some shopping for the best deals ... Hope this helped a little ... paul
This cover did not work!!! My son dropped his iPhone in the pool and it is ruined!!! I contacted the company and the only thing they will do id replace the cover!!! So he is going to have to pay 500 dollars to replace his iPhone. Maybe this product works most of the time and he just had a defective one but don't pay 80 bucks for something that may not even work and for sure you should not trust that it will!!!!
if your thinking about getting one, don't think about it just buy one. Trust me I had my phone no more then 4 hours and it fell in the pool and this thing saved my phone.
This is super protective but the sacrifices are major: you can't plug in earphones and the cover blocks the sound. It also adds substantial weight and bulk to what was a sleek phone.
Case works great and is comfortable. It seems to do what is most important - keep the water away. It will definitely help with a longer life. Worth the money. If you are thinking of buying a screen protector and case, this case does both (better) and for the same price or less. Get it.
I think any customer should expect something that lives up to promises made when a phone case costs $86.49 after taxes. I didn't purchase to take underwater photos, I just wanted to protect my phone as I have a habit of dropping and spilling. Unfortunately, this case is of poor quality. The membrane that "protects" the ear speaker is just about the flimsiest piece of junk I've ever seen. Not only that, there is absolutely no warning about this. Mine developed a small hole and now that hole allows water or dust or whatever right throught the case. The best part is that Lifeproof will not do anything for me since I "must have damaged the equipment." Right, I have nothing better to do than purposely damage a $90 phone case and then try to get anyone to act honorably towards a paying customer. GARBAGE.
After trashing several Otterbox's I decided to step it up a notch and get a tougher iphone case. After lots of research I decided the Lifeproof was the phone case for me since I work in AG and deal with dust, water, drops, bumps and accidents on a daily basis. I first fell in love the case and thought I had a case that would finally last more than two weeks. Wrong. The first case lasted exactly 43 days before the charging port broke shortly after a pin hole appeared in the speaker cover, allowing dust to get into the case. I purchased a second and tested it just as required for waterproofness and it lasted somewhere around two months before yet another hole appeared allowing more dust into the case. Then to top it off just today it fell out of my truck into dirt and cracked the screen on my phone. I will never buy another one and if you work outside more than a few hours a day then dont waste your time or money.
We bought this case for the iPhone 4s for it's waterproofing capabilities as my husband fishes a lot. However, today he left the phone on the hood of my Explorer and low and behold it fell off and he ran over it. He hear the crunch and thought the worst. At first glance, it seemed as though the phone was trashed. The plastic screen protecter had holes in it from the rocks on the road. However, after removing the case the iPhone did not have one scratch on it. We will definitely be getting another one. Apparently it protects the phone from impact as well as water. Great case!
Love the new colors and really works. Dropped by phone in sink on mistake and zero damage
I used the cover for an offshore fishing trip and I loved it. My phone worked like a charm, able to use touch screen without difficulty but the volume was a liitle muffled other than that loved it
I purchased and had the LifeProof case on my iPhone 4 for about 3 weeks, and it's going back today. The case is extremely durable (shockproof) and was, in my experience, 100% waterproof. Actually took video underwater in my friends pool and was tossing it in the pool while the video was shooting and letting the younger kids dive down to retrieve it. You really have to be careful putting the case on your phone to make sure that it's completely snapped into place and that the yellow o-ring that surrounds the phone is in the proper channel......after you do that, it's 100%. Humidity does put some moisture inside the case, and the case screen can stick to the phone screen. However durable, the day to day with this case is completely annoying. To use the headphone port, you have to carry around their adapter that screws into the case. Forget that adapter and you can forget using your headphone port, too, without taking the case completely off. Also, the charging port is sealed, but in order to achieve this, the plastic that surrounds it was designed to such tight tolerances that only the Apple cord that came with the phone is small enough to fit into it. If you like to use and aftermarket cord or any device with an iPhone base......again, forget it. It won't fit. I even purchased extension cords from an aftermarket source to relieve the base issue, and the heads were too big for the LifeProof case. Because of this, the case rendered all other cords and bases useless, including my vehicle charger and made it a requirement to carry an Apple specific cord in order to charge/transfer the phone. Buy more cords, you say. . . . . ? Not for $28 a piece for the Apple brand cords. All in all, if you are a ritual beach goer that needs day to day protection from things like sand and water, and your desire is to shoot underwater video with your iPhone.....have at it, this is the case for you. If you want to do anything else with it. . . . .forget it.
After all the rave reviews about the development budget used to produce the Lifeproof case and all the wonderful things it can protect your phone from I spent the extra $$$ over like cases. Wrong answer, charging port door which does not allow anything other than the stock charging cable to be inserted into it has broken in little over a month. The included headphone adapter which is required if you want to use anything other than the stock apple headphones is so poorly made it fails after 2 weeks of use, I'm on my second adapter already. The headphone port is protected by a little screw in cap that can be placed in a little plastic holder while headphones are being used. DO NOT USE THE INCLUDED HOLDER it will fall off your headphones before you can say "what the ...". The case has great potential and I really want it to work, unfortunately there were major quality control issues not addressed in production and I fear the company is in some serious trouble if too many people are requiring as many warranty replacements as I am. I'm guessing they are facing major issues as their service department takes ages to respond to issues via email and are near impossible to reach at their support phone line.
I've used a lot of cases for my iPhone 4S by Otterbox, Incase, Sena and Speck but Lifeproof is the best. This is the only case that is light and thin but covers 100% of the area around the device. My only negative is that at $80.00 it should include the belt clip, which is currently a separate $30.00 purchase.
This product is about as "lifeproof" as a piece of paper. For one i wasted my money and $80 is way overpriced. Also it only lasted me 4 days before it completely ruined my iphone. This is because after following all the proceduers and checking the seal the seal faile and let water in my iphone. And guess what they wont give me the money for a new one even though it is guranteed water proof. Dont buy because if your phone breaks you are out of luck. Sincerely, Angry customer
So far so good, I have not dropped it yet. The sales associate did throw his across the floor (wood) and his phone was fine. If it protects that well I'll be happy.
Overall very good case. Would be more useful if it had a built in extended battery.
I have considered replacing it with a standard case but will probably not do so.
I absolutely love my case. I daringly tested it in the Guadeloupe River yesterday and it worked splendidly. It was very light to carry, but I would have loved to have a lanyard slot. I was able to talk on the phone as well while floating the river. The picture quality was great because of the iPhone camera, but the case doesn't hold on to the beads of water as much meaning less water spots. I love the case too because I can accidentally drop it in the sink or on the ground, and not have to cry about it. Granted I haven't done anything like run it over with a car, but realistically I'd pay $80 to protect a $600 phone that has a limited protection warranty. Now I don't have to worry about shattered glass or water damage. This is also an awesome investment if you tend to sweat a lot because it protects the speaker from water (hence waterproof * up to 6.5 ft.) Totally worth the money, and I like that the screen isn't too crazy different. It does have a little difference in the feel of the touch screen, but it wasn't like how my Griffen Survior Case was. I could text the same and hear the same out of the phone.
Well, I have been using it all week on my vacation in Punta Cana, but all of the sudden I went to take a picture and the shots where coming out cloudy..... basically, the phone did not get "wet" but somehow moisture got into the phone and now there are little droplets of water inside by the rear camera..... I really hope this does not effect my warranty, but Lifeproof will be hearing from me about this. I do admit it works and the phone did not get flooded, but this moisture issue concerns me.
I like the case as I am outdoors a lot however, with the lifebox on my phone, it created a horrible echo on the other end of the conversation. regardless of me initiating the call or the call coming in and regardless of who it was there was an echo on their end of the conversation. I attempted a remedy provided by the lifebox website which seemed to make the situation worse. I had to go with an otterbox. It is not completely waterproof but there is no echo for those at the other end of my conversations
You figure for $80.00 you would get something that beats an Otterbox. Not true! Once I took this item out of the box I couldn't believe they charge this much money. You can instantly tell that this thing wouldn't survive a drop, it is thin plastic with 0 scratch protection. The back of the case has fins that will most definitely damage your phone after prolonged use. The plastic screen on the front just looks horrible, a shiny piece of plastic with bumps in it. You cannot use most 3rd party power adapters as it will not fit, and forget about placing in in any type of cradle device. I bought this thinking it would be great to have when I kayak, I am returning and using a sturdy case and a waterproof bag from now on. They should be ashamed for charging so much.
My first iPhone 4s ended up in a wash. So I got this case for the second 4s. I haven't had the guts to test the waterproof ability with the phone but it did past the recommend hour long pre-phone insert test. My gripe is that sound now gets distorted if the ringer/volume is up too high. It kind of sounds like a blown speaker since the thin film of plastic (screen) on the front vibrates. The case (which the manufacturer touts as an 'amplifier') does amplify but the sound gets muddy. It's a small price to pay for the protection.
1 - I did not do the water test, simply because I did not believe that it would survive and did not want a damaged phone on day one. 2 - I did have to shave my Verizon car charger down to fit inside the case opening. Off-brand chargers fit but the Verizon was too large to fit in the opening. 3 - DO NOT DROP YOUR PHONE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 4 - DO NOT DROP YOUR PHONE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 5 - DO NOT DROP YOUR PHONE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! THIS CASE WILL NOT STOP YOUR PHONE FROM SHATTERING WHEN YOU DROP IT FROM PASSING IT FROM ONE PERSON TO ANOTHER AT AROUND 3-1/2 - 4 FEET HIGH. It may say "Shock" proof but maybe they meant bump proof. Just don't bump it off of your table... After spending way too much for this case, I am left with a repair bill and a piece of junk case that I will not recommend to anyone. This is not all LifeProof's fault... but no one from there will pay to fix my phone that broke in their case either... Recommendations.... take your pick, I do not think any case will stop a phone with glass on the front and back from shattering when dropped, even from a low height. Good Luck!!!!
Here I was so stoked about getting this case!! Well, thank goodness for the water test!! Put case together as directed did the water test. And when I was done it was wet on the inside of the screen. How disappointing! Will be getting refund in the am!!
I recently purchased my first iPhone. Having a toddler at home, I was concerned about protecting the phone. Life proof claims to protect against Water, dirt, snow and shock. Priced above all the rest, and with claims above the others, I purchased it. My assumption that it was the best was quickly proven wrong. After carefully reading the instructions, conducting the water proof test and assembling it exactly as it stated, I was excited with this new case. It looked great. After having it for 3 days...that's right, only 3 days... I dropped my phone. I wasn't kayaking down a river or hiking a mountain, just walking down the hallway at the hospital. It slipped out of my hands and the piece covering the power source busted off and went flying. What a piece of junk! Thankfully, this happened within the first 30 days and Best Buy returned it without hassle. Lesson learned...high price doesn't always mean high quality!
I purchased the Lifeproof case for my son's Iphone that he got for Christmas. We watched the tutorials and took the test required to activate the 365 day warranty on Lifeproof's website. My son did exactly what one of the demos shows you can do and video taped underwater. His iPhone no longer works. Best Buy will not refund $$ because I am 12 days past their 30 day return policy. Lifeproof will not refund my money because I didn't buy it from them. Lifeproof will replace the case. Yippee!! I don't have anything to use the case with since their stupid product didn't protect it!! So now we are out the $80 to purchase the case and the cost of the iPhone. I would never recommend this product to anyone!
I love the case for the waterproof aspect, and it seems to be somewhat protected from minor drops. However, the buttons are stiff and take two hands to power down and to switch from sound to vibrate (or back again). The design of the hinge over the port plug area doesn't allow the phone to sit in a docking station, making it unusable if you wish to have it sit in a portable speaker system or car dock. The ear bud plug is also too narrow for my car's tape player adapter too, so the phone can't be used for music while I drive.
The bad part is that the holster will scratch the mess out of the Case screen. Also you have to use the small apple charger to charge your phone, and lastly if you like to plug a AUX or headphone cable into your iPhone in the car or the gym you have to have the headphone screw adapter to listen to music. I got this case when I first purchased my phone and it sounded awesome, and it is. I work in a industrial mill, so a lot of rush and water, nothing penetrated the case to the phone. So that all is great.
I had purchased this case when I first got a 4s but returned it because I thought it was kind of big, not wide like the otter defender, but taller than the phone. I also wasn't as in to fishing as I am now, so thought the inconvenience for having a water-proof phone was not worth it. I returned it and got a HD screen protector and a couple of other cases. I went fly fishing the other day and had my phone(with otter defender case) in my jeans pocket underneath my waders. I took a misstep and fell causing the waders to become anchors. Surprisingly, the phone was ok...... some condensation in the camera lens but thats about it. Thats when I decided that I need to give this case another try. With such an expensive phone it makes sense to spend the money on an almost bulletproof case instead of spending 6 times the amount on a new iphone when you drop yours in the water.
I placed a facial tissue in the closed case and kept the case under water overnight just to see--and the tissue was dry! So then I put my phone in it, but I didn't test it. ;) It does make your iPhone a bit longer, but it still fits in the places I need to, to carry it around. Bummer that I can't just place this on my docking station/speakers, or charge with a non-Apple cable, but hey, when you've dumped two iPhones in water in 1 month, you decide it's time to get a waterproof case. Touch screen accessibility is fine, speakerphone is fine. Have to push a bit to use the power button at the top, but I'm getting used to that. If you're looking for a waterproof case to take your iPhone with you around water--this is a great case! Sleek, waterproof, and the phone is usable just like you would with most any other case.
I purchased this case and the special screw in head phone connector and the special waterproof headphones. I jumped into the pool and immediately noticed that the phone was acting up. I got out and opened the case to some water. At the bottom one of the speaker screens had popped open and allowed water in to ruin my phone. LIFEPROOF does NOT warranty the electronics incased by their product. I am out of luck for their faulty case. DO NOT BUY THIS CASE
I love this case. I have taken it on different trips, even into the river. I love taking photos underwater. I never have to worry if it's raining. Or if my phone falls on the ground, I don't care. It just keeps going.
I like this case, but some of my accessories I already owned for my iPod Touch that I wanted to use with my iPhone do not work with it.
I've had water damage in the past and did not want to waste anymore money. So I purchased the LifeProof case. It is a bit expensive, but worth the money. I was quite surprised that it did not make the phone much bigger and the screen works great. I now have total confidence that I will not ruin my iphone, either from water or dropping it. No more scratches ruining the screen either. Only draw back is that you need an adapter to use earbuds and you must use an apple charger or purchase an adapter. Small set back for big benefits.
The case is well constructed and very small relative to the phone. So my small phone remains relatively small, as opposed to getting an Otterbox which seems to make it 25% larger. My biggest issue is that the case is watertight and so the charging port is covered and the opening is designed for a apple connector. My aftermarket auto charger won't fit. It also won't sit on my clock radio because of the port cover. To make this work you need to spend another $20 or so for a special adaptor. You can't leave it in or its not watertight any more. So this is a piece I now need to carry to the car, or home. Or you can buy a few of them @ $20 ea. Alternatively you can ditch the aftermarket chargers and purchase all Apple products.
Having had an Otterbox Defender for years, I finally wanted something fresh. The price of this case is steep, but there was really nothing else from my research that could hope to top the Defender like the Lifeproof. The case is better than I expected. It's waterproof, slim, and has better visual clarity of the screen than the Defender. One of my favorite features is what Lifeproof calls the "Sound Enhancement System," which causes the rear of the case to act as a speaker and enrich the bass of your music. I was surprised to find that my iPhone was in fact louder in the case than caseless. Call quality is perfectly fine and I've had no complaints from the other end. I wouldn't trust this case to drops like the Defender, but it's slimmer design, richer sound, and waterproof ability makes it a contender in my book. I cannot speak to their customer service, but Otterbox has the best customer service I've ever dealt with and that in my mind makes the choice between the two very hard. I give it a 4 out of 5 because of price and for the fact that the belt clip is an extra $30.
Does this product do what it claims to do? Absolutely. Is their customer support helpful? Absolutely. Does this product survive under high usage and wear and tear ... Not so much. I bought two cases. With the first case my opening and closing of the latch to charge my phone broke the gasket within 2 months. I wrote to their customer service department suggesting they work on the gasket and they offered to replace the front case without my even asking. Very kind of them but I declined as it wasn't that important to me. A week later my niece snapped the latch completely off and as I loved the case so much I bought a new one. Second case - I dropped the phone after 2 months and the only thing to break was the latch - completely useless now. I carry my phone in my pocket or lunch bag and the screen is scratched to almost unusable. I am a contractor and the phone/case is subjected to a lot of wear and tear. I expect to go through cases more than the average user, however, to replace a $79 case every two months is unrealistic. Most of my cases last 8-12 months at $19.99. Other contractors have recommended other cases that last significantly longer and until improvements are made I will be purchasing another brand. For a casual user that really takes care of their electronics I think this is the best case to own and wouldn't recommend anything else. It really is waterproof and more importantly dust proof. Additionally it enhances the speaker sound. For contractors or teens ... Look elsewhere, it will not last long enough to warrant the price.
This case is pretty nice overall. It's sturdy, it does protect the phone from shocks, it is waterproof and everything advertised is spot on. My downside is the charging port. Any aftermarket charging cables don't fit into the receptacle so I have had to improvise and purchase more Apple iPhone cords to compensate. I purchased the case because I have two twin infants at home who are now crawling. I use my phone all the time so it's usually not up out of their reach like it should be so inevitably it ends up in their mouths. After a scare with my iPhone where external sounds stopped working due to "water" getting in the headphone jack I knew I had to go looking for a better case. This case has solved that issue and now I can let the babies do whatever they want with the phone and not worry about it getting worried. Of couse I still try to keep things out of their reach and most certainly out of their mouths but just in case, we're good. I'd recommend this product to parents most certainly and as long as you test the case I can recommend it to those who want to take their phones underwater as well. If they were to fix the power cable receptacle this would be a 5-star review.
My daughter bought a brand new iphone and wanted this case for her protection. We followed the directions properly and she was excited to shoot a video in water, like they show in their videos - it destroyed the phone the very first time. Now, if customer service is important to you and a company that backs their product...well, this isnt the product for you. If you like companies that do false advertizing for their product, then buy right away. I called 3 times and no ONE would talk to me about their warranty - said a supervisor would and they would call me right away. 2 to 3 weeks later, I get a general email saying really nothing and that they are not liable. No returned call, as promised - and they wont discuss anything over the phone. HORRIBLE!!!! Stay away.
This case isn't without it's down sides, but the benefits for me far out weigh them. I've read some reviews about the case "failing" when dropped in water, but they probably failed to test the case prior to putting their phone in it, or weren't careful about how they put it on. I've had my case now for a few months, and actually use it in the shower almost every morning to listen to music while I get ready for work. I've also dropped my phone several times from anywhere from 3 feet, to 6.5 feet, and the case has handled every one of them without issues. I've worked around the headphone plug issue by getting some bluetooth headphones, and I use a port extender every night to plug my phone in to my alarm clock dock for charging. I agree it does seem flimsy, but I've had no issues with it so far, even though I thought I almost broke it more than once. I alos havea an "oil slick" on the screen that's a little annoying, but liveable. I took it appart, and recleaned it, but it came back, so I guess I'm stuck with it. I have noticed some change in call quality and picture quality, but nothing drastic, and it's still completely usable.
By far the best total protection for your iphone. It's not as bulky or heavy as other cases. The only downside for this product is the price, but its worth it if you have the money.
Sent to my brother-in-law as birthday gift. Bought one for myself and my kid-but warn you to test it before using. 1st one actually leaked some humidity and was replaced. Also had damage on the kid's one and was replaced under warranty directly with Lifeproof. Great product but always check it if you are going into the water.
I recently purchased this product from my local store and must say that if they had put just a little more thought and care into this product it might be worth the extremely high price they are asking, over 100 dollars if purchased with belt clip. The product itself seems as though it would be water proof but I have no real desire to test it as my primary concern is protecting my phone from drops for with the product seems as though it might far short of the protection offer by the otter box, as the exterior of this product is to ridged to absorb the energy of a fall. Overall, if water protection is you primary concern I would recommend this product, but if chock protection is what your conceded about go with the otter box or something similar.
Love this case, dont have to worry about my phone, ever!
had it for a month now.so far no issues.price can be better though.
I read so many reviews to try to make an educated purchase, and even after reading a few reviews that talked about the iPhones voice quality being altered by the LifeProof case, I decided to take the plunge and see for myself. Luckily, my local store had it in stock. I figured if I bought this case locally and had any problems with it, I could quickly exchange it without waiting for shipping. As soon as I got it home, I performed the water test as instructed by the LifeProof website and as expected, the case came through with flying colors. My real concern was to find out if there would be any voice quality issues, so I gave my iPhone a thorough cleaning and installed it into the LifeProof case. I don't know if the manufacturer corrected any earlier problems, or maybe the few people that have complained about an echo effect had a defective case, but after at least 25 calls, there is absolutely no change to the voice quality that people hear from my iPhone with the LifeProof case installed. I took several pictures both with and without the flash, and I'm extremely happy to report that there's no difference in the iPhone 4s camera quality with the LifeProof case installed. I consider myself to be a very discerning shopper and have to be extremely impressed with a product to leave a 5 star rating, but this case is definitely worth the high price tag. It's great to find a product that gets it right!!
I bought this case because it advertised water proof. I dropped the my phone in the 4 foot of water and the case failed. The warranty only covers the case not the phone. Terrible waste of money.
This case is bulletproof . It is a very good fit and adds minimal size to the phone. There are several accessories for this case as well. It has a nice bike mount kit and belt clip available.
This is an amazing case! Not meant for necessarily being in your pocket just the otter box. This case was designed to protect your phone not be fashionable and fit in your skinny jeans. It does what is supposed to do which is protecting your phone.
The cover was too thick interfered with reception and hearing the audio. I tested the reception and sound with and without the cover and decided this is not a good product. Also it will not work with any third party charge/sync cords since these are thicker and the width of the opening for the charging/syncing cable is based only on the Apple dimensions.
Already got it wet with a beer at the pool. Just wiped it off and it was just fine. love it.
Great case for your iPhone if you work or play around water.
Listen, this is an excellent case. However, I sold mine. The reason is this: I use my iPhone at home mounted to an iHome-type device. With the case on the iPhone it is impossible to mount this directly to anything. The reason is because the charging port/communications port is covered with a hinged contraption that is required to make the case waterproof. When opening the cover, it does not detach but is required to remain part of the cover. Therefore, this makes it impossible to mount to any device without an adapter. This is not necessarily a problem. The problem comes into play when you mount the iPhone still in the case with the adapter. It causes the mounted iPhone to be wobbly because it rests solely on that adapter which is about an inch and a half high. I overcame this by placing a support behind the iPhone. I did not feel comfortable leaving the iPhone in this wobbling position fearful that it would eventually cause damage to that port. The 2nd issue I ran into was that I connect my iPhone to the MIDI/iPod connector in my car. With the case in place, it requires the headphone adapter that comes with the case to be attached. This headphone adapter pushes into the headphone port and then screws down flush with the case. Again, this is a good thing because it causes the case to remain waterproof. But, when I get out of the car I do not want that six-inch headphone adapter cord dangling from my iPhone. Therefore, I have to unscrew the headphone adapter cord, reinsert the plug, and go on my merry way. Until, I get back in my car and have to repeat the process again. This case is wonderful if you do not intend to use headphones with iPhone or mounted to any device that you listen to the iPhone through speakers, or charge on the mounted device. Because I do this every day and every night, the case was more of a nuisance than of use to me. For example, my wife has the same case and all she does with her iPhone is read e-mail, iMessage, Facetime, and talk on the phone. She does not use headphones, and she uses the charging adapter that came with the iPhone. For her this case works. For me, it does not because I use attachments. This case has its purpose. It is to protect the phone as advertised. For this, it does a wonderful job. If you plan on attaching anything to this phone, I guarantee you this case will get in the way.
This case is perfect for the persone who is hard on their phones. It does everything it says. Very pleased with it
I had my Lifeproof for 5 weeks and it never worked properly. Always had to blow air into it so callers would not get feedback. The small plastic cap that goes over earphone opening can easily get lost. The worst was I accidentally dropped my phone from mid-thigh to wood floor. When I took off the Lifeproof case, my iPhone 4s had a very small mark and my iPhone features did not work where the mark was on the glass. I had to get a new iPhone and thankfully had Applecare. Lifeproof sent me a new case but there is no way I am going to use it on my iPhone. I am going to return the new Lifeproof they sent me back to the store. Your friends will dread calling you because of the constant feedback on the phone!
It don't stick to your pocket like the otter box Not as bulky either Would be nice for $99 with the clip
i am satisfied with this case. i have tested it and it seems to be waterproof. i havent tossed it up to see if the impact feature works but i hope that will never be intentional. i like that it is a slim case because i carry in my pocket very often. i researched a little before the purchase and wasn't able to find another case that had been military tested and was also waterproof. the only things that i have fround that i feel has room for improvment is the earphone plug that screws in the top has to be fully removed in order to use. problem is, is that it is very small and could easily be lost. wished it had some sort of lanyard to stay attached to the phone. second is that it seems to be harder to hear durning voice calls, at the ear piece and speaker in semi noisey enviroments. but the way i look at it is that i have traded that off for the phone to be protected and it be like a brand new one when i take it out of the case. the phone is complete protected from everything so it will look brand new once removed +
We got this for our daughter because she has been known to drop her phone in water. It is great in the fact it keeps the water/moisture from entering the phone and is able to take shocks that are cause from drops. Great if you have an active life style.
This was a gift to my boyfriend who does commercial flooring and constantly drops his phone and there is water and dirt. This case is perfect for him and prevents all debris from getting to his phone!
It works,best case ever for iphone.you must get one to and the belt clip is as equally as good.
The concept is good for people that are in extreme conditions. I though the earbud dongle could have attached itself to the case in a sleeker manner when not in use. Perhaps the extra plug could have a better storage as well. The biggest problem was the echo for those that I was speaking with. Yes, I did blow into the bottom of the case to try to create positive pressure. I couldn't create enough pressure to separate the screen protector from the mic consistently. Besides, really? Come on, you can't honestly expect that having to do this even occasionally would be considered normal. How do you explain to your coworkers that it really isn't the new kazoo app, but that it is a case design flaw?
I purchased this because I have small children who play with my phone. There are a lot of apps for children. I like that the case is slim and not bulky like the otterbox, but has a few small annoyances. You have to completely clean the phone and make sure it is dust free before putting it in the case, otherwise you have small particles inside the case. Also, the area where you plug in the charging cable is hard to plug in and you have to pull out the plug from the cord, weakening the charging cable. You can buy an extender from the lifeproof website, whick works, but is still a little tedious. Over all good though, since I feel that my phone is protected from just about anything.
I bought a lifeproof phone case three weeks ago from Bestbuy The case is expensive for what is . The lifeproof headphone jack covers fell off after using them and screwing them back in...Bestbuy would not supply new ones or give me a new cover. Great customer service by Bestbuy....would never buy from them again. I needed to buy new phone jack covers from Lifeproof who charged me $15.00 for a .05 cent item plus over $9.00 in shipping....big ripoff. Stay away from Lifeproof!!!!! Furthermore, I did research and you can now get your phone waterproofed thru liquipel for $59.00....seems like good new technology.
I wanted to be able to take my iPhone to the beach and on the Mayan cave trek (ATM) in Belize and use it as a camera. I merely wanted to protect it from sand and moisture in these environments. I have no intention of fully submerging the phone, although the empty case passed the leak test with flying colors. It worked fabulously for our Belize vacation and still looks very nice when cleaned up. No sound degradation has been noticed, either input or output. All controls work just fine. I certainly recommend this case for protection from sand, dirt, water encountered in beach, hiking situations. I'm glad I bought it!
The case is very nice and is waterproof. I have had some issues with callers hearing me. The speakers are definitely muffled. Also the headphone jack is painful unless you use the standard apple headphones. My biggest problem is with the screen cover. I've had mine about a week and have several scratches. You cannot add a good screen protector like Zagg. For $70 you'd think this might be covered by warranty. Zagg will send you a free replacement. I contacted Lifeproof and they said NO; not covered and no replacement. This not a 'Lifeproof' case, at least not for the way I live.
Talking is horrible. The sound echoes back to the person you are talking to...badly. If you have no plans on having an actual conversation with someone, then the case is great. I juat feel if I am going to pay this much money for something, then I should at least be able to use my phone for it's primary function, making calls. If you think you will get this and just "tolerate" the echoes, for me, there was no choice. It echoed so bad I had to connect an external headset just to hold a conversation. No, I would not recommend this to a friend.
Works fine as far as being water proof. Talking is horrible. The sounds echoes back to the person I talk to! They can hear themselfs talking!
its started good then it around the ear a hole happened then i drop it and in the corner it rip the rubber .. not worth the money only had it for 2 months ..
This case is perfect! Good quality, great customer service. No product is perfect but LifeProof comes pretty close!! Highly recommend, just buy it!
An expensive case, but the waterproof feature is great. Will not work with any docks because of the way the sync port is covered. Also most sync cords are too big for it. Uses an adaptor for the headphone jack, don't lose or damage it, an expensive replacement. A great case, but lifeproof sure is proud of them.
This case is truly amazing in every category. Not only do you not have to worry about your phone anymore you also aren't bothered with the extra bulk that comes along frequently with other cases. The Lifeproof adds to the phone without adding to the phone. You still have access to all your phone's ports and functions. Lifeproof is a genius was of making the iPhone complete.
Got one today! Just get online and watch the videos before you do anything. If you follow the directions you will have no problem. This thing is awesome!!! I put it to the test and submerged it in the kitchen sink. No problem! Make sure you get online read the manual and watch all the instruction videos before you do anything!!! Wife is getting a purple one. Just paid for it and gonna pick it up tomorrow!!!
I am in law enforcement and a trainer and have to be out in all kinds of weather! No matter what I have to go through at work I don't have to worry if my phone survived! Shock and waterroof! I know its safe! Thanks, Lifeproof for making such a great product! Fergo
While no case is perfect, my LifeProof (I have the black one) is pretty close! I no longer have to worry about the little mishaps (or big ones!) that happen in everyday life as far as my new iPhone 4S is concerned. Oops, I dropped it. Wipe it off, it's fine. Oops, I spilled my drink on it. Rinse it off, it's fine. Oops I accidentally went swimming all day with it (haha). Yep, it's still fine - that's what it was designed to do. I've used a ton of cases and have had all version of iPhones since the original, this case is the only one that has ever lived up to the hype. Even with all of that protection, it is still a lot slimmer than the other cases of this type. I also have the belt clip, which works very well.
My favorite color is black, my iPhone 4 is black, so it only makes sense I own a black LifeProof case. I can't ever imagine owning any other case for my iPhone. I have used other cases & skins but none offer the amount of protection & peace of mind that LifeProof offers.
Ever drop your $600 iPhone in the water by accident? Did is survive? If it was in any normal case (or not at all) it most likely didn't . I did just that--dropped my iPhone 4 in my father-in-law's pond. Didn't even realize it was there until I checked my empty pocket. Was I worried? Not even a bit! It was Lifeproofed! I had my mother-in-law call it. I only found it because I could see it's faint glow beneath the mud. All I did was pick it up and wash the mud off. It worked perfectly and continues to do so to this day. The sound clarity is phenomenal even through the Gortex speaker vents. I've even dropped it a couple of times on the ground--no broken glass! This is the true be-all-end-all case that has set a new standard!
At first I was sceptical about the case but it has already saved me 3 times and not to mention how awesome it is to be able to bring your iPhone in the shower and listen to music. For the type of case that it is it is super slim and light.
The Lifeproof case is the perfect case for everyday use, accidents, and intentional exposure to water, dust, snow, etc. The Lifeproof case is rugged, but very slim with little bulk added to the phone. My Lifeproof case has saved my phone several times already from accidental exposure to water, both at work and home, and has been used to take some great underwater pictures. Lifeproof has great, professional, and dedicated customer service and will take care of any (very few) issues that might arise during your use of their product. I love my Lifeproof case and can't wait until they come out with products to protect my other electronics as well.
I love my LifeProof case! I depend on my iPhone for so much more than "just phone calls." LifeProof makes it better by making it possible to take the iPhone into the water (I like to enjoy my hot tub, knowing that I can still receive a call or text from my kids while I'm in the water), relieving me from the worry that i'll drop my precious phone and lose my "lifeline" and favorite source of entertainment to a fall. I love that I can cook with my phone on the counter and not worry about getting gunk on the iPhone (I can literally WASH it with the LifeProof case on it). The LifeProof case is much more sleek than the Otterbox. The LifeProof case is easy to install.
My never ending search for the perfect case ends here. I've gone through so many cases and money searching for that one case that provides the protection i need for my lifestyle and job description, as an EMS/Firefighter, this case is PERFECT! Mil Spec rating for drops and dust protection as well as the best part of it.......wait for it.......IP-68 rating waterproof protection up to 6.6 feet. It's thin and lightweight and doesn't stick to your pocket, all the buttons and ports are easily accessible without ever taking the case off. I HIGHLY recommend this case and every product they put out, Best customer service and company i have ever dealt with. I honestly can't wait for what this company has in store for us in the future, I'm hooked, LifeProof for life.......Let's Go!
From rainstorms, showers, hot tubs, and puddles to a 6 year olds trip to the potty, this case has protected my beloved phone! Couldn't be happier with this product. Stylish, easy to install and does exactly as advertised.
I would NOT buy this product again. Be aware - only a 30 day warranty standard, case is not designed to be taken on & off, must use Apple-manufactured accessories. Too soon to tell whether the product is any good but the customer experience is awful. For $80 for a piece of plastic, you ought to get decent service. To get their 1 yr warranty, you have to take a test and get 100%. Problem is that if you miss one, it doesn't tell you which one. After multiple tries, finally went back to BB and asked them to help. 3 of them were nice enough to work together on the test & they still couldn't get 100%. Finally figured it out. Filled out the form and got an error message - so still no registration. Tried again (had to take entire test & complete the reg. form again). Same error. Sent email 2 days ago. No response. Tried to call today. Unlike most good tech companies, they keep short west coast hours, can't reach anyone.
I was looking for a case that would protect my iPhone. What I didn't count on was how hard it would make using the phone. After looking around, and willing to pay 80 bucks for a good case, I bought this piece of garbage. I have tried to live with it for about 6 months, and I finally gave up. What I can live with: o The screen protector does not sit directly on the phone screen, so you have to press hard to make contact. o It is a little larger, but for extra protection, I'm OK with that. What I can't live with: o The opening for the charger is too small and too hard to access. Only some charger work. I have three Apple chargers that are too big to fit it. One is in my wife's car, so on road trips I am out of luck. (They advise against taking it out of the case. It is hard to take in and out. Watch the video first.) Then if charging cord does fit in, you must yank it out, because you cannot reach in to squeeze the sides. I have already wrecked one charging cord. o In order to listen to music, you first have to unscrew a cap and then screw in a special adapter that is about 4 inches long with a plug on the other end for the aux cord. If you get a call, you have to unscrew the special adapter before you can speak. Very awkward. Oh, and don't loose the little screw cap, without it, you loose the waterproof aspect. Oh and as for the waterproof, if you really need it, then that would be the only reason to get this case. If you really want one, I will sell this one cheap!
so i've had this case for about a month and so far i love it. i have no problem with the touch screen or the speakers. the only problem i have, which is beyond frustrating, is when i try and go for a run/workout. my headphones won't fit the port and the adapter that comes with the phone is pathetic (or at least mine is). the connection is horrible b/t the adapter and my headphones. it sounds like a scratchy record and i'll loose sound through one of my ear buds... Does anyone have any suggestions to fix this? i've tries taping the two together... any help would be appreciated... thanks.
This is a great case that had perfect response. I have dropped it many times and little problems. If you want the most out of this product go to their website and watch their videos. I did and they will have all the proper care. I never think twice if the case can protect my iPhone 4S.
Sooo since I didn't upgrade at BestBuy and don't have insurance on my phone this was a must!! Love love love the case! I've had it since Best Buy has been selling them so I have the black! I would typically change out my cases often and have three bright girly speck cases in my dresser drawer that I haven't touched for months! Just get it already if you are on the fence about it, it's worth it!
DOES NOT provide protection against dropping. My wife's phone dropped out of her pocket onto the garage floor and the Iphone screen cracked just as easily as when it was not in any case. Save your money and use it to pay for a new screen, you'll come out ahead.
So far the phone as taken a couple of spills and the case seems to be doing it's job.
Case works! BUT no costomer service.. Phone number is worthless no answer,same for twitter account! Bought second gen for 4s people I call have hard time hearing me! Siri can't understand! Because of design of case I can't use docking station and the company has a dock extender but it's been out of stock for months!! Again worst part is lifeproof doesn't answer any calls,inquires or twitter posts! Sure it works to keep water out but it's worthless once your $400 phone is in it!! Horrible customer service! Don't make the same mistake I did and buy this!!!
I was like you, scrolling thru reviews, trying to decide if I wanted to fork out so much money for a phone case. I read some of these reviews and almost let it sway me from buying. Luckily I took a friends advise and took the plunge. Man, I am glad I did. This case is just like the phone it protects, light years ahead of the competition. I highly recommend you visit the LifeProof website before use to watch detailed instructions on how to install the case on phone. I followed the tutorial and had no problems. I can't even tell the phone has a cover on it. Functions work perfect and the screen is crystal clear and very responsive. The sound is muffled a few decibels but you can open the charging port, play with equalizer settings and lay the phone face down to help with song play. The back cover acts like a giant speaker (genius). I will gladly trade a few decibels for peace of mind any day. I use mine everyday to protect from rain, snow, mud, dirt, dust, scratches and anything else that goes along with a construction site. I can't wait to return to my favorite theme parks so I can finally get some great pictures and videos of the water rides. We have always taken plastic bags along to stuff cameras and cell phones in to protect them from the water. Not any more. I am already on the waiting list for the iPad version of this case. Can't wait! Thanks, LifeProof, for peace of mind. "LET'S GO!"
I bought this case when Best Buy first started carrying them after my Otterbox had gotten kind of oldish. I absolutely loved it at first and then started running into some problems leading me to go back to another otterbox. I love the screen and the thinness of the case. I happen to use a bose docking station at home and you cannot just plug this phone in. You have to get an extender that Best Buy does NOT sell. So I hit up a well known auction site and the waiting game started. I also happen to work in an office setting that blocks everything known to man on the internet. So I listen to my Pandora on my phone most of the day. Not a bad thing except that you have to figure that I was taking the extender in and out of the case daily. Then comes the little screw-in plugs at the top. They are extremely fragile after a month or so. I ended up going through the 2 that came with the case in less than 3 months. Not too big of a deal except Best Buy does not carry replacements and Lifeproof is out online most of the time. I ended up being stuck with a case that was no longer waterproof and overpriced. I ended up going back to the otterbox and my life of carrying around an extender and auxiliary cord are done.
In spite of some of the negative reviews that I have read, I have found this case to perform EXACTLY as promised. I have found no minor problems with it, let alone any major problems. Each of my chargers, including the one in my car, work perfectly; the touch screen works just as well as my iPhone 4S worked without the case; the fingerprints on the screen are no worse than the screen of the 4S; each of the buttons on the case work just the same as they did on the 4S itself. I would not hesitate to recommend this case for these reasons as well as for the excellent protection it offers to my 4S.
Excellent case. Just as advertised. Used iPhone to play radio while dry walling. Just rinsed it off afterwards. Looks good as new.
The Life Proof case has saved my iPhone 4S on more than one occasion. The product is as described. I do not know why others have had less than positive experiences with the case, as I have found no drawbacks as of yet.
The only two issues that people have complained about, audio problems and touch screen sensitivity, are NOT problems at all in my experience. I use my iPhone constantly all day for business. Not one person has complained about audio quality, and I have asked everyone. Touch screen sensitivity is just as good as it is with nothing over the screen. Now add the full protection against water, snow, dirt and shock and you have a winner! I have used it in the shower and pool! can't wait to go skiing! On top of all this, it's thin enough to still fit in your pant pocket! Perfect! Of course, the price is a little high, but now that I have used it, I would buy it again.
In making this case as protective as they have, there are a few awkward things that get dragged along. For example: some third-party car chargers don't fit in the hole designed to be for the Apple charge cord. For example: earphones cannot plug directly into the phone--they must plug into the somewhat unwieldy adapter that must be screwed in (to keep the water-tight quality, I would guess.). For example: each of the physical dimensions of the phone is noticeably larger than with the phone by itself. However, the main purpose is protection, and this is done well. While I have not submerged my phone as the store clerk did, I have dropped it, with no ill effects. There has been little noticeable loss of sensitivity to using the touch features of the phone, for dialing and for apps. And there are some nice touches. For example: the plug that covers the earphone hole could be easily lost, but there is a place included on the earphone adapter to firmly hold it. If a friend needed maximum protection for his phone, I would steer him to this product. In spite of the awkwardness, I still use it. But it is not perfect.
I learned about Lifeproof and thought it would be a great product. After reading reviews I became hesitant spending the money for it. I was planning on going skiing so I decided to give it a shot. I have to say that I am more than impressed. I'm so impressed that I use it everyday instead of just for skiing. The case fits perfect on an Iphone4S and I don't have any issues with sound, space, or talking on the phone. I do agree that the case "seems" cheap once you hold it without your phone inside. Once I got it on I completely changed my mind. If I could change anything on this product it would be the back casing. Within 1 or 2 minutes after putting the case on my phone I dropped it twice! It is just a little slippery.
I am extremely disappointed in this case. For $80, it should be a very easy to use and well thought out design. It is not. 1. The only charging cable you can use with this case is the one provided by apple. No other off brand cables will fit through the docking port. The only car charger I have found to work with this case is one that has a usb port. You can plug the usb from the apple charging cable into it. This also means if you have a docking station on your radio, alarm clock or other device, you will not be able to use it without taking the phone out of the case. You might think, well easy enough, stop being lazy, just take it out of the case, then put it back in. Well, that brings us to the next problem. 2. It is very difficult to remove the phone from the case. It also damages the case slightly each time you take the phone out. With this in mind, unless you want the waterproof seal damaged within a couple of weeks, it is not feasible to take the phone out of the case to charge or dock it. 3. For those of you that like to listen to music through your iphone, you will need special headphone adapters. You need a longer plug than what comes on most headphones in order for it to fit though the case. 4. Sound quality is not great through this case, and the screen protector is terrible. It makes the screen much less sensitive. 5. This case has also caused me many issues because it makes it very easy to turn the ringer completely off on your phone. A slight bump to the side button will cause you to turn the ringer off. It is not this easy if not in the case. 6. There are much better products out there for the price. It does do a good job of protecting the phone from drops and screen scratches, but so would a $30 case and a screen protector. Is it waterproof? Maybe. I did the water test and there was condensation on the inside of the case. This makes me very leary of putting my phone in the water. I does protect it from the rain, but I would not submerge it. The case specifically says, the company takes no reponsibility if your phone is damaged while in this case. A better product is the H2O sports case and headphones if you like to take you music swimming . I did end up purchasing these and so far have been swimming with them 4 hours per week since Christmas and they are wonderful. The H2O Sports brand does a quality assurance test on every individual product before shipping. This makes me much more confident. **I will be buying a different case for everyday use. Missing a call while being on call is not an option.***
I can't believe that it's waterproof still but it really is. Just be careful of the small attachment that you need to screw into the headphone jack because it's a very small piece that's easy to drop and lose. So if you remove it, don't remove it someplace where u will lose it if u drop it. It's actually more slender than the otterbox case. And it fits in my pocket. Even though it's fully enclosed, the speakers are still great. Not sure of the longevity yet. A negative is that it doesn't fit on all chargers but does fit on all of the white charger cables from apple.
I went swimming today with my iPhone in its Lifeproof case. Plus I actually was listening to music on the phone while I was sitting on the bottom of the pool. And 6 hours later I am writing this review. Lifeproof does what it promises it will do. Worth the money. Buy it!
I bought this for my 12 year old son to protect his Iphone. It works great. At first, I didn't want to spend so much for the case but it is well worth the money. He has dropped his phone numerous times & his phone wasn't harmed. We haven't put it in water but I am confident it will still work,
I have left my iPhone 4S under a bowl of water for more than 30min with no issues. I recommend this item as it facilitate takin pictures and videos under the rain, swimming pool, snowing day, etc...You can even answer a call while taking a shower.
This case does do exactly what it says and very well, at a cost both in use and price tag. When I got home I dropped it on the ground and dipped it in my pool and the phone is fine, in mint condition in the case. After 2 weeks of use I have found a lot of flaws that will keep me from buying it again, not all will of these affect everybody: The screen is touchier then you are used to with the built in screen protector. After a couple weeks of use, you get used to it. It adds a lot of bulk so it would not fit into my marine radio that was designed for the iPhone. Plugging it in to charge takes some practice. Sounds are muffled and even worse, people I talk to are getting horrible echo to where they could not talk to me on the phone. This was the last straw and why I can't use it. After all, phone quality is already a big issue on most smartphones. I also noticed that from taking the phone out of the case and back (approximately 10-12 times) that one of the seals near the mouthpiece had broken away. It looks like it was a sealant. IMHO, this phone has one type of person it is designed for; someone whose phone might get wet on a regular basis, otherwise for typical average everyday use, the cons outweigh the pros. This came highly recommended from the salesperson so don't be fooled.
This is a great case, water proof and shock proof. Meets mil spec. Out of all the rugged cases out there this is by far one of the best. The selling point for me was it is the least bulkiest. My phone stays in my pocket and my job calls for a rugged case. Sound is not greatly diminished as some people say (and I have bad hearing), all buttons are fully usable and though the screen protector is plastic it does the job. Reflection (to me) is not bad but you can place a anti glare screen film over it for an added layer if it bothers you. Other people complain about 3rd party head phones and chargers not fitting, they don't, it wasn't made with that in mind. Your standard iPhone headphones fit perfect and it comes with an adapter for 3rd party sets. My biggest gripe is the screen protector. For the high price you'd expext gorilla glass. Overall great rugged case for pockets.
Make sure to watch the installation first and before you leave the store, ya I know it's just a case but you will wish you had if you really want to protect your investment. Additionally make sure to open the package and inspect the microphone befalls inside the case for damage. This is the most sensitive part of the case and if you take your phone in and out a lot they can become damaged. The only thing I am not satisfied about is that if you want to attach anything but the original factory USB cord you need an adapter.
Ok, I'll start off by saying I have an iPhone 4 and when I first got it, I also got the Vapor Element case (1st Generation). I had A LOT of disappointments - after market chargers and headphones did not fit. I had to search the web for solutions which included getting charger adapters or shaving/filing the plastic casings on chargers and headphones so when I got the lifeproof case, I was already prepared somewhat. I have tossed the lifeproof case on carpet, tile, and hardwood floors and it did protect the phone (fully functional). It did scuff/scratch the case but phone was fine. My 6 and 10 year old kids have submerged it completely in the tub, sink, and fish tank at least six times and it did remain waterproof as advertised. Now I didn't take it out and put it back into the case more than 4 times so far so I couldn't attest to what some users say about it failing after a number of tries. I normally use the Bluetooth both for calls and working out so the headphone issue was not an issue except when I'm driving (use a cassette adaptor on 1 car and aux adaptor on another car. All I had to do was cut off a small part of the plastic casing at the end of the headphone jack so it will fit without having to screw in the adaptor that comes with the case (or have to buy an extra one from them, which is irritating). So if you are concerned with not being able to use after market headphones (only the Apple headphone jack fits, and I will not spend that money to purchase more Apple stuff), a little cutting will make it work. I'm a little concerned that lifeproof sells o-rings so I'm not sure on how long they are expected to last but the did indicate that the case is not meant to be removed and put back too often...
Expensive. Muffled sound from speakers. Makes you sound muffled to other people you call. Less response from touch screen. Screen protector makes the screen dimmer and a different shade. It is waterproof and dust proof. Great for a trip to the beach but not for every day use.
I travel all the time for personal and business and this case has now exceeded all of my expectations. In the restroom, in the plane, outdoors; in the rain, the wind and even with food. Every scenario in which the case as come in contact with dirt, liquid, shock, etc., it has protected the phone. The sound is great, the camera works great and you don't have to remove it to sync it using the non-fastening version of the syncing cable. If you use the fastening version, then you will have to remove the case to get the cable unfastened.
This is a great case for your iPhone, it's basically everything proof. I will say that you should make sure you have the phone really clean before you put it in the case because it's a pain to get in and out. Won't fit on any docks in the case, so that's why I rated it only 4 stars, otherwise it's a small investment to protect your iPhone! All the buttons work perfectly and the front screen cover doesn't really make the screen much less sensitive. I know 5 people with this exact case and they all love it.
Truly an amazing case. Works underwater, works in the desert, works in the ice and snow! Great when you have 2 and 4 year old girls that love water! I have taken photos underwater with this case to protect my iPhone 4S and the photos are awesome. It is also great when you are dealing with the wonderful Chicago weather conditions, doesn't prevent any sound clarity even in the wind and rain. The only issue I have had with it to date is the only plug you can use is the apple factory default. All other products you can buy for charging the iPhone with this case on do not fit. I have tried Rocketfish, Belkin, Griffin, Duracell, and a few others, none will fit as the adapter width must be thin like the one that came with the iPhone.
Wanted the best protection I could get, and that wouldn't make my iphone any larger than it already is. This fit the bill. Attractive, functional, slim,durable.
This is an exceptional, (so far) waterproof case for the iPhone 4s. My family has three such cases and they all function as advertised. We did notice one drawback, the case won't couple with my wife's car connection that would allow music to be played through the car's stereo.
Puchased this for my husband because he always complained about his OtterBox Defender cover for his iPhone 4. He said it was too bulky and wouldn't fit into a pocket easily. The LifeProof cover slides easily and still offers excellent protection. Our kittie knocked over a soda recently and it spilled all over his iPhone. Not a problem...the LifeProof protected as advertised against water spillage. Best money I have ever spent...no more complaints from my husband. Ahhhh....peace! The only reason it received four stars instead of five is the pricepoint. Ouch!
Really is waterproof, as I learned, and the case is slim which is a good alternative to the otterbox bulky case.
The Lifeproof case for iPhone 4/4S does what it says. Waterproof, shockproof, etc. the only con I have is a nasty echoing the other person on the phone can hear. If your an avid phone-talker, this case isn't for you. If you don't so much use your iPhone for talk too much, I'd recommend this case.
This case is absolutely a piece of garbage!! I had bought this case with my new iPhone 4s thinking that it would offer the best protection for my iPhone. I was severely mistaken. Sure it was waterproof but it took a 12inch fall onto a tile floor and the side of the case split open and the silent switch rocker broke completely. After superglueing my $80 case back together I had managed to waterproof it enough for my skiing trip. Glad I didn't go swimming. I emailed the company since they were supposed to have already sent me a replacement front to fix a light sensor problem with the iPhone 4s, and I got nowhere with the company for almost 2 months. They finally mailed my new case 2 days ago and when I got it today they had sent me the wrong part and a packing slip saying the box should've had the right part in it. If you're looking for good protection for your iPhone I would recommend the Otterbox Defender (the case I have now) or the Ballistic Hardcore case that my EMT brother has. Both of those are half the price and far superior to the Lifeproof junk.
I bought the lifeproof case only to find out it is the belt clip only. The advertising shows the phone case along with the belt clip, shady marketing, I get it home thinking things are missing, and read the box carefully and it says in thin yellow lettering towards the bottom of the box Requires iphone case to use.
Case is descent, it keeps water and everything else out. The screen cover almost always sticks to the screen creating that ugly suction spot that you would typically get from air pocket bubbles. The sound is muzzled. If you have a vehicle phone charger, do not purchase this case! None of them fit....
Have had this case since December. A lot of people complain about head phones and chargers. I have had no problems. I use a inocase car charger. Fits perfect. And I also use Bluetooth headset. Never have to worry about taking the plug out. Invest in Bluetooth and have no worries.
I received this as a Christmas present and liked the idea of it being waterproof as I'm very careful when it rains or snows that my phone doesn't get at all wet. However, after using it for one afternoon I realized when I made phone calls the person on the other end could barely hear me after they kept complaining. I called my line from another phone while my boyfriend was on my phone and I couldn't believe how hard it was to hear him. I looked on a few websites and found this is a common problem and a few "fixes" to improve it. I tried these "fixes" and none improved the call quality at all. The other thing I noticed is it is hard to text or write an email. It turns your touchscreen into a "push screen" as you really have to apply pressure for the phone to recognize what you are doing. This is very annoying and time consuming. This was returned after using it for only 8 hours or so.
I have only had this case about 4 weeks but I think the phone works very well inside the case- I have had no issues with the touch screen or other functionality. I have not gotten the phone totally wet but it is nice not to have to worry if it is raining or if something get splashed on the phone.
I just came back from a two week vacation in Hawaii and every time I went for a run it rained. Now I can honestly say I have finally found a product that does not make me interrupt my run or ziploc my phone while listening to music and using my running apps. While there, I was also able to enjoy hiking, kayaking, going to the beach, all while taking pictures and using my phone as needed. Although in socal it doesn't rain as much, at least now I have the peace of mind that my phone is protected in case (insert word) hits the fan. The only drawback is the inability to dock it or use any charger other than the standard iPhone cord. The lifeproof website a of today is out of stock from their charging adapters, so no 5 stars for that. If you are not into outdoors or sports, then this is not for you, maybe stick to the otter box instead.
A personal fact about me, I love music. Which is why I got an iPhone (iPod + phone, perfect). This case however, was not designed with those kinds of people in mind. I can live with removing that little knob on the top intended to vacuum seal the device to put my headphones in. However the hole made in the top of the case won't allow that. Instead they provide an adapter that screws in to connect headphones. Now personally, I can live with taking calls via earbuds, but just say I get a call for someone else (someone who hates earbuds)...SOL there. It makes things really inconvenient. The second I realized my headphones would be essentially screwed into the case was the minute I decided to return it. And no, disconnecting the headphones from the adapter won't return the device to normal. The adapter will be read as headphones wether or not they are attached. While the earbud matter was my fatal flaw, there are some other problems (ones I could live with).... -very sticky buttons. They require a significant amount of pressure to use at all. -essentially unprotected front. I like cases that have something around the Home button. Just makes me feel more confident that if it lands face down, I'm good (let's face it, if you drop your phone, chances are it will land face up or down. Better safe than sorry). The whole front of the device is essentially exposed. That's my 2 cents on this. I'm a college student studying computer science in PA. I use my phone a lot. But my phone doesn't go through hurricane winds, flash floods, or earthquakes. We get snow, but put your phone in a pocket of a good coat and consider it snow proofed. So if your a person who wants a protective case for general use, don't go with this. Otter does some respectable work, try those. Not water proof but suits the needs of a typical user better.
The vibration of the front cover causes an echo. The person you're talking to hears his/her voice double every time they call. Also, DO NOT REMOVE IT FROM THE CASE MORE THAN 2 TIMES, IT WILL BREAK on the inside. It's too expensive for the quality it really has. Don't buy it on ebay because the warranty won't apply to them...Customer services is very good
I have been very disappointed with this case. The screen cover gets very foggy and does not clean easily. The standard charger will not fit into the phone w the case on. You have to purchase the charger with a slimmer profile. It is not compatable with any accessories that play the device in a docking station. It is very difficult to get the case on and off so realistically I can no longer enjoy my iPhone as a music source at home or in my car. The structure of the case makes it much more difficult to type, adjust the volume/sound as well as the power button. I would not recommend this case if you dock your phone for any reason or if you don't want to replace all of your chargers/connectors.
This is a great case .I got it a few days ago it works great . The water proof feature is awesome . I have video taped under water and watched Netflix in the shower. No problems with the talking quality . Over all the case is great for every one. Great for outdoors and for under water video.
The quality of this case is junk, once your phone is enclosed or "protected", it breaks. Also you have to spend an extra twnety dollars for an adapter if you want to use your iphone on a docking station, a car charger, or a good FM transmitter. the headset adapter is also lacking in quality. JUNK!
At first I was extremely excited to get this case; I always fear something happening to my iPhone 4S. Life Proof said that it protected against water, snow, dust and shock. The first three all seem very reasonable, but shock: not really. The case, although light, is made from very cheap plastic. The screen protector built in is very clear, but it started to have these oily-type rainbow streaks/bubbles. This is why I have never like screen protectors: bubbling/quality. I am very disappointed that after only two days I have to return it because the screen shows streaks/bubbles.
After reading some reviews I was kind of concerned about getting this case. However I needed a durable case that was water proof etc. This case was the answer. I had the otter box for my other iPhone and you think with the name otter it would be water proof or at least resistant well guess what its not. After spending a day in the rain at a containment scene the phone was soaked and lost. I got the iPhone 4s and this case. The phone already has spent the day in the rain and a fall in the lake when I took it with me on my waverunner and the phone is completely intact. The headphone adapter is made so the phone can remain water proof, I have sony all weather earphone and they work great with the adapter. So if you are military, police, fire or just plan active this is the right case for you.
Case does exactly what it says it does. Its waterproof, dust proof, and its slimmer than an otterbox. Only downside to this case is that an adapter is required to use headphone jack or if you want to dock it. Salesman let me know this when I bought it so this was no surprise.
I wish someone would have steered me away from this huge waste of money. Needless to say, it broke pretty fast upon receiving it. The worst part is that there is absolutely no customer service. Nobody ever answers their customer service phone line, and some of the lines are even disconnected. Emails bounce back and forth with little resolution. However, they seem to respond to Facebook posts (whatever that is worth, horrible business plan). Shame on Best Buy for offering this product without investigating the company first. I had to file with American Express to get a response and my $ back.
Lifeproof customer service is horrendous been trying to get into contact with then for almost a week regarding a warranty issue with no reply. If you buy this product expect no kind of warranty support.
This case is amazing! I take underwater videos of my kids in the pool and at the beach, I've dropped it several times and had my iPhone completely survive, and it looks great! I refused to get an Otterbox because of how bulky they are and how "sticky" the rubber on their cases is, instead the Lifeproof is thin, sleek, and not sticky at all. I will say that some of the reviews on here are disappointing because they talk about how they had poor sound quality, or how you need to use an apple charger with the case, or how you need to use an adapter to use headphones. I'm disappointed because whoever had a case with poor sound quality said they're just going to return the case and be done with it. I too had a case with poor sound quality and when I reached out to Lifeproof about it, they sent me a new front for the case and that completely cleared up the sound issues! That person returned the greatest case ever without even trying to see if there was a fix. Yes, you use an adapter for headphones, I find no issue with that. Yes, you need to use an Apple charger or a knock-off charger that is the same size or the charger won't fit into the case, but isn't that worth the security to know that your phone is protected? I can't say enough how happy I am with this case. I've had 8 friends/family members buy it after I showed off it's abilities and I will continue to recommend it to everyone I can. Not only is it a quality product, but the company stands behind it to fix any issues and make sure you are satisfied. That's hard to find these days...
Definitely a durable and slim case. Very good. Unfortunately, I will be returning it due to it's inability to fit most standard headphone jacks. I have the Bose MIE2i headphones, and they will not fit. The case comes with an adapter, but you must screw it in each time to use it. Also, the slightest movement may make you lose sound in one or both ear buds at times. TL;DR: Good for protection, bad if you plan on using headphones.
This has to be the best case I have seen so far for the iPhone. I am pretty rough on my phone at times. This case has stood up to the punishment with no damage to my phone.
My son has damaged several phones. He has cracked a screen and jumped in the pool with one. After spending this much on a phone I wanted to make sure that it did not get damaged.
When I first got this case, I couldn't believe how slim and sleek it was, and yet the protection it boasts is seemingly bulletproof. This was my first iPhone, so I played around with it for quite some time, downloading new Apps, browsing the web, etc. For this purpose, the case excels. The screen is somewhat interfering, though certainly not the worst I've tried. When I finally decided to make some calls, everyone kept telling me they were having a hard time hearing me. There seems to be some sort of static on the other end, along with my voice being dampened by the case. Since I don't feel like yelling on all phone calls (and thanks to Best Buy's 30-day warranty), I will be bringing this case back to the store.
I had an Otterbox for the past year on my iPhone 4, and was very impressed as it saved my phone from utter annihilation on multiple occasions, including about five times when it fell over 30 feet onto asphalt. I hated how the rubber cover would always peel off when removing the device from my pocket and hadn't heard of the Lifeproof case until a family member told me about them. Went out and bought mine that day, was amazed at its waterproof abilities (which have become a party trick of sorts) and its durability. The most incredible case I've ever seen / heard of / used. HIGHLY recommended for people like me who are notoriously hard on phones.
LifeProof is a new company marketing an innovative and highly functional ultra protective case for iPhone 4/4S. If their iPhone 4/4S case is any indication of what the iPad 2 case is going to be like LOOKOUT. LifeProof case for 4/4S gives you protection where and when you need it from all of the elements without adding significant bulk to your device 1.5mm to be exact. plus the company offers a plethora of accessories to satisfy every adventurous need. If this first offering from LifeProof functions this well, I cant wait to see what they make next! The bottom line is you will spend at least 80-100 dollars on screen protectors and other inferior cases and only end up wishing you would have bought a LifeProof case first.
I never write reviews, but after seeing a few bad ones for this product I figured I would give mine. From what I've read here are the cons about this case: bad audio (speakerphone & regular mode), bad touchscreen response, bad audio on other end of call and bad glare when outside. Also people complained about the charging port just big enough for standard apple chargers. All of these couldn't be more wrong. The audio is fine from all aspects, the glare is no different than the phone without the case or any invisishield and the touchscreen response though noticable is no problem for my fingers. The piece of mind is worth the price tag. Already tried it in shower, no problemo. $70 for a case that protects a $600 phone. Worth it.
This is the perfect case for my 4s. It is water proof as I've tested. If you follow the online instructions you will have the best results. You can get rid of the air pockets if you follow the video. It is so strong for its thickness. If your thinking about spending that $80, don't its well worth the money. Why not pay $80 on a case instead of $15 a month protection plan?(Verizon)
Bought this case after much debate with myself. Due to what seemed to be a high price. I've been using it for about a month now and I really like it. Easily in and out of the pocket, I've dropped several times, took video under water. Anyway I have no trouble with any echo sounds when I talk to other people not on my end or theirs.
I was excited about this case. I followed the instructions on testing the product in the sink for an hour, cleaning the iPhone4 (i even used compressed air). I took swimming in ocean to take pics while on swim. Worked great the first 2 times. Was able to text the picture to a friend even. 3rd time I swam - the touch sensitivity wasn't working and I couldn't unlock phone. I swam in. Phone said missing SIM card - I opened case and water poured out and phone went DEAD. $150 to replace at APPLE. DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!
This is a solid case with great protection from the elements. If your main concern is protection, or the ability to take your phone into water then this is the case for you. The problem I have with it is accesibility for everyday use. My Skull Candy earphones jack will not fit in the port so I have to use the supplied adaptor. This screws into the headphone port and adds about 5 inches to your cord. If you remove the headphones from the adapdor, you don't get sound from the phone. You have to unscrew the adaptor before you get sound and you'll have to screw in another plug if you want to maintain water integrity. You can use Apple headphones without the adaptor if you like. The other problem is the bottom port that will not allow for anything other than an apple sync cable and even that can be a struggle at times to get in. I cannot use my car charger nor my stereo adaptor with this case. It is not a simple thing to take this case off. Also, the screen cover fits loosely and can make hitting the correct letter while texting difficult. This is an expensive case that I will use if I am going for a swim, or biking in the rain, but when you pay about $80 for a case you expect to be able to use it easily at all times.
I have to say that I did not buy this case to go underwater or do any crazy things. Getting out of the car I dropped my 3gs and shattered the screen. So I hoped to get a case that could protect me from this disaster with my new 4s. The case looks good and is light weight. My wife and I both received our 4s phones and we both bought lifeproof cases. She told me when I called her at work using the new phone and case that I sounded like I was talking in a coffee can. After that I had her call me at home using her new phone and case and she sounded the same way. I took the case off and the sound returned to normal. So the clarity of calls is diminished with this case. Also, if you have a car charger do not expect to use it. Both of mine did not fit and any after market chargers in my house did not fit either. Those are some things to consider when buying this case.
I have had both cases on my iPhone 4s and have seen both in action. People can complain about Life Proof not being worth the $80 all they want, but they are just cheap people looking for a cheap case. If all you are worried about is dropping your phone, then otterbox is the way to go, as long as you do not mind carrying a brick in your pocket. Life Proof has room for improvements of course, but is by far the better case. Watch some videos about Life Proof on the internet and the torture tests people put them through and notice how you will never see people doing half the things they do with an otterbox case on their phone. Yes, nothing lasts forever and there is room for improvement, but come on people. Hands down Life Proof wins this battle.
Love the case, ordered a few of them. Customer service is THE WORST of any company i have done business with in years.
I bought this case after seeing youtube videos of what it could do. Tested it myself in water and yes it is completely waterproof. The $80 for the case is a bit steep but is worth it. The case has a small gap between the back of the iPhone and it to resonate the sound, and it works incredibly well. NO you cannot use the touchscreen underwater, though this has nothing do with the actual case. If you do need to contact customer support, you need to remember that the company is still very small, they will respond just give them time. I highly urge people looking for a rugged case to get this one, remember that the case is $80 is a lot cheaper than $600!
I am writing to let everyone know about my experience with the Lifeproof case. I bought the case 2 weeks ago for the 4gs. This company has a great idea with the "4 proofs," but the actual performance is fair. I followed all the instructions for the warranty and did the leak test. To my surprise, it actually worked. The case was bone dry. After doing the test and reading more through the company website, I realized that the auto brightness feature will not work with the 4gs and that the company will send a new front plate for the case. A simple form to fill out, but will take weeks to arrive. After installing the case on my phone, I really noticed that it is very light and feels cheap. I do not believe this case is shock proof. It is no where nearly as protective as the OtterBox, but is a lot smaller and less bulky. My major problem is the echo that the person on the other end hears. It is almost unbearable to most of the people I talk to. I went to the internet again, and Lifeproof is aware of the issue. They explain that it is because of a difference in pressure to the outside of the phone. Their remedy is to blow into the microphone. A simple fix, that does not work. I expect no problems out of a $70 case. I called Lifeproof customer service and they never returned my call. I will be returning this case back to BB for an exchange to the OtterBox
I just got my lifeproof 2 days ago so the verdict is still out on some things but I thought I would share my immediate opinion. I bought it because my Otterbox was destroyed and the Otterbox was so bulky I was looking for something less bulky but also I wanted something that would protect my phone. So far so good except for one thing. my charger that came with my phone does not work in it. It won;t go in but the charger I got with my ipod does work. I think the ipod charger is a little less bulky.I have 4 chargers because I like keeping one on my bedside table for at night, another one in my office and another one in my laptop case so I always have a charger no matter where I go. Out of these only one works. The car charger also works but those 2 is it. That is aggravating. They need to make it so all the chargers meant to be used with the iphone work with it. This is the reason I only gave it a 4 instead of 5 stars. Suzanne
I am yet another one of the many that got suckered by the marketing of this product. A slim, waterproof, shockproof case? Awesome right? Not so much. After living with the case for 2 weeks it is going back for a refund and being replaced with an Otterbox. I'm glad I purchased from Best Buy because those that bought direct are having horror stories trying to return their case for a refund. The concept is great, but the case just isn't finished well. It seems like they rushed it to market, and now they are having to backtrack and fix the flaws. The case is waterproof at first, but it seems like it won't stay that way. I personally met two people who fried their phones showing just how "water proof" their couple month old cases were. I'm not going to wait around for that to happen for the $80 I paid. There are several problems with this case. The screen is highly reflective, so you can't see it in direct sunlight. Additionally, there is a space between the screen protector and the phone that doesn't go away with time. It makes the phone screen much less touch responsive, and where the screen and protector did touch, there were rainbow, oil-stain like marks. The phone is also very muffled when in the case. Oh, and none of your aftermarket accessories, headphones, and chargers will work with this case unless you spend another $35+ on adapters. Basically if you do a little research on this case, ALL of the reviews say the same thing. The widely positive reviews out there all seem like they are coming from the manufacturer themselves, or from people who were given free cases. Very disappointed with this purchase. If I had paid $35 for the case, I would probably hang onto it, but for $80 it is a ripoff, especially since it doesn't even come with a belt clip. Oh, and it is NOT compatible with the iPhone 4S. Lifeproof have said they are fixing the issue, but the updated cases will be available ??? No thanks!!!
This is literally the best case you can buy. It is amazing. I love it. The screen cover is protective, without feeling like there is anything there. The case is not nearly as thick as most other cases, and is just as effective at keeping the phone safe from drops. I've put it in a glass of ice water, and it's totally fine. It also can be washed off if you get it anything on it! It is really worth the money.
Just got this. brought back an open box b/c it had some scratches on the screen. Not great at sunset. Glare is really bad. Screen bubbles a bit making quick texting a bit getting used to. But he's the facts. I work outdoors rain or shine. Heights, sand, snow, and worst of all conditions, I have 3 kids that love my phone. I wish the body was tackier so it wont slide, but all in all, youll be laughing when u can use your phone during that next hurricane, raining ball game or what ever u do. Small sacrifices for such a safe case. I like it. dont love it cause it's over priced. Just dont lose your phone. I use bluetooth so i dont know what the deal is with feedback or echoes but i noticed at full volume, sound gets caught in the phone which could be the source but only proves it's locked tight.
I have had several iPhone cases to include the OB Defender and the Griffin. The OB broke into several pieces when dropped and the plastic screen protector basically fell apart not to mention you could never get it out of your pocket and the outer skin constantly peeled back and was lose. The Griffin was great but same problem with the rubber and difficulty getting it out of your pocket not to mention its like carrying a small tank in your pocket and neither of these were waterproof. Pros: Now for the LifeProof, overall a great case if your concerned about water and shock. You cannot beat it and there is nothing like it on the market as of Oct 2011. I am constantly dropping it in water just to show it off and get some laughs. The outer skin and plastic are superb and it does not stick in your pocket at all. It has some rubber grip feel to it in between the plastic and back which gives great grip when holding it but avoids getting hung up in the pocket somehow. It is very durable plastic not cheap like the Otterbox and the screen protector seems to be somewhat scratch resistant. I doubt much will harm your phone while in this level of protection unless something hits the screen directly hard enough to break the glass. The size is amazingly small for the level of protection you get. It is about the size of a normal iPhone Otterbox case with one level of protection! Not much larger than the phone itself just a tad bit longer, really insane when you think about it. Cons: There is a pretty big gap between the screen protector and the glass so when you are typing or trying to click on something you have about 1/16th of an inch play in the screen protector and glass which is very sloppy. I tried sucking the air our but no dice the screen plastic is just not snug enough to the glass and needs to be more form fitted. The screen protector is very high gloss and has constant glare. It also is the worst I have seen for picking up grease and fingerprints and difficult to remove without a solution. If you plan on using speaker phone forget it! The sound coming out of the phone to include your ringer is now reduced by 30% if not more. There is even a vibration when it rings or plays music. When you are listening to a call the sound is muffled quite a bit. I used it with the volume up all the time but kept missing calls so I had to switch to an irritating ring tone just to hear it. The trap door at the bottom which covers the charger port does not open wide enough to fit anything other than a standard apple charge cable. This is a problem if you use the larger 2.5v griffin cord for fast charging like I do but not a show stopper just not well thought out. It will break in time for sure. Overall: I deal allot with waterproof camera housings for underwater photography and this is basically what this was built around same principal with the o-rings. However you are a complete knucklehead if you plan on taking a $650 iPhone snorkeling or diving in this case protected by an o-ring! One hair in the seal and your done. There are other devices for that lol not to mention you cant take calls underwater.....or can you? As for the cost, no way in h*** this thing is worth $80 dollars! You are simply paying for someone else's creation and that's it. It's not titanium but apparently LifeProof thinks it is with that price. If you're in need of protection from the elements and are around water etc then this is for you. If you're an office jockey then there is no need. I was going to purchase a few more for my kids phones but will hold off now until the company decides to respond to my emails about the iPad case. They also expect you to buy the ipad case by preorder with only one small image of the product on their site. I also want to continue testing this out before I invest in a few more. Although its worth what you pay the first time it hits the water it has far to many cons vs pros so thumbs down on this until the price drops and they fix the few issues. The sound is the biggest deal breaker for me. Life Proof should try and return emails instead of sending out advertisements and junk email I never signed up for.
After reading several positive reviews of this product, I decided to purchase one for my new 4S. It really is a fantastic concept, and I was excited to find a product that addressed all of the protective qualities I want in a case. During phone conversations, I started receiving a lot of complaints of an "echo" or "feedback" that the person I was speaking with was able to hear, but that I couldn't hear at all on my end. The feedback was present when I was speaking directly into the handset and through the speakerphone function, but not present at all when utilizing bluetooth in my vehicle. After completing a restore of the device, people were still complaining about the feedback so I contacted Verizon Wireless. Their tech support passed me on to the advanced tech support team, and after troubleshooting reception issues and hearing the feedback for themselves, they decided that it had to be a hardware issue and that they were replacing the device. Tonight I received a call, and again the same feedback complaint in both handset and speakerphone mode. I then asked the person on the other end to hold-on because the only thing I had yet to try was to simply take the case off and see if the feedback problem was still there. It wasn't - not for the next 15 minutes of the conversation in handset or speakerphone mode; not in the subsequent calls made to test the device after that conversation was over. Anyway, I am returning the case tomorrow. I really do hate that it didn't work for me. Oh...and placing my corporate iPhone4 in the case - surprisingly there was no issue with it - it just happens with my 4S.
This case is not only Waterproof and durible! It feels nice in the hand and keeps the phone thin! I never usually buy a case or any accesory for 79.99, but when I got my iphone with no Applecare I figured i better stay on the safe side. Iphones are one of the most fragile phones on the market. You NEED something like this. The waterproof part is just an added bonus! Pros: Waterproof Sandproof Duribility All around feel Look Cons: Cost You lose some sound volume. You lose the slightest bit of touch accuracy (very little) Headphone jack is hard to get to, but added Headphone cable helps It's worth the investment just to throw you phone in a pool or take it in the shower just cause you can!!!
I've read the other reviews and while I agree with some of the grips, I would have to ask to some level what would you have expected? I ordered this case right from the dealer, didn't know Best Buy had them or I'd have gone there! So far I have been very pleased with the case. I will say I use my phone mostly for calls, texting and ipod but I do sometimes use the camera feature. Basically you are gonna get a case anyway, why not get complete protection. I will say, for those who live like me, my job has me working outside in the elements, I need not worry about my phone. I also ride a motorcycle and use my phones Ipod for music while riding. If you ride, when haven't you gotten stuck in some kind of rain event? Same with someone who exercises outside? Well, you need not worry about the phone. Lastly, if I'm not on the bike then we are in the Pines (a huge forest nearby) in our Jeep! For those who don't know, the Pines are predominately a sand area, full of deep to moderate puddles, but also can be extremely dry and dusty, and if you've wheeled them you know dirt/dust/water gets everywhere; in and out of your Jeep/vehicle and you! I'm sure it's like that other places too. I know many of our gang who wheel have Iphones and I'd highly suggest this case to any of them. As long as I have an Iphone, it will be wrapped in a Lifeproof case! IMHO you can't go wrong with this case if you like to live a little on the fun side out of work!
I ordered the gen2 case from their website which has additional bumpers to protect the volume and noise switch. I have to say this is an amazing case. Unlike the vast majority of cases you can purchase this case doesn't just cover your phone; it protects your phone. Even if you don't plan to jump into the pool and record your pool vacuum, the waterproof feature is awesome for when your phone is in a pocket (especially the chest pocket on ACUs) and you pour a good sweat. Unlike some other rugged cases such as the otterbox this one keeps the dirt and grim out that builds up on your phone when you don't take it out for a while. After being in the pocket of an army ranger for 2 weeks and keeping my phone alive it earns my full approval. They need to develop some android cases so all of my soldiers can keep their phones well protected. For the speaker muffled problem their site instructs you to blow into the vent with the phone removed to push the gortex cover off of it and it works pretty well.
ok so i purchased this case because i wanted to protect my phone when i go swimming and i want to make videos in the water. the waterproof part works great, i dropped my phone twice and if it did not have the case I'm sure i would have some ugly ding on the phone ( of course i exchanged the case at best buy after the drops) the biggest problem with the case is the sound when your phone rings its muffled i have missed at least 20 calls in the last month because of this. the sound when you are in the water filming is terrible but not many water proof cams have good sound while in the water so I'm not really going to blame the case. i Facebook and tweet a lot and even though the case is not that bulky it is still bulky enough to make typing fast a little annoying as does the plastic that protects the screen. playing games is a little off to because of it. so what you really have to ask yourself is if these little pet peeves are worth it and to be honest with the iPhone 4s coming out on the 14th and now apple care (99.00 only at time of purchase) covers accidental damage at a 49.00 fee is this case worth it. i will keep it but only during the summer after that it comes back out. I'm still waiting to see how it will affect the siri feature of the 4s. now the worst thing that i have no idea why they do this is if the case fails due to no fault of your own and the iPhone is damaged life proof does not pay for it. sounds strange for a company that says it protects the phone from water and shock and mud and dirt and so on. they should stand behind their product 100%
I have had this case since they came out in May. It has out performed all other cases I have owned. The Otterbox, Speck, Incase, etc. have nothing on this case. Adds very little bulk will not stick to pocket. The only complete waterproof case for iPhone. Awesome customer support from LifeProof. BADASS as close to bulletproof case you can buy. Please note: Screen will be slightly less responsive due to screen protector, but barely noticeable after using for a while. Small price to pay for such an outstanding case.
At first glance this phone case seems like the ULTIMATE of all iPhone 4 cases. It's Shock Proof, Waterproof, Dirt Resistant, Snow Proof, all for these qualities for a price tag of $80.00. Seems so great right? Why not spend the money for the ULTIMATE iPhone 4 case right? WRONG! Let's talk about the features of the Lifeproof Case. Problems are listed below. 1. It is not shock resistant whatsoever. It fell from the pocket of my hoodie, and a giant chunk near the upper right towards the back came flying off. Shock proof right? Nope. 2. Waterproof is great cannot debate that, but I can debate the sound quality out of your speaker, IT'S DULLED OUT! I have lost probably at least 30% of the actual speaker with the case on. Take a video with your case on and without the case, see the difference? 3. Photos and videos are a lot duller and less vibrant with this case on. 4. The most and last annoying feature on the phone case is that you have to keep unscrewing the top of the case to access the headphone port if you choose to exercise or use a headset. They do give you the expansion cord to make this less annoying but who wants a 6 inch wire hanging from your phone? Look, if you are the type of person who likes the advantages of taking videos under water and likes going out in the rain and jumping into a big puddle this case is for you. If you are the person that likes to hop on the toilet and play some games, text, and call people while on the can and you want the reassurance if you drop it down the toilet then this case is for you. Looks are deceiving, but you be the judge on it.
i ordered this case directly from their website. I have had it for approx 2 months and love it. This is hands down the best iPhone case
I need a tough case. Between the kids and myself my phone is dropped and exposed to different elements (water, dirt, sticky food covered fingers) on a constant basis. I don't need a case just to cover my phone I need one to protect my phone and this case does that. I didn't buy the case to be 'waterproof' but it's nice to be able to have the option to play angry birds or listen to music in the shower "just because". This case goes beyond my expectation and so has the LifeProof customer service.
When l first opened the LifeProof packaging I was initially shocked because the case looked so delicate & fragile - but looks are deceiving & once l had snapped it into place it was as solid as a rock, whilst still being as light as a feather. My initial installation did not go well because the screen did not sit straight in the top right-hand corner. After contact with LifeProof they suggested l re-install the case & boy did correct installation make a big difference, my screen now sits perfect. I also removed the tiny piece of plastic added to the LifeProof home button area, for me the home button works better without it. My top tips for installation are:- * Clean your phone impeccably * Unscrew & remove the top bung from the front cover piece * Place your phone into the front cover & then visually inspect your screen front to make sure it is perfect before snapping the back cover on * Screw the bung back in The case looks great & feels very comfortable in my hand. My screen is now flat & l have no issues playing any of the hundreds of iPhone games that l have amassed. For me the best feature is that it is waterproof! I enjoy taking my LifeProofed phone into the shower every day & listening to TuneIn Radio, as well as playing games & tweeting on it. This case has really grown on me & l love it.
This is the best iPhone case that I've ever had, and I've had them all. This case gives you the comfort of knowing that you can take your iPhone anywhere and not have to worry about it getting damaged if it gets wet, dropped, dirty, sat on by an elephant (hey, it could happen), or anything else that your daily life might throw at it. Have you ever wanted to play music on your phone while your in the shower? Now you can. Ever wish you could take your phone with you while snorkeling and get crystal clear videos of fish that you can't even pronounce? Now you can. Have you ever just wanted to dunk your phone in a pitcher of beer while drinking with your buddies? Now you can. The possibilities are endless with this case.
for everyone that has a iPhone knows what it feels like to not even want to move with the phone in your hand. the iPhone to be honest is the most fragile phone I've ever owned and fragile is not good in life. lifeproof has not only made me feel safe from falls, but everything life throws my way! my iPhone will never bethe same! lifeproof made me feel ok to carry my phone outside, made me feel ok to listen to music in the shower, made it ok for me to go to the beach and take pictures and not have to worry about my sons sand castles burring my phone underneath! it is the most amazing case you could possibly own! no juice, water, paint, sand, concrete and pretty much anything else will get in the way of things you want to enjoy! lifeproof took the iPhone to a whole different level! I could not be happier! then if that wasn't enough, the customer service is extraordinary! they treat each of their customers like a actual person and are always more than happy to do whatever they can to see their supporters happy! there's no question about it lifeproof is the way to go! it offers protection no other case can! worth every dime! 80 bucks now will save you that 400 dollars later when life proves to be to much for our phone! <3
I've been looking for a case for my iPhone 4 and never was happy with the looks or the protection that other cases offered. In my mind and imagination I knew what kind of case I wanted but nothing came close. Until I found lifeproof. This is the case that I dreamed about having. Lifeproof has finally designed an all around waterproof case that deems worthy and equal to the amazing iPhone 4. A perfect match truely made in heaven. Lifeproof went above and beyond my expectations. Pros. Crystal clear screen that lays flush to the phone. No bubbles or newtons oil effect. Excellent response using the screen and apps. All the buttons work flawlessly and easy to press. Phone calls and playing music is awesome. The look and feel of the case is like no other made. Smooth sleek and easy to hold. The outer edge of the case has an amazing rubberlike grip that feels soo right in your hand. Still using my original lifeproof case for several months now. I can honestly say that I will never have to buy another case again. My case still looks brand new even after using my lifeproof flyfishing in the rivers and lakes in Montana and Colorado. Finally a case that can truely stand up to the challenges and adventures in our everyday lives weather your scuba diving., white water rafting or just going shopping at the mall. Lifeproof it just works.
This case is tough water proof dirt proof and it looks sweet if u dont have one u need to get one
Took a chance on this iPhone case and so glad i did. Conpletely waterproof. First time i took it in the pool people looked at me like I was crazy. Now they all want one. This case is awesome. No more worries. freedom to take your iphone anywhere. Hands down the best most complete protection for your iPhone
This case has it all light weight sleek and works! We took ours diving 12ft and got great videos ! they also come in pink and purple if you go to Lifeproof web page :) if you have an iPhone u must have a Lifeproof case
I originally had purchased the other "top brand" case but promptly returned it once I found the Lifeproof at Best Buy. The other case was too bulky and offered little or no protection to the speakers/mic/cameras. Lifeproof took care of those issues for me, plus it provides usage that no other case can. I don't have to concern myself about the status of my phone when I go to the beach or worry when I get caught in a rainstorm. No similar issues as mentioned in the earlier posts. If you watch the install and care videos then you shouldn't have a problem. This is the single best investment I have ever made for a product. I am overly satisfied with the level of protection it gives to my iPhone and thoroughly enjoy the comfort and peace of mind that goes with it. Check out their website, watch the videos, look on YouTube, read the reviews, and see for yourself. I did and I'm happy with the results!
I can't find one flaw with this case. Absolutely amazing! Nothing on the market matches or comes close to it. It's a must have! Well worth the money. Essential to anyone with a life, no matter how hectic. I can't recommend this case enough. Just get lifeproofed as soon as possible! :)
This case a little on the pricey side, well worth it ! I have had no screen issue like some people claim. I did take the time to watch the instructional videos. The case has a great feel to it very light weight all the buttons work fine volume buttons a little stiff. Sielent switch works great. The case does come with a head phone adapter. I will say this case is so much better than most out there. This will be the cases I buy for my iPhone 4.
The LifeProof cases delivered on everything it promised and then some. A waterproof case that never has to come off at the same time being sleek, sexy, and protective. No better protection for your investment.
I have had 4 of these cases for 3 months. This case is absolutely perfect. I have taken it swimming, taken videos underwater, listened to music underwater. Talked in the pouring rain on the phone. The phone is totally waterproof with all the phones functions. My screen protector has always sat flush with the screen with no gap. If anyones case has a gap, that gap with go away within a matter of days to a week of carrying it in your pocket. I have a 3 black and a white case. I use the black mainly and after 3 months of use it does not have a scratch on it. I am an auto mechanic and the case goes through serious hard useage. I am hard on it and like I said it does not have a scratch on it. For the life of me I cannot figure out what the people are doing with their phone to get scratches on it. The case is slick and slides right in and out of my pocket without sticking and pulling my pocket inside out. It gathers no lint like the other 2 big name brand cases, of which I had both and are now in a junk drawer. I have dropped the phone a few times with no damage to the case or the phone. I have never had any issue with anyone not being able to hear me. The camera and flash works even better than it does with the naked phone. The screen sensitivity matches that of the naked phone. I will NEVER EVER use any other case again. I wont buy a new phone unless LifeProof makes a case for it. They have impeccable customer support and will take care of you if you have any problems.
best case to protect your iphone4....and it's completely waterproof!!! I will never use another case again....
The case is advertised as waterproof and I believe it. It is smaller and lighter than the (other big name), and more expensive. It also advertises it is shockproof and I accept that, too. It is a solid piece of equipment. Once you get the IPhone it, it'll be tough to get it back out. Operationally, at least on mine, there is a gap between the case's cover and the phone's screen. It takes a firmer finger push especially near the edges. Bottom line, I like it, even with some quirks.
I've been waiting months for this case to be released for the iPhone 4 ever since I saw the initial video of the people using the iPhone under water while on the beach. There's no doubt that this case appears to be extremely durable, but it seems to be lacking in two major areas that I, personally, could not overlook. I purchased two of these cases yesterday (9/25/11) from my local Best Buy store, one for my wife and one for myself, and both of them are being returned tomorrow. The overall fit and finish of the case is very nice, and it has a very slim profile which is a very welcome feature with all the other "heavy duty" type cases sometimes doubling the size of the iPhone itself. One key note is that the Lifeproof case definitely adds some length to the iPhone. The bottom of the case (where the data port is located) is extended quite a bit I assume for waterproofing and durability, but just let it be known that it makes the phone noticeably longer. I'd say 1/2' or so. I purchased the black case for myself, and I immediately noticed that the back half of the case is hard plastic, and instantly shows scratches and scuffs. Using the "finger nail test" resulted in permanent marks that would not come off. I can only imagine that over time, the scratches would get worse and worse. My wife, on the other hand, got the white case and it didn't show any scratches at all. The front half of the case is a hard plastic but has a soft rubberized feel to it, which I like a lot. I suppose they left the hard plastic on the back to help slide easier in and out of your pocket, not sure. Okay, the two flaws that now have us returning the cases. The front of the case is basically one large built-in screen protector, which seems to be very well made like the rest of the case, except for one HUGE problem. To keep the case waterproof, yet still allowing you to hear sound from the speaker, they had to sandwich a rubber gasket between the screen protector and the phone itself, around the speaker hole area. This creates a "bulge" if you will, right by the speaker area which lifts the entire screen protector off the screen. By having this "gap" between the screen protector and the screen, doing things like........TYPING.......... becomes a bit of a daunting task, forcing you to have to actually push on the screen to get things to work instead of just lightly tapping. The Lifeproof website FAQ's mention this issue, and say that it's just air trapped between the screen protector and the screen, but after trying everything they say to fix the issue, nothing changed, nor do I see how it ever will. With the rubber gasket between the protector and the glass it will always have a gap. Problem #2: The data port. Like I mentioned previously, the case is longer than the phone itself, and it comes with a cover that snaps over the data port, which actually has a very nice feel to it with a very positive "click" when snapped closed, but the problem is that I have yet to find an aftermarket data/charging cable that fits in this port hole. It was clearly designed for the oem Apple data cable, and NOT aftermarket designs. I have a bunch of 6ft cables that I bought from various places, which include a locking mechanism that cannot be unlocked when using this case. The case is so deep in the data port area that the data plug itself actually goes partially inside the case. What this means is that if I plug in my locking cables, there's no way for me to unlock them to get them back out, and I'm not going to go out and re-buy a whole bunch of cables after spending $70+ on this case. My AT&T brand car charger won't even work anymore because the plug is too long. I was able to jam it in the hole, but I could see how repeated use of the charger would eventually damage either the charger or the case or both. In summary, the case itself is a great idea, and seems to do it's job well in regards to durability, but when it comes to practical use of the product, it falls short. After all, it's great to have a case that protects the phone in every way, but if you can't use the phone anymore, what's the point?? I'm returning the two I bought and will be putting the money toward a SquareTrade warranty instead.
Not too impressed. First of all, for those wanting to take your multi-hundred $$$ phone into the water for pictures and video, you're a dummy. Buy an underwater camera that is designed for that. Too many reviews about leakage. What I don't like particularly is that the screen does not lie flat so I have to push extra forceful to get it to register. Highly annoying. I don't have time for my phone to unresponsive. The mute (vibrate) switch also has to be pushed forcefully. I couldn't fit my charger into the port even after I took the back cover off. The back is a sort of plastic that doesn't give me that confident feeling that it will protect it much. The only thing that feels protective is the perimeter. The quality of sound is greatly reduced as well, by at least 50%. Too many irritating things for me to "settle" for it. I'm getting rid of it.
I have had this case for 6 months and loved it for about 2. I have developed a tear in the rubber that cover the volume on/off switch so my phone is no londer dirt and water proof. The holster which i boudht seperatelt for 35 bucks has broken twice. The pic that holds the clip has walked out of position and required me repair it so I dont lose my phone. Overall the Otter was better. I'm disappointed because I really liked it.
The case did work for a while. When plugging and unplugging the charger over time the case cracked. At least I took the phone out of the case at least twice a month to clean it and submerged it for testing otherwise I would have lost my phone.
I would like to shed some new light on the life proof case. I was also fooled by the amazing videos and advertisement life proof put out to sell there product. I bought mine like 2 months ago. followed the video instructions for the water test and so forth. I fell in love with this case. I thought this is the best case in the world. Then i kept hearing how the life proof case has failed and life proof will warranty the case but not the phone if damaged. Many people are fooled in the wording life proof has put out to think they will also warranty the phone. They do not. Since i bought the case i have never taken my phone out of the case. I use my phone everyday at the gym with earbuds. It is a Pain to remove the plug and put in the adaptor everytime but i figured its worth it, right. Not even two months of use the adaptor shorted out, makeing my earbuds useless at the gym. This was strick 1 against the life proof product. Then when people were telling me there phone got wet even in the case i decided to remove my phone for a test. Once i opened up the case i found dust inside. Not alot of dust but some. This is stike 2. I snapped the case back to gether with out my phone in it, screwed the head phone plug in and closed the charge port door. Pressed all around the case again to make sure everything was snapped together and sealed. I did the water test again to check to see after 2 months if my phone was still protected. I let it set in water for about 5 hours before taking it out. Once i pulled it out i found alot of water inside the case. Thank god my iphone was not in the case. I decided i would rather be extra carefull with my iphone around water and with out a case like this then to believe that the life proof case will protect my phone. Never again life proof will i trust your product to protect something that is worth so much money. $80.00 for not ever two months worth of use, Come on. Take your product off the market cause its worthless.
I had one. It failed. Called them and they said tough luck sucker and took NO responsibility even though I went through all the testing they suggested.
I have had the case for eight months. Today I accidentally washed my jeans with my Iphone in the Lifeproof case in the pocket.. The Lifeproof case failed completely and my phone is toast. If you are an outdoor person I would not depend on the Lifeproof case to keep your phone dry.
The case is a little bit expensive. But overall I would recommend it to my friends.
The main thing I do not like is the sound quality when trying to listen to music. I've used it underwater for pictures and video and it works great with no water damage to my phone so overall, it's a success. Gives me great security when I'm out in the rain or around a pool.
Case is great for people that keep dropping the phone on water and on the floor i recommend this if you want to protect your invement of 199.99
i haven't had any trouble with it so far. easy to take off and on if needed.
i used my phone in the pool like the prduct promotes and my iphone recieved water damage and when i contacted lifeproof they didnt honor their waranty on my iphone so now i have a case that doesnt work and a broken iphone!
I love my case. Since I haven't gotten the belt clip yet, I carry it in my back pocket without fear of breaking iPhone front glass. It could have a more durable front shield but that could interfere with overall function. It's sleek, slim, and light weight. Even looks nice, clean, and professional. Great accessory to protect my phone. I had just bought an OtterBox 2 weeks before I saw this and quickly changed cases much to my husbans's dismay. OtterBox is $50 which was pretty much wasted. I wouldn't trade the Life Proof for anything.
I bought this case to replace an otter box I've had for about a year. After about a month the waterproof membrane that covers the earpiece had torn. A few weeks after that the plug cover cracked rendering it useless, and now the case itself has developed a crack. It's not worth $20 let alone $80, very disappointed.
Tested case without phone and it was waterproof. Used in the pool not deeper than 3' and it worked fine for about a week. After a week it got wet #not submerged# and the phone wouldn't charge. Took it do Apple store and both moisture sensors were tripped red. I suggestion is it works good for rain but keep it on the table not near the pool.
I am an avid fisherman and waterfowl hunter. With a lot of time spent on the water, dealing with a cell phone is always a hassle. The idea of the LifeProof case was fantastic and it worked great for about the first 6 months. About 7 months into my ownership, the plastic pieces on the case began cracking. I did not abuse the case or drop it excessively. Any cracks in the case completely negated my reasoning for buying it--being waterproof. As a finance guy, the insurance is probably a better investment than this case, which is how I approached the decision. I knew the case wouldn't last forever, but expected it to last for more than a year, anyway.
The case completely protects the phone but in doing so also impacts the way the microphone you speak into works. In other words the case works so well that the microphone doesn't allow for callers to hear you - so the phone wont get damaged by the elements but it ends up making the phone useless to make calls. The way I would get callers to hear me was by unsnapping the bottom portion of the phone which opens up a channel to the speaker. This works but I could see this leading to the snapping piece becoming worn out. My brother in-law has this same case and wasn't experiencing this issue - may have been an issue with my product.
Very practical. Need $30 adapter purchased separately to work with docking station. With adapter spent over $100. Price needs to be lower.
I have had this case for about a month now and I love it. I had a defender by otter box before and it was bulky and broke on me. I only wish these cases were just a little less expensive.
Purchased to replace OtterBox case. Fits well, looks good. I was quite disappointed with the charger as it's difficult to plug in and remove charger for 4S.
this product was good, waterproof, durable but couldn't stand up to puppy teeth. i left my phone or case on the sofa for a few seconds and my pup made some good dents and pierced the screen. i was not able to return my product. also it does scratch easily.. but i liked it just that it was useless to me once my puppy pierced the case.
Saw the advertisement for this case in a fishing magazine and I thought it would be perfect for my frequent fishing trips because of the waterproof feature. Don't believe it! I tested it as recommended and watched the video as recommended and used it the way they said to. Only 2 months old, I had it it my pocket while wading. Took it out to take a picture and the lens was fogged. Tuurns out that water somehow got in and ruined my phone. Called Lifeproof and their service was horrible. The only thing they would do is send me another case which was useless since I had to buy another phone, IPhone 5, and the 4 case wouldn't fit anyway. It does not perform as advertise and the service is horrible so I would stay away.
I just purchased my case yeaterday. So far i have enjoyed using this lifeproof case. I gave this product 4 stars because the only complaints I have about it would be the sensitivity with the touch screen. It's not the easiest thing to use. You really have to practice using the case writing text messages and emails to get comfortable with it. The sound could be louder because the technology of the can funnels the sound to the of the case. It does sound muffled, you can however open the charge port door and the sound is very crisp again. I have already done numerous water tests as well as using it in the shower and it works just as described! I am very impressed. I am going to continue to use the case for the next few weeks to make sure I'm 100% satisfied. I have read the Q & A from lifeproof.com which indicates the screen should flatten completely in a week or so.
I have the Otterbox case and the Life Proof case! I like the Otterbox case and it's nice! But it's bulky and I would like to have my iPhone with me! Just in case I'm around water! You can't do that with the Otterbox case! But with the Life Proof case, it works PERFECTLY! I tried it underwater for 1 hour without the iPhone in it! After I submerged in the sink, the case was wet, but when I took the case apart, it was TOTALLY DRY! Not one drop of water inside the case! Now that's WATERPROOF! And I can finally take my iPhone to the beach and get it wet! Without damaging the iPhone! Lifeproof, your my LIFE SAVER! If you want a case to protect your iPhone, then the Life Proof case IS THE ANSWER!
I bought my iPhone 4S about 6 months ago and was researching cases. I stumbled upon this one and thought... GREAT A waterproof case will leave nothing to chance... Wrong I was! On the 4th of July I went to a pool party and thought that this was a great opportunity to use my case. I used it and everything was fine... until I started to go under water. I noticed condensation on the case and came out of the water. I opened it up and my phone was soaked and dead. Lucky I had insurance so I got a new phone... Lifeproof SUCKS!!!!!!!!! Don't get their cases you will regret it!.
I would buy it again without a doubt great product
It fell apart within a week! It was a complete waste of money! If you want to throw $40 down the drain buy this piece of Junk!! Great way to waste money!!
This things sucks!!! Te fabric on the sides started peeling within a few days. Now I have to walk around with a $40 case that looks like garbage!!
I had it for 3 weeks and the fabric all started coming off.
Did not fit my iphone 4 at all! It was too long. Case extended a good inch and a half above my phone.
Great case. Not too bulky and it does not take away from the phone's look. Easy to withdraw and insert to/from holster without struggling.
I have owned a thunderbolt, samsung galaxy nexus both of which I have purchased platinum series case/ covers for ( very nice!..purchased this case for my iphone4s on 8/24/12 and once again platinum series delivers great results.. Form fitting, light weight and does not take away from the natural feel of the iPhone when in your hand.
This was a great case for me for about 6 months, then the belt clip broke. Pretty worthless now.
This is a great holster for the lifeproof iphone case. Phone fits in either front facing or rear facing for more protection.
Nice for a short time. To much money for a clip A cheap made one at that
It's very durable. Not overly comber some. Only problem I have is you can't charge your phone while it's still on the clip.
I use this belt clip on a daily basis. I work hard and play harder, and the Lifeproof case is the perfect amount of durability and sleekness. The belt clip is a great accessory as it enables you to use your lifeproof in a more professional setting. The belt clip is extremely durable, doesnt damage the case like some clips can, and when locked, you literally cannot "shake" the phone from the clip, and even when unlocked, it is still very strong at holding onto the phone. The only thing I don't like about the clip is the fact that once you install one of the sized clips, it will be permanent. It is understood that you need it to be permanent, but it would be nice to be able to swap the clips out for different situations.
Very durable and secures the phone very well. I love the locking feature and that it lets you pick the size of the belt clip. I prefer my Lifeproof case and clip over the Otter box.
A disappointment. Easy to remove phone from cradle one handed, but not easy to replace one handed. If not locked in place properly phone falls out.
This belt clip fulfills all of my expectations. It is study, strong and well-built. The phone (even in its LiteProof case) fits snugly in the holster and can be placed so either the face of the phone faces out or the back faces out. [I turn my phone so the back faces out for protection of the phone face. Of course, that is probably not necessary because of the construction of the LiteProof iPhone case, which protects the face of the phone.] The one drawback is that the clip is a bit pricey but it works like a charm and I would recommend it to anyone. One word of caution to buyers of the belt clip. It comes with two clips; one of wide belts and one for narrow belts. Make sure you know which you want to use because once the clip is attached to the holster, you can't change it. The instructions point this out but it is worth mentioning again.
I had this case for about two-three weeks. I must admit that I do put my phones through the ringer and this case did do a great job of protecting my iPhone. My problem with it though is after only a couple of weeks the fabric on the bottom of the case started to fray and the glue that held the fabric on had dried up. Subsequently, the strip of fabric that runs up the side of the case had come off. In terms of practicality, it kept my phone together just fine. Speck makes fine products but just stay away from the ones with fabric. Another pet peeve, and this is based on preference, the apple on the back isn't visible with this case.
the cover is a good one but dose not fit the phone very tight and i feel it could fall out. if there is a hard case i would get that over this.
I would like to first start by saying that this case is form maximum protection, so it is not a slim sleeve. The majority of slim cases offer no protection if your phone is dropped. This case is exceptional and is built well. It is easy to grip and does not feel like it will fall out of your hands. The built in screen protector is awesome an extremely responsive. Additionally, Otterbox stands behind their products. This is a great case for those wanting to protect their iPhone. This case looks great and while it does add some bulk to the phone, it is not gaudy. My least favorite part of this case is the clip, but I have gotten use to it. I do not put my phone in my pocket. I would rather wear it. The built in screen protector is amazing. For those who have yet to experience the fun of putting on a Zagg or like protector, I would recommend this case. Since it is built into the case, you do not need to worry about air bubbles. It really is amazing. Features: Three layers of protection Complete interaction of the device's functions Ratcheting belt clip holster included Material: Clear protective membrane on touch screen High-quality polycarbonate shell Durable silicone skin I would also recommend the Otterbox Commuter or Reflect or Ballistic SG for those looking for a smaller case, but still wanting protection. Remember that your key points of protection are the 4 corners of the case. These are your points of impact usually when dropped. You want to make sure that you have something to absorb the shock. Lastly, while fashion is something we all want, remember to think about protecting your investment. That is what a "good" case will do.
I have gotten this case for Christmas, and am loving every second of owning this case! It comes with a built-in screen protector, ad well as 2 levels of impact protection. The only thing this is not, is water-proof. Well, that's why there is the life-proof case. The case is a little over priced, but still good. If I were you, a case that is really worth EVERY PENNY of your hard earned money, get the mophie juice pack air. But all and all, this case is great.
I went to bestbuy to get this phone and the salesperson was very helpful. He explained all the prepaid plans to me and the phones they carry. I had Optimus v from lg and had pretty much done my homework beforehand, i was thinking about evo 4g or iPhone. Since there is no 4g in my usage area, and I also have a Samsung Infuse from work, I decided to take iPhone 4s. I like the simplicity of the iOS, which is stable, smooth and fast on iphone 4s, yet miss the customization , file system access and deep apps integration in Android. I find text very sharp, clear and easy to read on the iPhone. I do wish the screen to be bigger, it looks small next to my infuse. I also personally love the super amoled plus screen more than the retina display on iPhone. When I watch a video, super amoled plus display looks like a mini plasma tv that is able to show true black color, though some may find their colors cartoonish. That said, iPhone 4s does have great color accuracy and holding and using it feels natural with one hand. The cameras are great, the flash isn't the best which is very understandable. I do not like the glass back at all, I would rather have a less fragile phone, but a case can help. Battery life is not so great, but there are many added on battery cases out there. Overall I like the iPhone 4s on virgin mobile, I find the price high for the phone, but this is a lot better than having a contract. Setting up the phone was easy, virgin mobile has a very easy to use website. Data speed isn't fast, yet listening to pandora is not a problem. Voice calls are good for my area too.
When I got the phone the best buy salesman told me he had to set it up and I would get a different number which I did not want to do. So I let him do it. Then he told me it was all set up. I went home and could not get it to work then I went on line to my virgin account re registered the phone, and guess what it worked with my old number!!! Maybe sales people should just give the phone to existing virgin customers and let them set up there own phones???
My mother was really tired of paying $130 a month on a carrier for unlimited everything, After doing some reasearch and convincing my mother not to resign up for another two year's and go prepaid. I was happy to see the iphone 4s come to Virgin Mobile, I told her you will save a lot of money. We were able to get her number ported over from a Big Carrier to Virgin Mobile but it was a all night thing due to error with a best buy worker not paying attention to the correct phone number to port, but was quickly corrected, we waited all day and could not figure out why it was still not activated. Finally my mother decided to call customer service, while she was on the phone with customer service. Their was info on how to get it activated and here is my major tips for you guys: 1. If your phone is on : Do a Factory Reset , PS Make sure you write down your contact's 2. Make sure you are connected to Wifi Network, Use your own wifi 3. Complete the steps to get your iphone activated and running this is the easy part 4. when done and at your home screen if you only see bar's but no 3g, turn your phone off completely , wait 10 second's and power it back on 5. and Finally Wait Patiently it may seem like it did not work if it says ( Searching or No Service ) Give it at least 15 min's it should show the carrier name VIRGIN , tower bar's and 3g After all this was done my mother went from a iphone 4 black on a carrier to Virgin Mobile Iphone 4s in White She loves it so much from Call quality, to ease of use, its much more zippy than her last Iphone and With unlimited Talk, Text and Web for only 50 buck's a month if you set up Auto pay plus tax My last statement: The whole reason for getting a nice phone is to beable to make call's , use application's, text, MMS, browse the web and more with no Issues, Trust me on this Apple Make's the best quality Smartphone and Set's the bar way high and excell's , you will not reget it
After being a heavy Android user over that years. I need a phone that could help me with reminders and information. Decided to jump on the iPhone 4S before the iPhone 5 was released. SIRI is my god send. Not accurate, but with use over time. The back end server will improved. It is just like going to school. We had to learn and learn to get that degree. Virgin Mobile is a bargain with cheap phone plans and use of the Sprint Network. I do not go over the 2.5GB data limit. on 3G data. Thought it was foolish to pay extra 10.00 for Sprint 3G data. Now my bill is at a nice 54.00 every month. Unlimited minutes and text. Sprint was over 100.00 for the same phone. Verizon and AT&T even more. Downside was paying full price for iPhone and not having unlock capabilities.
Love having an iphone through Virgin Mobile -- the monthly charge can't be beat even if the upfront charge is more for the phone. I figure we'll come out ahead in about 8 months. On the down side, the 16gb is not big enough to hold all my music and games but I was able to weed through alot of my music. The battery doesn't make it through more than 1.5 days but all in all loving this phone!!
Virgin Mobile is one of the first prepaid providers to offer the iPhone 4S, and at a cost of $649, it isn't for the casual shopper. However, Virgin's monthly plan of $35 for unlimited data (2.5GB of which are up to 4G speeds) and unlimited texts plus 300 minutes cannot be beat, and undercuts contract iPhone plans by nearly $50 a month, so that is where the long-term savings will come into play. Virgin Mobile runs off of Sprint's network, so that means great coverage in major cities and on major highways, but spotty coverage in many rural areas. The phone's performance is just like other iPhones on other providers so you basically know what you are going to get with that as Virgin's model is identical.
I was with AT&T and then with Verizon. With each company I had a 400 or 450 minute plan with texting and data. In total after an employee discount from a organization I worked with my bill was $85 or $90 a month. (without tethering) With a 2 year commitment required that means I would pay $2040 for service and $250 to $350 for the phone. I found that with AT&T they charge a activation fee or an upgrade fee for the first month. So the $200 is the "come on" and after their activation and/or upgrade fee the total was $50 more before tax. Total for 2 years $2290. Virgin Unlimited is $53 (with the bill charged to your credit card automatically-including tax) so for 2 years the service is $1272 add the iphone cost of $700 total is $1972. Thing is i didn't ever get close to using the phone 500 minutes a month. So I have a plan that is $42 a month for 1200 total minutes total for 2 years including phone $1710 or a $500 savings and if after a year and 1/2 I want a new iPhone I can buy a new one and not have to pay a penalty. That freedom speaks loads. Sprint service on the iPhone is better than what I was getting on my HTC with Verizon or Samsung my roommate had with AT&T. Yes the internet is only 3g, but I haven't had any problems with not having any internet which was a constant problem on the HTC phone with Verizon even after they replaced the phone twice. I did but a Mobi Juice Pack air so I have extended battery life (no it's not as dainty as the phone without the extra battery, but the battery slides on and off easily so if I don't need the extra battery life for a night out I just slide it off) In my car the bluetooth quickly connects and with so many options and SIRI it's wonderful. I love to ask it questions that are simple but any other computer wouldn't be able to handle. Like "Do I need to take an umbrella today?" and it will tell you that it is or isn't likely to rain. Even though IOS is starting to look dated it's still the easiest to navigate. My only thing that I miss from android is the time and weather widget. But..... making a call, texting, or syncing with a computer is so much easier and easier with the iPhone that I don't miss it "that much" and my phone doesn't freeze.
love my new iphone. i like the cheaper monthly cost. speed is ok ( i' always connected to my wifi)
I bought this phone after being a Virgin Mobile customer for 8 years thinking that this was going to be the answer to all of my smartphone dreams on a prepaid network. I was so wrong and my dream became a nightmare. I used the phone for about a week in full functioning order. After that, I was not able to use the 3G network or Wifi for downloading anything. A smartphone is useless without these functions. Then I went back to Best Buy multiple multiple times to figure out what was wrong. I went through 3 iPhones from Virgin and each one worked less and less on their network until I had an iPhone that couldn't even connect to cell service at all. The Best Buy workers were very confused as to why this was happening but said that I was not the first one who had come back with major problems. I got to a point of serious frustration with the iPhone and the terrible tech support provided by Virgin that I returned the phone. Being without a phone for two weeks and have their tech people tell me there was nothing they could do to help me was not ok with me. It didn't seem like they were even aware that Virgin sells an iPhone and were no help in trying to get it fixed. Lets just say this was the last frustrating issue I'm willing to go through with Virgin and am planning to switch to a real cell phone company at the soonest time possible. DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE AND DO NOT START UP A NEW ACCOUNT WITH VIRGIN. It will only bring you frustration and head aches.
I wanted a case that had a way to easily clip the phone on my belt. This is perfect. I only need to use the clip when I want it clipped on my belt, otherwise it is a normal case. My husband's iPhone case has a plastic button over the power button on the top that lets you power off the screen. That would be handy on this case. But overall, I really love the case. The color is perfect (it comes in other colors) and the matte finish on the case does not collect fingerprints - looks very nice.
I really love this case for my iPhone. After trying out others, this one is different. It feels really good in your hands and is not slippery. Stays on your phone too. Also very thin but sturdy so fits in my handbag pocket easily. Definitely recommend!
After only a week of having the Platinum case with holster it came apart from where it snaps together and my BRAND NEW iPhone 4s fell out of it, denting it in the corner. From then on it kept coming apart. I returned it to the store and got a skin for my iphone 4s instead. I loved that it had a holster but needs to be better made where the case divides in two and snaps together. They need to make a snap button for it or make it all one piece. Regret ever buying it!!!!
Not worth the cost. EVO has much more functionality. Only 4s benefit is ability to use as iPod.
Pros: This phone is fast and as many apps as I have added, it still holds up the speed. This makes a great team with other Mac products. Not only do I sync music, but I also sync emails, iCal, and stream wirelessly to my MacBook Pro. The 8 MP camera takes great photos and videos in Hi-def 720p. The past month, I have been getting use to Siri which has been handy and time efficient. Cons: I have a small crack in the corner. Right now, I have an otter box protecting it. When doing A LOT of texting or web surfing, the battery lasts only about 6 hours, otherwise it can last a day and half. Sometimes I wish it had 4G, and Sprint isn't the BEST service; however, I do like having unlimited data. Overall: This phone is great. With the exception of 4G, I like it more than the Galaxy S3, and EVO 4G LTE. I would recommend an iPhone to a friend, but I would also recommend to wait till the next model as I assume it will release before the end of the year and it will enable 4G,
I made the right choice. It has been very useful for all my needs.
Where to start? I am trilled with this phone! I have an iPad, and have had several iPods, so I was familiar with how to use it, which made it a lot easier for me. I had 2 Samsung Galaxies before this phone, so I'm still no used to such a small screen but that is really the only complaint that I have. The camera is Awsome. The speed at which the programming works is outstanding. I am an over the road truck driver, so I'm all over the country and the call quality Is better than most. I do wonder why Sprint didn't ask that it be made 4G compatible though?
Great phone in every way a phone should be. You already know great interface and great apps. Only thing I would have like is lte for when that is available but honestly having had 4g in evo before have found sprint 3G to be more the adequate for what I do and haven't missed the sometimes faster speeds of the clear wire network.
Once you go iPhone....you never go back! I love it!
I havent had the iphone that long but so far so good. I am very happy with it. So much better than the androids. I would definatly pass along that everyone should have a Iphone.My Mom Can't wait for the iphone 5 to come out.
Best Buy was running a promotion. Renew your phone and get $50 gift card. I was able to apply to purchase of the iPhone 4s. Phone has been working great. no issues.
With just my everyday to day life, I feel the iphone surpasses all other phones. Very fluid moving from app to app and its compatibility with all and most accesorries is in comparison to none!! TEAMiPhone...just wish it was 4G!
well it is easy to use it, it is the perfect size if you like to have it in your pocket i like it but if you don't have a Wi-Fi connection is way too slow and more when you want to watch a video or download an app also brousing is slow.
Best phone ever, blows away android phones... Love this phone
Beats the heck out of my previous Android phones! I love all the Apps that are available...they're so much better than Android as well.
Having used a Pre, and several Droids, I finally made the switch to the Iphone. So far, I love the phone. I am disappointed that a $50 gift card is now available, I should have waited or it should be offered for this upgrade.
The transition to the iPhone 4S from an HTC II windows-based phone was so easy I could hardly believe it. And the iPhone 4S is far superior in every way. I'm so glad I didn't settle for one of the lesser phones. This phone is worth the money. It's so easy to work with that even my senior husband can use it, something impossible with the HTC II. Apple, thank you so much for putting me in a new dimension..
I love the speed of the iphone. I really like the usefullness of all the apps. The one thing I don't like is the fact that even though I bought Apple products (iphone, 2 itouches, many ipods, ipad, multiple itunes apps and music, etc.), I still have to pay to icloud my apple devices together. Plus, a large number of apps I used to have on my evo android that were free, cost money to get them for Apple. If it weren't for those items, this would be a 5 star.
I have an Iphone 4S and bought this new one for my daughter as an upgrade. Seeing she has had several Ipods and Itouches and a Macbook Pro she is very comfortable with using this phone and is very happy with it. Her Mom has an Android HTC EVO and my daughter is constanly helping her with and says the Android is a pain.
This is the greatest phone I've ever owned and I've had at least 15 cellphones in my time. When you buy a Blackberry it comes with a manual the size of a college text book. The Iphones instruction manual is a double sided pamphlet that can be read in 10 minutes cover to cover. What I'm amazed by is how easy this phone is to use. Siri is ok, doesn't impress me all that much. Camera is great, very impressive! This phone has cost me so much money because I'm now an Apple user for life. Purchased a Mac Pro Laptop 2 weeks after my Iphone purchase! Enjoy, you'll love it. I've read some negative reviews about this product but most had to do with availability issues. The other complaint was that it is glass and can break. Really? No kidding, buy a protective case! I've dropped mine twice already and it keeps on ticking!
This is a wonderful product. Sleek design with stunning features. Feels very solid in one's hand.
I have owned all 5 iPhones and each one keeps getting better. They add features that seem like something ahead of their time or things you might not want or need. I wasn't sure if Siri and slightly improved specs were enough to upgrade from the iPhone 4. But once you get comfortable using Siri you will use it on an almost daily basis. The phone is super fast and blow away thoswe Android phones that need to be reset every couple days to ensure they keep running. I haven't turned my iPhone 4s off in over a month and it's still running as fast as the day I took it out of the box! I had an Android phone and needed anti-virus and app-killing apps. The iPhone suffers from neither of those issues and is the most user-friendly product on the market. If you have common-sense you can figure out how to use Apple products quickly. I had my Android for 3 months and still didn't understand how to do some simple tasks. Apple products may cost slightly more than the competition but it's worth the cost. -No virus issues -No slowdown in performance based on how many apps you have open or length of time since last reset -Great accessories (Apple TV, wireless printing w/ HP, wireless sync, iTunes store# -Biggest app store -One operating system with easy upgrades #Anroid has 2.2, 2.3, 3.2, 4.0 and it's difficult to upgrade when a new version comes out and some companies don't offer upgrade ability)
My iphone completely gave up on life after less than a month. Aside from the obvious product failure complaint, I don't like the fact that the iphone 4s doesn't link with my car's bluetooth system (2011 Chrysler 300 with UConnect.) I don't think the iphone is any better than my previous android phone. I honestly regret purchasing it.
They just released it and its already behind the curb apple should get things ahead before releasing their phones
This is the product Apple has been striving for all these years: elegant, intuitive, a perfect blend of form and function that fits nicely in the hand and dazzles the eye and the mind with tons of 21st century features. SIRI, especially, is a lady with whom both you AND your wife will be having an affair! The list of ways in which she can make your life easier will amaze and delight you - from finding a gas station or hotel to retrieving and replying to your messages on the run to playing your favorite songs on command - SIRI will be your new best friend. GREAT phone, discovering new ways to use and enjoy it every day.
I had been wavering between the Galaxy S2 and this for weeks before release. I'm 100% sure I made the right choice. The androids may have better specs, but the iPhone 4S is just silky smooth to operate. I've had a droid phone before but I'm never going back. There is nothing like an operating system that is made for a specific phone. This what makes this thing run so well. Plus the size is perfect (not a Zack Morris phone feel in the hands). The app store beats the heck out of the droid market for high quality apps. Not to mention tons of free quality apps. The camera is one of the best I've seen and Siri is amazing. The only negative on the phone is no 4G network. But let's face it, if you have Sprint, that won't matter for long. Sprint is building its own 4G LTE network for 2013. This means all the 4G sprint phones now wonthave 4G functionality either due to different (WiMax) hardware. And by then we will all be getting new phones anyways. My only regret was not getting the 64GB model. 32GB is a lot but I have a 4100 song, 20 movie library. So I've had to cut out 1500 songs and 15 movies. Still plenty. And this gives me enough room for the 45 free apps I have and 5 paid apps (which were only $1 each). Get this phone, you won't regret it. P.S. I had no problem rolling into my local Best Buy on Oct . 18th and picking one of these up without a pre-order. Guess inventory problems vary by region.
Got some advice for best buy.. Don't take pre-orders without knowing your inventory. Even if it is big shot apple...They started fulfilling their orders earlier than best buy did, so "We dont know how many we are going to get" is poor and unacceptable statement from your employees.
I was desparately wanting to switch from Android to Apple, as my HTC Evo 4G was running like an old dog. I was constantly needing to reboot it all the time, and that was like a 10 minutes process. I'm so happy I made the change. Now if only Sprint can get both voice and data working together.
I finally took the leap from do nothing flip phone into the twenty first century.. This phone has been a pain free jump. My daughter now looks at me in disbelief when she tries to show me something Ive already learned.
I was on the AT&T network and moved to Sprint. I have had no issues at all with my phone on the Sprint network. At the office I constantly stream audio from SiriusXM, it's great.
I've had my case much longer than my new phone thanks to delayed shipping. The case looks great. Very easy to put the phone into verses similar designed/priced cases. However now that my phone is finally here I'm afraid the case has to go back. Though it says compatible with 4/4s it's not fully. There is no access for the vibrate switch just above the physical volume controls. For meetings I will either have to take the phone out of the case to flip the switch or hope that by turning the volume down and changing some settings hope that I can make the phone quiet enough. It would be a great case if there was access to all of the external, physical features.
This case looks great, I am sure it does a good job of protecting your phone. Problem is you can't use your phone while in this case. It covers the speaker so you can't hear. The case also makes it impossible for you to plug in your headphones while using. It is bulky and did not fit easily into the holster. I had the case for about 24 hours before returning.
best phone I ever owned easy to use easy to understand all features I love it!
Phone was a gift and recipient loves it. However she is already on her second one because the battery didn't last entire days before it was discharged. Today on the new phone had only 35% left after about 5 hours with little use -- No internet use and only a couple calls and some look-up of lists like to-do tasks and grocery list. Probably have to exchange it again. I heard that this is a common problem with the iPhone. Otherwise it has so many uses that everything you do can be in this one device in your pocket.
I am a big fan of Apple portable products. Great phone!
I PHONE 4S IS GREAT LOVE THE SERI. I-PHONES ARE FAR SUPERIOR TO ALL OTHERS AND MILES AHEAD AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE. BEST BUY OFFERED 230 DOLLAR GIFT CERTIFICATE FOR MY I PHONE ----WHICH I COULD USE FOR THE PURCHASE OF THE NEW PHONE WHICH COST 199 DOLLARS. THIS IN EFFECT PROVES THE VALUE OF A USED I PHONE. I CHOSE TO SELL IT ON EBAY AND GOT 350 DOLLARS FOR IT BECAUSE IT WAS IN PERFECT SHAPE SINCE I KEPT A CONVER ON IT AND A SHEER LAMINATED SCREEN PROTECTOR. CANT BEAT THAT!!!!!!!
Nice phone - Just plain works!! - Would purchase again!!
Amazing phone other than the battery runs down very quickly.
This phone is the best. iPhone can only get better
I had been debating on getting an iPhone for years and finally took the plunge and bought one for me and my wife. I can honestly say i don't know how i went this long without an iPhone. The Best Buy Mobile store was great to work with and answer all of my smartphone questions and got both phones setup in less than an hour and transferred all information from our old phones. My wife's phone had some problems the 1st week and wasn't able to make or receive phone calls - bad SIM card - but they were able to fix it quickly. I went back and forth between the $.99 3GS, the $100 4, and the $200 4s - i'm glad i bought the 4s. I needed a 4 or 4s b/c i wanted Facetime since i travel for work and have kids at home; Facetime is great.....wish i didn't have to have a wifi connection for it, but that makes sense. The 4s was worth the extra $100 for Siri and the phones ability to type text messages and other things just by talking and the other upgrades from the 4 - it's faster. The camera on the phone is great! i wish i would have known i was going to buy this phone a few months ago and i wouldn't have bought a new point and shoot camera b/c this thing is just as good. Great for taking pictures and videos of my kids. The iCloud service is also a big plus - backs up all my pictures, apps, and other phone information and the first 5GB is free. Overall, great phone and love how easy it is to use the app store and the overall use and functionality of the phone. My wife's not that tech savy - i still have to sync her ipod for her - and she is able to use this phone with no problem.
There is some disadvantages. But overall its a good device. Thank you!
Sure Siri is fun and useful for reading text while driving. I really don't use it as much as I thought. My spouse went with an HTC and I am really not sure I would not go that direction next time. We will see when the OSi 6 comes out this fall. Also Android market has a lot more free apps. I love face timing with my granddaughter!
I will never go back to a droid after having my iPhone!
Has everything I need in one package. I wish the battery lasted longer and had a smart memory...taking itself off charge when done charging. Oh...and would like to see a sd slot.
This is the best phone I have ever had! Love it! It's reliable, fast, easy to use, and smart (well, Siri isn't so smart). An awesome camera and video.
Super smartphone, best I've had compared to prior iphones and other smartphones previously. Better sound, picture and features.
I upgraded from the iPhone 4. Suri is great . Loving my phone.
Overall it is a great phone. I think my problem is more with the service than anything else. I would totally recommend the IPHONE 4, in white of course!
Greatest phone on the planet. Droids are light years behind this phone.
This is by far the best phone I've ever owned. It's really easy to use- I didn't even need the manual. I love the face time feature since my family lives 3000 miles away!! I also love how once I've logged into a wireless network, the next time I go back to that spot, the phone automatically rejoins that network.
Had this phone for a few weeks and sold it to a friend in favor of the Lumia 900. I need a phone that keeps me organized and this phone didn't seem to do the trick. This phone actually messed up my Outlook calendar. I would not recommend anyone use this phone for organizational purposes.
Its great and i love my phone.Features,App,Touchscreen
I have had the Iphone since they first came out and have had every model from that point on. I think Siri is hilarious and that alone was worth the upgrade.
Great size, weight is very minimal. All functions of the phone work greatly, from running apps to gaining access to the net. Camera features are easy, and downloading pictures and music are a snap. The only thing I really wish they would work on is the ability to upgrade the memory in the iPhone without having to upgrade the entire phone. Other than that, this really is an excellent smart phone.
Switched to the iPhone from an android, actually owned 3 androids prior. The iPhone is the smoothest running phone yet! No force closes with apps, works every time flawlessly. The battery life is amazing, all my droids killed the batteries so quickly. I could easily go 2 days without charging now. FaceTime is great and fun to use. Love the iCloud and auto backups. So many times before I had to reset my phones and lost everything. I couldn't be happier.
This new phone makes my wife so happy with all its' new apps and the Siri is great! She can talk her notes and make list while on the fly. How can you beat that. Easy to use. I started to take the new gallaxy 2 back and get another iphone, but I am good with this new skyrocket.
I would tell anyone that I just love this phone. Love the Siri function of this phone. Some of the things it comes up with puts a smile on your face.
This phone is awesome and I love it. Siri is awesome and is so cool.
I would not do without my iphone. Everything you could ever want.
I waited a long time to get this phone, and so happy I didnt wait any longer! It does everything I had expected from a smartphone.
I had the iPhone 4 previous and thought it was the best phone. Then came iPhone 4s and changed my mind. The best feature is Siri, she has helped me out so much. The colors are more vibrant and pop out at you on everything. I love how you can talk and look something up at the same time. Five Stars!!!
I have been a droid owner for years, HTC,HTC2, motorola. The htc is a good phone had no problems with it. The iPhone blows all of these out of the water. No problems with it at all. If you are thinking about an iPhone don't hesitate you won't be disappointed. It runs smoother than any droid phone out there and siri is amazing. P.S. goes great with my iMac. No problem with at&t service at all, coming from verizon i was a little surprised.
If you don't have one you wouldn't understand... hmmm seems that didn't qualify as a review. Maybe these extra words will help because that's all I have to say about it
Love my iPhone 4S. Does what it is supposed to do and Apple seems to keep up with new updates frequently. Apps are great and the most important thing, they can be trusted to do what they say.
Very pleased with my iphone 4S & very satisfied with the Customer Service with the purchase.
phone at this best buy selling to customer is no ggoooooddd at all...
The new Iphone 4s is the best phone I have ever owned! I switched from Android to the Iphone and I love the app store and the capabilites of the Iphone. The battery life is great. It lasts easily all day and if I don't play games for more than a couple hours I can make it last two days. The camera resolution is phenomenal and the HD screen is beautiful and exceptionally clear. I love how fast the phone is between switch apps and loading different programs or screens. I think I am an Iphone user for life!
this is an overall great buy for apple lovers. its easy to navigate with good options for professional and personal use. siri is a great concept but has trouble being used during road time because of network. or she says i cant understand you. this has been disappointing.
Few negatives: Can't have numerous aps open at once...on my old Palm, I could have many different things open at once. Sari doesn't always work The Iphone has not worked well with my 2012 My Touch...I get many complaints when I call people in the car Positives: Great App options When Sari works, it's great I like the Voicemail set up Easy to view and open my emails Great calendar features...I like that I can invite others to events Many great features to be honest...hard to list them all
It's an iPhone. It's got all the great features that iPhones have. But the battery just does not last. It takes one day for the battery to lose it's charge. I don't have too many apps installed, and I've only had it for a couple of weeks.
I love Seri and I was worried about not having a keyboard but with the auto correct and the talk texting feature it works out well. I love it. Don't like not having the normal smiley faces but when someone has an Iphone as well you can send emoticons... I am so happy I got this phone.
I bought this as an upgrade from a 3GS. The camera and speed are significantly better on the 4S. Siri is a definite plus. The speaker randomly has a crackling sound. From scouring the Internet, it looks like there isn't a fix. Since it's only randomly (and honestly, pretty quiet), I'm not going to attempt to send it in with the chance that I will get one that is worse. I was disappointed that the representative at Best Buy didn't tell me about the $36 AT&T upgrade fee. Since I wasn't charged it the day I bought the phone, I didn't realize I would have to pay it to AT&T later.
Great phone. This is my 3rd iPhone and it gets better every time! It does seem to have a shorter batter time than others.
Sweet! Got a Life Proof Case with it and it has help a lot!
I love the IPhone 4S, especially the multitude of functions.
I don't have a ton of apps added, but so far it's really fast to navigate around on the phone, pull up maps, browse the internet, etc. The picture quality is really clear. Face time works well. I've noticed when I dock it in my player for listening to music, that seems to mess up the network settings - easy to fix, but not ideal to have to fix it each time. The battery life also seems short, but I'm not sure if that's just because I'm using it more since it's so fast. =)
I bought this for the wife and couldn't be happier. She has MS and using Siri is a HUGE help to her. Sometimes she's too weak to do stuff and this is a second set of hands for her. We bought it a week ago and it already has 4G built in. It's not that fast as TV has lead us to believe but it's nice nevertheless. Super fast processor with a brillaint screen...Apple has done it again!!
I am overall happy with my new iPhone 4GS. I upgraded from the 3GS so I was already familiar with the phone itself. The speed is much faster and has some new features like Siri, which is very cool. I am still disappointed with the battery life. I usually charge it every day but it is worth it, it is a great product!
The thing I love most about the phone is the dual antenna; This feature gives you not only better coverage but maintains voice calls a lot better! Siri of course is always an added feature and with the new 5.1 update she's even more reliable.
iPhone is easy to use but it has a lot of bugs to work. I never had this trouble with my iPhone 3G
Great phone, love Siri, can't get enough of it!!! It's the coooooooooolest! Apple strikes again.
When i first got my Iphone 4s, I thought that it was going to be just like any other smart phone, not knowing about all the features the phone includes. As I turned on my iphone, the first thing that caught my eyes was the beautiful retina display. It looked HD and was stunning. As I scrolled through the organized main menu, I found some attractive apps. Apps such as Siri, texting HD camera really shocked me. The phone included many cool games also such as Temple Run, which was one of the best games I have ever played on a mobile phone. The value of this phone is phenomenal and should be worth a fortune. Thank you Apple for making this phone start at a price of $200. If I was the creator of the Iphone, I would've put a starting price of $500 or even more. It's the best phone in the world!!!!!
I am so glad I held onto my 3gs & missed the 4. This was so worth it!!
I have had this phone for a little over a month now and I absolutely love it! Traded up from an iPhone 3g and the speed difference is incredible. This phone is fast, easy to use, and SIRI has made my life easier :)
This phone is sleek and I would have to say my favorite. The signal is better than my other iPhones. The camera is good except for the flash gives red eye. Battery life is great!!! Other than that it's a good phone.
The iPhone 4S is an excellent product...high rez screen, quality camera, bluetooth, and a many quality apps available. I enjoy products that are well designed and work without issues. This iPhone was purchased for my wife, a very non-technical person - and what does she think about it ? She loves it! We've cancelled our landline now and are using only our iPhones. Another high point is the seamless integration between our Macbooks, iPad, and iPhone - everything works great together. By the way, if you have a mac or windows pc & iPad or iPhone, I would highly recommend an app called 1Password for password security/synchronization across all your devices.
i love everthing about the iphone 4s but the screen, if it had a screen the size of the htc evo , i would like it alot better. when i look things up on the internet it's hard to see the page and when i zoom in then it's too big for the screen. other then the size of the screen i love the way it works, i don't have any dropped calls or open any apps . the battery last a long time, i don't have to charge it everyday like i did my evo.
This is my first smartphone. Kelly, the BestBuy rep, recommended the iPhone because her parents found it easy to use. She was certainly right. Did not know how to delete apps so I asked Siri how to delete an app and she provided me with the instructions. Wanted the number of calories in a turkey/avocado sandwich. Siri gave me the information when I asked her. Also, using the iCloud to download pictures taken on my iPhone to my PC. No problems so far. Sending text messages is easy but I need more time to get accustomed to the keyboard. My fat fingers keep pressing the wrong key.
My personal opinion, iPhone is the best smartphone. iPhone 4S is much faster than 3GS. With Face Time app, you can do live video chat with other people on iPhone 4, 4S and iPad.
A good buy but the insurance here is pricey. Best Buy should consider giving a one time price for insurance as do its competitors.
several of my friends have the iphone. I kept reading up on it. Playing with my friends. I already had an ipod touch with a Ihome. So I decided on the iphone 4S. LOVE IT. I know there is so much more this phone can do that I haven't learned, or do not understand the lingo for it. Wishes there was a tutitorial for the phone. Would love an hour class or somehting. But I am loving it. and I see where someone who is a business owener could use this for everything. my only regret is maybe I should've waited for the iphone 5!!!!
I love my new iPhone the only thing I noticed was that Siri has difficulty understanding most of the things I say but I guess that will be improved. Other than that this phone is incredible.
Apple is at the top with iPhone 4s, no complaints at all with product.
I love my phone, this is my second iPhone and I would recommend an iPhone to any and everyone.
LOVE THE PHONE , COULD NOT IMAGINE BEING WITHOUT. KEEPS EVERYTHING ORGANIZED , VERY USER FRIENDLY
This phone is obviously nice. It's convenient and helpful, but it glitches so much. It constanty deletes my contacts, goes black for no reason, and a lot of my music doesn't work. I put it on my iphone from my ipod, and i had to put a lot of the music on twice because it wouldn't play. I don't know if my phone is just defective, but there are all kinds of glitches, and the battery isn't great. I have to charge it every night.
My first iPhone and it was definitely worth it. I got the regular 4 for christmas but wanted Siri so I upgraded to the 4S and haven't regretted it since. Excellent versitility and ease of use. The batter does run down much faster than I am use to but will still last all day. Only ran into one problem with Siri. I was trying to get her to send a text message and all she would say was "Something went wrong. Please try again later." I restarted the phone and everything was back to normal. I would definitely recommend this phone to anyone who wants to finally get an iPhone.
This is an excellent phone. I am glad I chose this to use for my business.
As a first time apple buyer I appreciate the security and consistancy the iphone promotes. Call quailty isn't as good as my blackberry was, but otherwise amazed with the functionality and seemlessness.
A clear improvement over the iphone 4 the 4s is everything I wanted a phone to be and don't forsee upgrading to anything anytime soon
Great item and great employees will come back when it's time for upgrade
Phone does not work in several locations around our home and Call quality not great. My daughter is in college and cannot get reception there with AT&T, so not happy with AT&T!!!!!! Overall like phone...service not so much!!!
The best part is being able to write text messages by talking to the phone. It is very accurate. It is easy to get to mail, Facebook, etc. If you own an iPad, you have almost nothing to learn.
The phone works, the camera works, the email works! It works
Have had the phone since Christmas and enjoy it for all the options that are on the phone!!!
I've had all the iphomes and this product just keeps getting better and better!
had the 3 and loved it so much then got the 4 did not like it at all traded for the 3gs and it was ok and now i have the 4s and I love it. This phne is so wonderful it does everything
This is a great phone; the only problem I am having is trying to text fast. It seems like all the other keys are pressed instead of the one I want. Also, I've had some issues with Siri saying foul language. However, it's not happening too often. All in all, it is very convenient to use and the pros over-power the cons.
I had a 3G Iphone prior to purchasing the new 4S, the updated features are so much better and it's much much quicker then the 3G. I'm on this thing 24/7!
would recommend to all my freind's and family and co-workers.
I never write reviews but felt like I should for this. I absolutely love this phone and it does everything. I mean everything. If you need a phone number for a pizza place for example, you dont have to search for the number because pick up your phone and ask it to and it will!! That is just the tip of the iceberg. I am a busy working mother of two and a college student again and with my busy schedule I don't know how I lived without this phone. I pay my bills, all my scheduling, play my games, and even get recipes for dinner right off my phone. I am not sure if I even use the phone/communication part of the phone more than the features it has. The camera on it is awesome and you can even switch the views.The battery is amazing and I never have to charge it like I did with every other phone. The phone is also super fast. I reccommend this phone to anyone and everyone! You won't be sorry.
I finally upgraded from my iPhone 3G-s, and man I am glad I did! The iPhone 4s feel so much more substantial and rugged in your hand, and everything about it is a total upgrade! The screen is remarkable, it is fast both on Wifi and cell data, Siri is helpful beyond compare, and who can beat the number and variety of apps available from the iTunes App Store?! Without a doubt, this is the phone to choose when upgrading or buying new! And I have had NO problems with my battery life! Just make sure you have iOS 5.0.1 or later!
so far,so good! nothing else to compare.friendly user and easy to handle!
I am not a power user but this phone runs flawlessly, interface is great, applications are awsome.
I can not even find anything bad with this phone. The camera is superb, SIRI works like a charm, and the phone is very fast. No problems at all. I am sure some have heard the bad press it has been getting about the battery, Never had a problem with the battery.
This is my 3rd iPhone. Wouldn't use any other. I have a lot of confidence in Apple products.
Apple is the best phone manufacturer in the world! This phone is great for pictures, video, calls (better antenna), web browsing, and all apps and utilities are much faster than previous models. I stopped using the map on my iphone 3g and this one is lightning-fast so I can use it again! Siri is an amazing tool that helps you maximize your phone's services. I use it to voice-text in the car. Love this phone and I'm an iphone customer for life!
I upgraded from the IPhone 3G and I love that the graphics are much improved. The picture is very clear and the photos come out much better. I don't like the life of the battery; you have to charge the phone daily if you use the internet or play games. I also don't like that sometimes if you use the flash, the photos comes out a little blurry. To me, Siri is no big deal; I rarely use. Other than that I love my phone but I could have saved $100 and just got the 4 rather than the 4S.
It's a all around good phone for the price video is good picture's are very good user friendly
Awesome phone easy to use. All the app choices are great. It's really fast and no need for a camera because the phone takes awesome pictures.
The Applie iPhone 4S is a good little device, despite what competitors might say. I love the fact that I could keep my old case and that the phone is still made with durable glass on both sides. I haven't noticed the battery issue mentioned by others, but then again I don't do a lot of video streaming and I charge midday every day. The only flaw I see is that Siri will still send an email or text message to someone while the phone is locked....not very good security from that aspect.
This is my 2nd iPhone and I am happy with it. I bought one for my son and husband and they love their's too.
This is an amazing phone released by Apple. I would say I am most pleased with the speed, improved camera and video. It is quite amazing and can directly compete with point and shoot cameras on the market. I dont use Siri that much but she is a great way to avoid texting while driving. Definitely a worthwhile investment.
I love my NEW iPhone. Its Awesome. I really don't see how they could make it any better than this.
I love my new iphone whats would i do without it. Siri is a great feature and i would hope they keep this up and improve it for iphone 5 when it comes out. i Also hope that the battery would last a bit longer wen apps and internet is being used.
Pre-ordered the 4S through Best Buy Mobile. Great service provided by BestBuy Mobile in Lafayette, LA...Thank You! The iPhone 4S is a great smartphone. I highly recommend this product to anyone looking at purchasing a smarphone. Siri brings the product to a whole new level...thanks Apple:).
was time for a upgrade and very pleased.. best buy was very helpful in my purchase .. much better than ATT!
iPhone 4S is the best yet! I had the 3GS and I love this phone! The screen is awesome (of course) and the phone is so easy to use. I don't use Siri much but I have used it to send text messages and to show to friends. If you are looking for a phone that works with apps that actually work, go iPhone...
I loved everything the phone came with. No problem with Siri and my accent. Only small issue is that not all pics I click with out much light turn out good.The flash is too bright or I need to hone my skills ;)
My four year old daughter is always asking if she can talk to my phone, siri is something else. I cant wait until they release the full version, from my understanding siri is still in beta testing. Besides the artificial intelligence the new iphone 4s is the most fun i have ever had with a phone. I went from an android samsung galaxy vibrant to iphone and am thrilled with the new found apple experience. (Although i am a lot slower at typing now as i did grow very accustmed to the swpe cabality of android.) It even convinced me to get an ipad for christmas. As far as the icloud stuff i misplaced my phone on laundry day and was able to locate it with my brothers iphone. What a wonderful feature and great piece of mind. I love the clarity and amazing screen we love watching youtube and hulu in the car! As far as the problems people have had with battery life and dropped calls from the previous model i have not experienced any of those, i do however always update it so i have heard that will help those who have had problems. The best feature is the mobile hotspot capability, with at&t my phone turns into a wifi device that my laptop can connect to, although the integration for the ipad makes the perfect combination of 2 devices working great together. With the hotspot on your phone it makes any wifi ipad like a 3g one without the extra cost or need of an extra data plan! All in all a great phone that also has lots of learning aps and capabilities for my daughter. I would highly recommend the new iphone 4s!
i love the phone and its easy to use just like any thing that apple makes.
It's a great smartphone. Much faster and the camera is great with 8mb. Siri is also great but kind a having a hard time understanding what I'm saying needs to more clearer but it works great specially when I'm driving.
I was so excited to get this new phone. I preordered and got it the first day it came out. I love all Apple products. I never even considered the possibility this phone wouldn't be amazing. The first day I got it I spent hours playing with Siri. Siri is fun and helpful yet far from perfect. Still, it is impressive. I was hopeful there would be bigger changes, but really Siri is the only impressive thing about this phone. Thats the sole reason i gave this two stars instead of one. But even Siri isn't enough to make me recommend the new 4S. I lose no joke 1% of battery life each minute I use the phone. And yes, I've updated to the new iOS 5.0.1 that's supposed to correct this problem, but it's actually made it worse. If I make the mistake of charging the phone and unplugging it before I go to bed I find it loses 20% in 7 hours of doing nothing! I had to buy a car charger because I can't even get through an entire morning without needing a charge. I cannot recommend this phone at this time. I would wait a few months and see if Apple will fix this problem since the new update did not.
Amazing as all the other iPhones so far and the fact that they have Siri, just makes this that much more exciting to own.
My first Apple purchase, why did I wait so long? Great product for my first smart phone. Very intuitive and well made. I may not have to upgrade to the iPhone5.
This phone does everything it claims. Much faster than my 3GS and Siri is amazing.
Siri is great fun. I bought this just for the new features but the main highlight is iOS5 which you can get with an iphone 4 as well.
Well, this review is for the people that have never owned one and were considering it. I have had a new Andriod based phone since they came out. I loved the OS and I liked the set-up. However, it really just can't compare to the Apple experience. I had my ipod... bought a Macbook... then it all came together with the iphone. Yes, I 100% agree that the specs don't match up with the best of the Android phones. However, what sold me was that they don't change like the Andriod phones do. That was a huge selling point. If you buy an iphone - you are able to do all of the things every other iphone user can do. With Andriod phones, mine was the best of the best... for about a month. My wife's phone was 1 year old and could not even get the upgrade to the OS to get any new apps. She essentially had a dead phone after a year. From there is was easy. I was able to just set it up through my Apple account and it all flowed together. With the cloud feature, app store and all of the things Apple seems to do right - I just cannot see myself switching back to any other type of phone.
They keep coming out with the best products on the market. A huge step from the Iphone 4.
IPHONE IS JUST KILLING THE COMPETION ITS CALLED ANDROID KILLER IPHONES 4S HANDS DOWN BEATS ANY PHONE AND ATT ROCKS THATS ALL I HAVE TO SAY
I've had the 3G, the 3GS and now the 4S. The 4S is clearly faster, the camera is better than my stand alone camera, and Siri is addictive. If you are up for an upgrade get the 4S for sure you won't regret it.
the iphone 4s in at&t 16 is awsome the best one ever. my only concern is that i have the 3g and my wifi on but it keeps saying that it can not connect to the internet, hopfully it will work later on.
Absolutely love my Iphone over my previous phone (Samsung Galaxy 1)
I waited a long time for an iPhone, and I love it.
I use my iphone as my computer. It is the best phone i ever had. I love that I can see it out side. I will not upgrade unless there is a feature on the new one that i really want. I love how i can use my gift cards from my ipod on my iphone and all the apps and music i have already. I love how can use use them. Before I got my iphone i was going to get an android phone but I said then I can't use my gift cards ,apps and music that i have. Best phone ever!!!!!
Bought this phone for my wife, The Iphone the super smart phone nuff said
This phone is easy and fun to operate no matter what age you are. There is so much you can do with the iphone and the apps are endless.
I really love this phone. I have had no problems with it at all except for that when Im writing a text message you can touch a letter a million times and it wont type it. Its like it locks up on that one letter for a minute. Other than that, I have had no problems. I have amazing service with it now than I did with my other phone. I have 4G everywhere!
Great phone with iCloud. The battery does not last long at all.
I've waited a long time to get an iPhone, even though we have used Mac computers for several years. Well worth waiting for. Love it!!
Like the phone, am having trouble since I did the IOS 6 update - seem to drop more calls.
Switched from a 3gs to a 4S. I got my 3 gs in Jan 2010, and never had the need to change it. It eventually wore out (battery), and I had no need to get a different type of phone, since the Iphone has everything I need in a phone.
Excellent phone overall. Very easy and intuitive to use.
Would recommend this phone to anyone that uses their phone for everything because this has it all.
I love Apple products. It's the easiest phone to use and connects all my other Apple products together. I just love it!!
I personally love my iPhone 4s. I like all the features and the fact that it is easy to use. It's not too big nor too small.
My son kept telling me to get an IPHONE and i kept putting it off....oh i wish i hadn't. I am loving this phone. Still figuring out ways to make my life easier with it!
Very nice phone with Siri to use as your personal assistant. IOS 6 is available for it now which makes it run as good as the new 5. I bought this instead of the 5 because I'd rather let Apple clear all the bugs out of the 5 before I get it.
Good phone, cost is a little high and if you don't have a service plan you are screwed
I've always liked OtterBox commuter cases for how small and compact they are while still staying with the OtterBox commitment to rugged protection so when upgrading my phone to a new Apple Iphone a commuter case was my first choice but I was very sad when I received my case in the mail. On the website the Teal case was a really cool greenish-blue, borderline forest green color but in real life when I opened my package I almost thought I had received the wrong case. It is a very light sky blue color not the darker green I thought I was receiving.
Thankfully I haven't had to test how well it holds up when the phone has a hard drop as of yet. I liked the fact it had two layers of protection however I wish it covered the front of the phone like the defender series but without the bulk. One thing I noticed the hard plastic outside cover is a bit distorted, there's a gap between the hard plastic and the rubber coverings. I bought the pink and white case first and kept the least distorted one of the two. After a while the gap between the hard plastic and soft rubber has lessened. Also the rubber has a tendacy to transfer the dye of your jeans or the inside of your purse. You have to press the power button firmly to turn it off, which isn't a problem for me but could be for others. The earbud and the usb ports are protected well.
I love this case! It looks amazing on my white iPhone. The only downside is the screen protector that it comes with is garbage... buy a Zagg shield instead.
I purchased this to hear radio broadcasts and not bother anyone else.
"I really liked this i phone case" I whish they could make it a bit lighter. I also have to be very careful to avoid scratches. But overall it looks nice and I like the fact that i don't have to worry about charging it through the day. Very Practical.
Uses it own charger, not apples. you need to remove it to use the apple charger
Great case! Does add a little bit of size to the phone, but if you are a heavy user than this is what you need. Case will recharge batter from 20% to 90% if case is fully charged.
I love it! I kick in a charge whenever I need it to make it through a day out the office.
Bought this with my phone because I heard of the issues with battery life. My phone battery really hasn't been much of a problem but it has come in handy a few times when I forgot to recharge the battery at night and ran out during the day. It also is a really good protective cover for the phone. My only complaint is that it is a little heavy and large. Makes putting the phone in your pocket harder. If you have battery issues though, this is the way to go.
I would recommend the Mophie case to anyone who has ever been annoyed with the batter life of smartphones. I am a heavy usage iPhone guy. With this case my iPhone can make it through a day and a half without charging. Before I would always have to worry about having access to an outlet and carrying around my charger with me. Now I just charge the case overnight and it lasts forever. It is great when going camping or to sports events when an outlet is not available. It is not bulky at all, looks attractive and fits perfectly on the phone. Anyone who is concerned about battery life should buy this product. It is a must have.
I like a lot this case. its the best case i ever have. I recommend you to buy this its good investment for your iPhone 4 battery.
Case did not fit well on iphone. Always falling off. Needs redesign. Returned product after a few days.
My Husband and I purchased this product for a 9 hour flight (red for him, white for me). It gave both of our phones double the battery life which was great for an iPhone 4!!! It's extremely easy to use, fits the phone perfectly and looks very nice. There is an indicator button on the bottom which you press, and you will see how much battery life is left in the cover. Should your iPhone need a little or a lot of charge - just flip the switch and the charging begins! The ONLY issue I have had is the paint is chipping off of the front edges of the white cover (and I am not hard on my phone at all). I have had the cover for less than 30 days.
It's light weight, fits phone perfectly, keeps the charge for a long time. Doubles the life of my iphone. It's easy to turn off and on to use when necessary. I like the button at the bottom to notify me of the amount of juice I have available. It doesn't add too much bulk to my phone like some other phone cases. You can choose between 1500 mgh or 2000 mgh. The price of 79.99 is fairly affordable. I haven't found anything I dislike about it. It came in handy when I needed it to so in my opinion it's a winner.
This is the 3rd Mophie Juice Pack we have in our family. All meet the expectation of that the device is designed to do. It does add a little weight and bulk but nobody seems to mind (including wife and daughter). Just have to be mindful of when connecting it to the USB cable - don't go jamming it in!
I bought this item becuase as you know, if you use you iPhone for work it doesn't make it through the day. As soon as I put the new case on the phone slipped out of my hand. It makes the phone larger which i don't like. I keep my phone in my pocket and this case made it large and akward while walking and for getting in and out of my pocket quickly when I had a phone call. It might work better for ladies with a purse or men with a murse (I'm not judging you). After a single day of use all the crevices caused by the case had already started to accumulate grime and debris. This case wasn't for me but different people have different needs so give it a try I you don't mind the bulk and need the extra battery life.
I just picked up this case last night. Very different than your usual case in that it is textured. I do like the color, but it is not as pictured online. Online it says it is blue/purple, definitely not though.
I don't remember how long I have had this case on my iPhone 4S, but I can't complain. I have dropped this poor phone more then I think I have dropped all other cell phones I have owned in my life combined. This includes numerous drops down the steps, meaning top step all the way to the floor below (never happened until all the carpet in the house had been replaced with hard wood floors). The case has held up perfectly, and more importantly, has kept my phone in one piece without a single scratch to show. The description here says purple/blue (which doesn't match the picture even), the case is a dark teal. The case is hard, and has a somewhat interesting texture on the back, but while being interesting I can't say it ever bothered me. I have most definitely put this case through its paces, it may be a little dirty, but it has done EXACTLY what I bought it for...protect my iPhone :)
This case protects the very expensive iPhone and works great!
I had the previous Defender case with the iPhone 4. I now have this one, for the 4S and both are great cases. Yes they are a bit pricey but way better than paying to get you iPhone fixed or for a brand new one. I work in a warehouse and my phone sees a ton of harm but this seriously saves it every time. I have dropped it, thrown it at walls, and even kicked it. My co-workers see how indestructible it is and will now just smack it out of my hands because they know nothing will happen. It also has a built in screen protector. I have had no issues with this case at all. Don't even hesitate buying, just save your iPhone and get one of these.
We had really old phones prior to purchasing these phones. I was a little scared of getting a smartphone, but knew I would need to sooner or later. The phone was so easy to figure out! I love it. I love that I can get internet on it and I don't even turn on my computer everyday like I used to because I can do so much on this phone. We've been having some problems with syncing and figuring that out, but other than that, we both love our new phones!
I still have a lot to learn about this phone (reason I bought my 17 year old one also) but so far it has worked great. I have had it lock up one time but it is just like a computer, turned it off and then back on and it went on working fine.
like all my apple products, i love this device! however, the price is pretty steep. at&t needs to up the bar on the reception in the northeast!!! NOT APPLES FAULT! although i love my phone, i find myself asking why do i not have 4g? of well, maybe the iphone 5 will have it? still, i do love my phone and would have a very hard time living without it!
Upgraded to iPhone 4 on recommendation from some of the "kids" I work with......I found it very easy to use and physical features very appealing. However, when at work on job sites licated in fringe areas I have absolutely NO coverage while standing 5 feet away from colleagues who have 3 or more bars on thier Motorola phones (with the same carrier- AT&T). Software is idiot proof if you liike to be joined at the hip to iTunes. Lack of flexibility in removing unwanted applications like the stock ticker. Otherwise no complaints.
I like it ease to use, clear picture,good sound,great camera and video
I love this iPhone so much that I bought another one in white
As advertised. Best phone available! Can't wait for the Iphone 5!
The phone is great but I was a little disappointed with the service when I was out of the country. My brand new 4G phone which is also a mobile hotspot could not get service in Colombia, South America. Yet everyone else had no problem getting service.
Just simply the best on the market. Lives up to th hype. I have not had any problems right out of the box
Great phone in addition to being a portable computer. I can do everything from this piece of technology. It makes travel easy as I do not have to always carry a notebook or even the ipad...everything all in one!
I had to get the 4 after having the 3GS fall and get destroyed. I wanted to wait for the 5, but wasn't mad I had to get the 4. It's even way better than I thought it would be, and the only reason I'd upgrade to the 5 is if it's head and shoulders above the 4. Amazing phone...can't wait for iOS5!
Great on the go. Serves the purpose when WiFi is not available and you need to access the internet in a pinch. Very versitile. Very simple. Can be as simple or as complicated as you want it to be.
Although I needed to get a bumper for the phone to mitigate the dropped call problem, I love this phone.
easy to use and operate. The easiest, and simplest interface on the market
I am disappoint with the battery , it last less than a day with light use and it is worse when I have to carry the phone in the area which has no signal, It quite a shame to see a iphone user alway have to bring the battery changer everywhere I go , some applications may interact with the os make the phone very slow respond! even though I did upgrade the to 4.3 OS ,ATT service signal is very poor, drop calls are the another feature I endure! : ( the next 2 years in the contract with ATT would not make me happy at all+ all the charge! 15 $ data plan with 200 mb is a joke nothing you can do with it , even I have to be very careful with the mail checking, U will be bill for a little extra usage! watch out!
higher end functionality have been incorporated in a user friendly manner
After deciding it was time to upgrade from my iPhone 3G, I was initially attracted to an Android phone. I liked the ability to customize the user interface and some of the features (GPS, battery life, etc). Torn between the Android phone and the iPhone, I went for the Android phone. After having the phone and trying it out for about 2 weeks, I decided to return the phone. My trial with the Captivate made me appreciate the iPhone and how well and easily it worked. I returned the phone for a iPhone 4. Although it is more expensive, I chose the 32GB and now have more than enough space for my MP3s/pictures and really enjoy the phone. The processor is much faster than the 3G. iTunes has applications for everything you could think of/need. I can wake up in the morning, check the weather, email, sports and sports updates within 5 mins. I highly recommend the iPhone. Little to no maintenance is needed to maximize the efficiency of the phone and battery life. It just works, and works well, right out of the box. I liked the effortless ability to work well and the extras that I have recently purchased my first Mac Pro. I hope that will work as well and effortlessly.
This is very precise when it comes to the GPS... excellent locator of addresses. I bought this for this reason and it does exactly what it says. Other features work wonderful, program weather anywhere and it comes up perfect everytime. Only thing I wish it would have would have a choice if I want to list my "names" by first name. You can only put them in with last name first, although you can put the first and last together in the "name" entry, so when you search for name the first name comes up quickly, otherwise, very fast and pictures and video camera are EXCELLENT. Very happy with my purchase. Plays games quickly. you do have to dim the light on this phone cause it will use up your battery pretty quickly.
I was with Sprint for nearly 12 years. I was tired of their tired handset line up. Now they have gotten better with the addition of the EVO, but I just figured it was time for a switch. Naturally, the iPhone had grabbed my attention.I started with an iPhone 3GS and was hooked on all things Apple. Last June I switched to the iPhone 4 and I've gotta say... this thing just works well. It makes sense in the way it operates. I LOVE IT! I will never move to another phone maker. Apple does products well. Forever Apple!
purchased the phone with out service,to use internationally and the locked phone is not usable.
Screen resolution is incredible...best iPhone yet!
I used a blackberry for years and really liked it and then I lost my phone, so I decided to try out the iPhone. Yeah, I just love it! Its so easy to use. The phone just makes sense and it's fun! I love having a new gadget! Oh yeah. The kids love it too. The phone and some of it's cool apps have made it possible to go out to dinner and enjoy it. It keeps the little ones busy!
What's not to like, it put's my old Droid to shame when it comes to battery life. Games are more realistic and apps are easier to use.
The battery life is very short, and some Blue tooth devices does not work well with it.
I have never had a problem with something from Apple. I am a PC person, but Apple is a good company also.
Okay so today i got to experience the iphone everyone is talking about. Don't fall into the trap people, it is far from the greatest phone ever. It feels like a toy if you have ever used something like a Android Phone. I have the Samsung Epic 4g and i tell you it is a amazing phone and out shines the iphone any day. When i use the iphone i feel like ii am in the grid selection on my phone to choose a app. There is NO HOMESCREEN ON THIS PHONE. There is NO LEVEL OF CUSTOMIZATION. You would think that all this is at a cost for performance but u would be wrong again, my phone was usually faster at opening apps, looking better, and has a better overall feel. Take what you want with this information, however i would look into some of the new android phones cause they are really looking better than what apple has to offer
Great phone! Awesome apps! FaceTime is cool! The ability to do iMovie and gps!
Upgraded from the iPhone 3G when it finally died due to toddler handling and abuse. I was a great phone and lasted me a little over 3 years which was the longest a phone has ever lasted me. Now this new iPhone 4 is lightyears faster than my old 3G and I couldn't be happier. Plus all the features such as facetime and the ability to record video without having to buy an add on app. I love the fact that it also has a led light for picture taking. Overall, this is a great phone
Waited a while to review the iPhone4, just to make sure I still liked it as much as when first purchased. It is simply a great phone, great for business. Many useful features including e-mail and text capabilities. That is probably the iPhones' biggest strength, it is very quick updating both e-mail and texts. Another feature is the camera and video resolution, very crisp and clear, a tremendous asset for many business tasks. Web surfing works descent and the many mapping apps are very cool to use. Screen resolution is excellent. Could always use more battery life. On heavy usage days phone needs charging by mid afternoon. Considering all what the phone is used for, that is a minor complaint. AT&T is adequate in Chicago and most major metro areas, except perhaps sections of LA County (where iPhone saturation happened many years ago - no way to add more towers?). I know many people pan the the ability to check e-mail while talking to a client, but in my business, that is more than just a cool feature. Due to this, likely would stick with AT&T over Verizon when it's time to get a new one. The previous iPhone3G was hammered into submission, fortunately it lasted till the 4 was available under full discount. Considering the days of the brick phone with 2 hour battery talk time and the mandatory one year replacement cycle, the iPhones are pretty durable. Get the screen shield and have Best Buy install it. When it gets damaged and Zagg sends you a new one, they install the replacement shield for free. Definitely worth it.
I upgraded from the 3G and haven't looked back. All of the advertised features in the new iPhone have held up to the hype. Facetime is awesome except for the lack of 3G functionality, the extended battery life has been greatly noticed, the processor speed is a vast improvement, multi-tasking makes navigating the phone and completing tasks much easier, and the extended customizability options have added plenty of reasons to upgrade to the new phone.
Great phone, and Great price, what more can you ask for. Definite reason to go to Best Buy!
by far this phone is the best on the market. the only draw back is the service. at&t I am really surprised they are still in business I have had several drop calls on this phone and have contacted at&t customer service about it (out of 5 stars I would not give their customer service even a quarter of a star). they were no help and kept making up excuses on what the problem was and they just argued with me and just side stepped the problem and still I have this issue. BUT THANK GOD THAT AT&T IS NOT THE ONLY CARRIER FOR THIS PHONE NOW THAT VERIZON IS NOW A OPTION FOR PHONE SERVICE FOR THE APPLE I PHONE 4. I am defenatly going to drop my AT&T service and change over to verizon now that my contract is done with AT&T. Verizons service is 1000 times better than AT&T and also verizons customer service is top notch and they fix the problem but I totally recommend this I phone to anyone looking to buy one. I totally recommend though if you are going to get this phone get the service with verizon NOT AT&T. I wish you could of gotten service with verizon when this phone 1st came out.
I'm not an Apple fanboy but I have owned the original 2G, the 3G, the 3GS and now the iPhone4. I have owned it for over a month now and couldn't part with it. It seems odd to talk about the aesthetics of a phone but the screen resolution is incredible and it feels balanced and sturdy when you hold it. I haven't had any issues with the antenna - the only reception problems I have had are just related to the one dead-zone near where I live. It's also noticeably faster than the 3GS and it supports wireless-N networks. Battery life is improved over the 3G/3GS but you'll still want to re-charge it nightly. The big issue I have is that I'm afraid to get it scratched but I highly recommend Powersupport's Combo Film Set for the iPhone4 which covers both the front and back. Facetime looks cool but I don't know too many people that have an iPhone to actually use it.
I traded up from the 3GS and I have no regrets. All the discussions about poor signal strength is highly exagerated. I put the phone in an Otterbox case and it works just fine. I cant wait to see what apple comes up with next.
I got my iphone4 at best buy last nov 2010 and I can say that Im sooo loving it!!!! I highly recommend this to everyone!! Its an all in one gadget that you would definitely be very amazed in using. It has lots of great features cool apps you will be so addicted to it!!! Its very handy and light too ! Very awesome phone!!!! I can keep this as long as I can !!!
I had a iPhone since the original iPhone and have used all of them, but this model has a great screen resolution, battery life, high-quality 5.0-megapixel digital camera with built-in LED flash, HD video with audio and Wi-Fi video calling. I love it. Remember to get apple care and MobileMe from apple with your iphone.
The phone is amazing, the HD display is beautiful, the OS is perfect, apple makes amazing toys, the new iPhone is the best phone on the market
This has got to be the best phone I have ever had,and I've had alot.The service AT&T has given,has been great.Never lost a call yet,and the phone is easy to use.
This is a great phone, i upgraded from an iPhone 3GS and it is faster, the screen resolution is amazing, and it takes great pictures and video. The LED flash is also a plus!
I love my Iphone but it could be better!! Well I mean they could of have made facetime work with data too!! Once u start using the apps it just drains ur life on the battery!!Those are my main concerns but everything else isgreat!!
This phone is the best phone I have ever owned. The ease of use, the Apps, and the overall function of the iPhone 4 is spectacular.
The more I learn about this iPhone the more I fall in love. It is AMAZING!!!!!
I love the iPhone. This purchase was an upgrade from the iPhone 3G. Initially I was skeptical about whether it was worth the money for the features to upgrade. I am pleased to say YES! I love facetalk as well as tango! I also love the dual camera, camcorder and faster speed of the phone overall. I am so glad that I decided to upgrade!!
This is my second iPhone. A very useful business tool. Lots of data available and apps to use it.
Phone stops working at 0 degree C which is not good.
What can I say? I've had every iPhone so far and they just keep getting better! Love, love, love! I can't live without it!
I purchased this as a Christmas gift for my wife. It was probably the gift she has thanked me for the most of all the gifts I purchased over the past five years. She absolutely loves it. It is an adventure see what else it can do. In a sense it replaces her old Razor phone, her old point and shoot camera, and our video camcorder and provides an increasing number of other features as she downloads various APPS. The phone size is a bit large for me. However, It is perfect for my wife who can keep it in her purse.
Well, with all the hype & claims of dropped calls I waited a extra 6 months to switch from the 3G model just to see what gets fixed or done but finally gave in. Got the phone & couldn't be happier, never drop calls the camera is amazing, 720p HD video & pics get so many compliments a sweet phone 32 gigs is great, multitasking is easy & not demanding on the A4 chip, battery last 2-3 days with constant use.. Recommended to anyone needing a smart. Phone or upgrade.
iPhone 4 is a well-functioning phone, with the proper case. It has a much better battery life than the 3GS, but this was a low bar. Screen is clearer, processor functions very well, and reception is a bit better that the 3GS. I thought the 3GS rounded shape was actually sleeker and fit in the hand better, but nonetheless I find the 4 more useful because of the better camera, 2nd camera, and battery life. Would have like tethering, but ATT wouldn't let me keep the unlimited plan and tether it.
Apple updates the operating system and makes it like getting a new phone. Many apps to download from iTunes. Doesn't need an instruction manual! Wow, now that tells you it is intuitive.
Had iPhone 3G before this one. 4g moves much faster.
I've owned every iPhone and this has been the biggest and best update since the original. The HDR photos with the camera are really good quality for a cell phone. The Retina display is amazing too. The only disappointment was not offering a 64gb version like iPad and iPod touch, would have gladly paid another $100 for the extra storage...
Getting old means needing reading glasses. With the iPhone4 I find I can see most of what I do without the glasses. The higher resolution screen really makes a difference. I do like the flash with the camera and that I can turn it off if I need to. It's slimmer and easier to hold. The one problem is if you drop it, like a friend did recently the glass on both side shatter. It wasn't pretty.
as with many users the intrigue of Apple introducing a phone was more than most could handle. The Apple 3G grabbed my attention and i began looking at the product with more intent to buy, and then 3Gs which built upon the already incredible platform that Apple provided- Yet I did not buy! After the hype had settled down Apple hit the market again with the 4 and now it was time to buy. Being in the market for a new iPod as well as a Phone i knew that the iPhone for was it. This phone has either met or exceeded all expectations. Fast reliable interface, with an incredible display that apple has been known for. I have not had any problems with this product and seems to be far more durable than any of the predicessors. Apple has jampacked this phone with features and capabilities that are at the forefront of technology. If you're looking for a new phone this is quite the product- successful in all its attempts to merge power and functionality into one sleek handheald device.
Replaced m 3G with the 4. Mistake! Worst battery life of any phone I've ever had, and this is my second one (replacement). Need to charge twice a day, even with minimal usage and using all of the tricks to reduce battery use. Better reception with the 3G. The 4 has even been dropping calls, not ringing through, etc. Haven't had these issues in YEARS!! Not nearly as good as a Droid.
Awesome phone, both my husband and I purchased this phone and we both love it. Easy to use, upload music and pictures get 32 GB they really come in handy.
I LOVE THIS PHONE!!!!! I love that I can talk and surf at the same time on the AT&T network. Call clarity is great and dropped calls are very few. The endless variety of apps available in the app store are incredible. The mapping and GPS capabilities of this phone have been flawless. I have really enjoyed the Groundspeak Geocaching app, which is basically like a GPS based scavenger hunt. The iPhone4 has been amazingly accurate with the GPS coordinates.
It has everything I need to keep abreast of daily events and family members. I enjoy the apps available for use. There are new apps all the time. The 32GB memory available expands my use of the iphone 4 for additional app useage
I've had my iPhone for 2 weeks now and I'm beyond impressed at what it can do. I upgraded from my old 3G that had served me faithfully for 2.5 years and it was well worth the wait. The 4 runs incredibly fast when it comes to internet and apps making my 3G feel like a brick. The Retina screen does not disappoint as it makes everything pop off the screen. The only pitfall of this phone is the antenna placement. If you hold it in your left had with the so called "death grip", you will kill the signal and drop calls. I put an Otter Box Defender case on it and problem solved!!
Not have a smart phone before the cell reception was not the best in Colonial Beach, VA. Now with the iphone 4 so far I have not had a drop call or lost of network. Don't know if this would have happen with any smart phone but it did work with the iphone. So nice.
Have really enjoyed it - have had no problems despite some of the early gripes about the reception!
If you love iPhones, then you will get one, regardless of what is said here LOL. I upgraded at full price to iphone 4 ($799) and passed 3GS down to hubby. The retina display is amazing - however, the battery life is not much better. My gripes are never with the phone (always wonderful) but with AT&T's restrictive service, outrageous traveling rates and cutting out the unlimited data for new customers (I am grandfathered in). If T-Mobile would have gotten the iphone (or had Droid been around) i never would have gone to AT&T - but i wanted an iphone, so had to go. Now Verizon is offering it, and possibly with unlimited data (AND ITS A MOBILE HOTSPOT!!) so yes, still not happy with AT&T for $130 per month, but i love my iphone!
The phone must be awesome because my little lambs are not complaining and they use these Smart Phones so much I am sure it is making them stupid. Nice product.
I love my new iPhone but more importantly the only place I'd buy an iPhone is Best Buy. Their Geek Squad Black Tie protection is unparalleled. I wouldn't dream of buying my iPhones anywhere else.
The battery life on my iPhone 4 far exceeds my 3GS. I can make it a solid three days before charging with standard usage.
The phone is great. It does so many things. Love the built in maps/directions...plus, I get a discount working at a school so my bill is less than $100 a month.
Okay, we are all sick of hearing about the iPhone. I would have bought one sooner, but I HATE AT&T!!! I finally gave up T-Mobile to upgrade. I love that you can do everything under the sun from this device. I had a Blackberry Curve and there are limits. With the App Store, you truly can find an "app for that". The phone is pricey and if you drop it, well you are out of luck and looking at a new one, but if you are careful and buy a good case, you are golden. Battery life is very bad! It is due to the playing that you will do on it. Surfing the web, watching videos, playing with apps all suck battery life. Just charge at night when you get home. I highly recommend the upgrade from whatever phone you have now to the iPhone. You will not be sorry. Play with a friend's first. Perhaps try an iTouch for a bit. You will know what you have been sort of missing.
This phone is amazing. I upgraded to it from the iPhone 3G due to how slow my old one was getting and it's speed and hardware quality don't even compare. I also tried the Samsung Captivate before the 4 and it quit working after 24 hours.... wasn't too happy. So I switched back to my iPhone and now I couldn't be happier with a phone.
Nice phone... the battery seems to run out fast. nice picture pretty easy to use..
very good, I like iphone4. in future I will purchase more
It is very easy to use, and the colors are fantastic. Is lighter than IPhone 3 and easier to put in your pocket.
The iPhone4 is the greatest. The videos are excellent, the retina display is unbelievable. Would recommend this phone to everyone.
it is just such an intuitive phone to use. i had a 3g before this one. i tried a nokia and a blackberry before deciding to go back to an iphone. this lil puppy replaced my 6 year old laptop. nice
I just got the 32 GB I Phone 4 today so this is a preliminary review. I felt for the 100 dollars more I would double the memory on the phone. So far it is awesome. The audio clarity is excellent and the screen is simply brilliant. I was looking at The Samsung Capivate which is also a cool phone. I liked the speech recognition for texting on the Samsung but the I Phone has GPS and the MAP feature is by far my useful to me right now. I would love to have both. I did have one drop call but I had that on my previous phone which was a Samsung. I used the phone a lot today and no other problems with reception or more than the one dropped call. The speaker on the phone is very loud, and that is awesome too. My son just got a new I Phone yesterday and I look forward to a video chatting with him. I picked up a clear case for the phone so it doesn' t hide it' s beauty and sleekness. It was a breeze connecting to the bluetooth in my car. I have an IPOD dock in my car so again that was another plus for the I Phone. The phone is very fast, connecting to the web, Facebook, etc. As long as the phone performs well I will keep it. I took out the protection plan which is 15 dollars a month but I might cancel it because Apple offers a 2 year protection plan for 69 dollars. It might not cover for accidental damages which Best But does. I have to think about that. I started using the phone in the store and I fell in love with it. I think the phone is a little pricey but I still went for it. Of course, you are bound to Apple which with a Samsung you are not but with thousands of great apps it should not be a problem. Many are free, too. The design of the phone blows the competition away. It has a 5 MP camera with flash and high definition video recording. I highly recommend the phone right now. I will add to this review if I decide to return the phone but right now I am very satisfied with the phone. It is my new best friend !
Great platform (iPhone OS) and best available apps but AT&T's service is horrible. Also noticable is the less than stellar audio quality of the 4. My 3GS was waaaaayyyy better. Slight difference in speed of app loading does not make up for continued dropped calls and tin can sound. After being an avid Apple user for over 25 years (my first Apple was a 128) I am dissapointed at their hasty release of a would-have-been-near-perfect device especially coming from a company that prided themselves as the media computer leader. Tsk, Tsk.
The iPhone has everything ... and everything works like it is supposed to. I've been a Mac user since the mid-80s and consider myself pro-Apple, so this review may be a little biased. My only complaint is the costs involved. My experience with Apple products has been that they are all top notch and reliable. I looked at buying a less expensive phone, but just couldn't find anything that came close to what I wanted. I kept thinking if I want something that works like an iPhone, get an iPhone. I did and have not had any regrets. If you are looking for something "like" an iPhone, go ahead and get the iPhone.
This was my first iPhone and I never realized how much this device would change my life. Previously, I had owned a Blackberry and enjoyed being able to get my email and such on the go. However, the iPhone takes things to a whole new level. The retina display is absolutely wonderful - the text is sharp and crisp. Even when comparing this phone against more recent android phones with larger screens, the Apple display is just more readable and vibrant. The apps that are available are amazing and for the most part are very simple to use. The Nike app keeps track of my walks and runs. Podcaster lets me listen to podcasts during my workouts. Netflix lets me watch movies and tv shows in my queue anywhere. Goodreader lets me take important PDFs with me. Facebook lets me keep up with friends and relatives. Flashlight lets me get around in the dark. The games like Angry Birds, Cut The Rope and the many driving games provide a lot of entertainment. The camera is really good. I'm glad Apple concentrated on better quality than getting into the 'mega-pixel' game of having to have the most mega-pixels. Even the video comes out well. Having a unified email inbox is great. I can quickly look at email across multiple accounts with ease. The battery life is better than on my blackberry but given that this is a smart phone that you'll use a lot, be prepared to charge it at least every one to two days. Downsides? I would like AT&T to offer more bandwidth for less money. The $ 15 plan is not enough for me and I really like to see an increase in data allowances for all of their pricing tiers. The apps offer so much flexibility but some are really crippled if you're trying to control your bandwidth costs. I would like to see 5 GB at $ 25 and 2 GB at $ 15.
I am a iPhone convert from htc & samsung phones. iPhone is in a class by itself. Delayed switching due to AT& T reviews by friends and consumer reports. After 1 month, no problem. My wife still has Sprint. Daughters have T-Mobile and Verizon. I haven't had any dropped calls from Nashville to the Georgia coast. They have. I have had iTouch for 2 years. Don't need it any more. Plan on converting whole family to iPhone at Christmas. Wife and daughters ready to leave the android service now but I'm gonna make them wait. Will make it more exciting when I do convert them. Way to go APPLE.
love the apps & all the things you can do with it & the coverage is great.
Best computer I've ever had in my pocket, it even has a phone in it. I got the first phone when it came out. Gave it to my boss when I got the 3Gs. The first phone just quit working a few weeks ago, just before I got the 4G. So the boss has the 3Gs now. But that means the first phone lasted 3 1/2 yrs in steady use. I can see definite increase in speed, clarity, quality, ability, and capabilities. You have a telephone, camera, video camera, music player, internet surfer, sound recorder, and basically a darn good computer in your hand. The main thing stopping anyone from doing something with the iPhone 4 is the limits we put on our own imagination.
This is my 3rd iPhone. First, I had the 3G, which was an incredible piece of hardware that added faster network speed to the original iPhone--The cell phone that changed the cell phone industry forever. Next was the 3GS, which had the same core components, but more than doubled the processing speed of applications. The iPhone 4 not only doubled that same type of speed again, but added a flash to its upgraded camera, as well as an additional front facing camera for video conferencing, among many other advancements. Read the details on apple.com or bestbuy.com for the specifics, but I can tell you the biggest change for me is the HD retina display. This is something you will notice every time you pick up the phone, unlike the video calling/camera flash. The screen is incredible for watching movies (try netflix on the phone -- I feel like I'm in Back to the Future!), as well as regular browsing. Great job Apple for engineering this product, and to Best Buy for offering the best shopping experience!
I have had a cell phone for 17 years now and barely used it and down right did not carry all the time and lost it regularly now with this phone I can not put it down and only care to have this phone even if a new one comes out I understand where crackberry came from now only complaints. So far is the dropped calls/reception and the inability to delete multiple contacts at the same time
All iPhone 4's suffer from this...you just don't know it yet! Problem: The iPhone 4 currently cannot maintain a Bluetooth signal while listing to music when the phone is in your pants pocket. Simply put, you can't even go for a walk with your phone and listen to music via Bluetooth headset. Hardware used for testing 6 different IPhones 4/4.1 (ranging from purchases made on launch day in Canada till oct 15th) Various Blackberry's Various iPhone 3GS Plantronics Backbeat 903/906 Motorola Rokr S9 HD Rocketfish HD Jabra Halo Sony Ericsson Motorola Endeavor Blue Ant T1 How to test your iPhone 4 1. turn on Bluetooth headset 2. turn shuffle off in iPod settings (Settings - iPod - Shake to Shuffle - OFF)\ 3. play a song 4. verify that you can hear the music playing in your headset 5. Lock the screen 6. put your iPhone 4 in the front pocket of your pants or shorts, screen facing leg. 7.Go for a 5 min jog outside (happens much more frequently outside). If you're not a jogger then a walk around the block will trigger it. Basically it sounds like a CD skipping and progressively gets worse. Therefore anyone that goes for a walk or anything athletic cannot listen to music via Bluetooth headsets on. Being able to work out and listen to headsets with no wires is priceless, this phone cannot do that. Without this functionality working it's just a shiny regular phone. The kind of good news is if you own a 3GS or Blackberry it works great. 50 feet away at least. Or in your pocket while running, walking, full cardio training etc. very clear and never skipped once. Hint: it has something to do with the screen. We did all of the testing with the screen completely covered in various cases and we tried the phone with cases that had nothing covering the screen and no case at all. When the screen is in closed in a case or held in hand by its edges it works fine. With the screen exposed whether using a thin protective screen or not the problem happens. Note: all of the iPhones 4 were completely reset. One of the iPhone 4's we tested was never setup to be a phone, it was just used to play music. All failed the test. All other phones passed.
Cannot say enough. Call quality great. Does not drop as many calls as iPhone G3. Like a mini computer.
I know I sound like a fanboy here, but this iPhone is great. The on;y thing that i'd ask for is longer battery life, but i'd ask this of any phone. I'd call myself a power user - and when i'm on business trips i'm constantly using it to find restaurants and bars, then using the GPS to get from place to place. All-in all, i'm very happy.
I have had a 3gs in the past and love it. I love the new one. The graphics are so clear, whether playing games or watching high def movies. In the two years that I have owned a iphone, it has only froze once. It is a super reliable device. The battery life is ok, but battery technology is horrible for everything. It takes great pictures and would recommend to anyone.
This is my 3rd iPhone and so far the best. I have a friend that works for ATT and was shown the new Samsung Andriod. A very cool phone, however the iPhone seemed to still run smoother. The iPhone felt more solid and to be honest the screen had a richer look than the Samsung. I became an Apple guy back in 2008 and like they say "Once you go Apple, there's no going back".
Loved my old iphone (3G) and needed a new one. My old 3G iphone was great, but was running slow (iOS 4) New iphone with 1GHz of power! haha love it! Battery life...1GHz of power...bye bye battery. I will say that I was almost going to get an Android, but the 1.2ghz snapdragon was not coming out until Jan (6months...long wait). I have 2 friends that have the motorola droid and after playing with them I was not ready to switch (droid was not as smooth as the iphone), but if the droid had more power then I was thinking..hard about it.
I must say it is a relief to be able to multi-task! I've been waiting for this feature! The camera is amazing. It makes any pic you take a great one! I find no issue with the calls being dropped due to the cheek touching the outer rim antennae. I guess that's because a have a great case as well. The display is crystal clear. This phone is so much faster that my 3G even on the "Enhanced" network I find that the 4 is quicker than the 3G on the "Enhanced" network. The design is also an improvement. Overall I rate it 5 stars.
Upgrading from my 3GS to the 4 was so simple and easy. The dual cameras and improved megapixels were worth the upgrade. Coupled with the trade in from Best Buy for my 3GS made it all worth while and more. Overall the appearance and performance are worth upgrading for.
Best smart phone I ever had....very intuitive!!! I've tried the droid and the others no comparison! ATT service in NYC well thats another issue :)
The HTC EVO phone maybe a good competitor to the iPhone, but only the iPhone is the iPhone. Meaning, only Apple has pushed the boundaries of what a phone can be. The iPhone finally brings easy, video phone calls from fiction to reality. The true coolness of the app store with its millions of apps to choose from only really sinks in after you've had the phone for a while and get to explore a bit. Intuitive, cutting-edge, clean, elegant, I know I sound like a fan boy, but I was a PC guy until I got my first iPod. I've finally moved from my first generation iPhone to the iPhone 4...and it's worth every penny. It's made my life more organized - and increased my business. I couldn't recommend it more.
It has better battery life and it's ten times faster - what more could an iPhone lover ask for?! The only problem I had was Best Buy's mobile department messed up my account.
# Video calling with FaceTime # Retina display with 960 by 640 resolution # HD video recording # 5-megapixel camera with LED flash # Dual-mic noise suppression # Apple A4 processor # MMS # Voice Control
I design user interfaces on Windows mobile devices for a living. When my company briefly gave me an iPhone for evaluation purposes, it spoiled me for anything else. The iPhone basically has the Macintosh OS and toolbox, which has been honed by a decade of development on the desktop. The iPhone is part of the iTunes ecosystem, which has a considerable head start on anything else that it's not likely to relinquish. The iPhone enjoys Apple's fanatical dedication to great industrial design, and tight integration between hardware and software. And the iPhone has a cadre of motivated app developers who are always developing cool apps. Unlike Android phones, the iPhone does not have mobile carriers trying to corrupt it and take us back to the bad old days of being locked in to their network and their choices. When my company took the iPhone back because one of the execs needed to evaluate it, I immediately went out and bought my own. My only qualm about buying the iPhone was having to leave my old reliable carrier for AT&T, but that hasn't been an issue in practice.
Only problem was @ very beginning, before the New update, do that & get FREE CASE @ app store, iPhone4 free case program, or if you don't want to wait 2 weeks for them to send you a free one buy one & either return it when your free one comes in the mail, because you definitely need it because of the antenna problem! It definitely fixes it, nothing else to say bad about the phone. I've had an iPhone since the beginning & had every model, since & have loved every one of them, I would Not buy to UNLOCK this iPhone, because of the updates they are doing(iTunes/Apple)!! You will hate this phone if you spend $748.99 & your trying to Not use iTunes. You need the updates to fix any glitches! Good Luck & hope this helps you make your decision on buying the iPhone, O 1 more thing is ONLY BUY THE INSURANCE IF YOU BUY THE PHONE FOR FULL PRICE, then it's worth it. 11.99 a month when Apple. Will replace any broken iPhone for $199.99, unless you loose things or are around a bunch of thief's / stolen then your on you own, homeowners/car insurance claim would be better.
excellent futures great camera resolution Allow me to switch easily between recently used apps
Before I bought this phone I thought long and hard about switching to android,and since I was a stuck on ATT really my only other option was the samsung captivate.Went up to ATT the compared the two side by side.And Thats when I made the right choice.I love my IP4.Screen is way nicer than Super Amoled.The phone felt just way zippier,and the apps and app selection were alot better.I couldnt love it anymore. Pros: Best screen money can buy.Fast.Amazing Camera and HD recording.Super App selection.And for once no dropped calls. Cons:Can't fly you to the moon.
So far to date I have yet to add on my iTunes, but everything about this phone is awesome. Easy to use and has some great features that are better than my previous phone. I'm sure once I ad on more apps that I will get more use out of it than I already do. I just need to get my iTunes set up. I also purchased the iFrogz Case For Apple iPhone - Red/Black -- A great product. As well as ZAGG InvisibleSHIELD Screen Protector for Apple iPhone 4 - Clear -- A much needed item to keep your phone screen from getting all scratched up. The only problem I had was that I had to cut a little off to keep it from peeling off when I put the iFrogs Case on. Once I did that, it was all good.
best phone out there you download music and apps easy to use super fast opening apps and using the internet a must buy only bad thing is the phone service i would still get it
I like a lot of features it has like Camera/Video capability, quality of it, facetime and the size of it.
It is user-friendly, elegant, and very classy. I love using the iphone for entertainments, news, internet, youtube and other fun stuff.
For those of you that always have to have something to do, this is a great entertainer, along with a great phone. I have used it far more than I did my blackberry. It has also provided great entertainment for my 5 year old grandson. The users are getting younger and younger so thank you apple for continuing to turn out items that are fun to use and very easily managed.
I bought this phone for my wife to replace her US Cell dinasuar. Its an amazing phone with great capabilities - with the exception of holding a phone call.... that's odd for a phone. Again, Best Buy 0% financing is the way to go with these products.
I have had all three iPhones before the iPhone 4. This one is probably the worst. It is constantly unlocking the screen while on the phone and muting, turning on speakerphone, pushing buttons on the keyboard, or hanging up on people. It will also randomly go into a mode where regardless of where you are it will not get a signal and drains the battery. The screen is super clear and has great resolution (probably the only note-worthy upgrade). This phone feels more solid than the 3G or 3Gs but does not live up to the hype. Overall the phone is not worth getting and if you already have the 3Gs I would keep that until apple gets their act together.
Existing iPhone users should not have any problems figuring out how to use this new phone. The phone has now improved with the additional of a front-facing camera for "face time." I especially like the brighter and clearer screen thanks to retina display. I haven't tried the video editing and sharing yet, but I am glad to know it's available. It will come handy for when I go on vacation. Most of all, what's an iPhone without the iPod function and bluetooth. Works wirelessly well with my '10 Mazda's built-in bluetooth radio, no cables needed. Being able to multitask also while in the middle of a call is a useful function. Longer battery life ensures that you can be on the phone or text for longer periods of time. If you have the initial unlimited data, you get to keep it. Lastly, I have access to hundreds and hundreds of apps through iTunes. Unfortunately, it is not perfect. I am one of those customers who suffers from loss of signal if the phone is held via the black strip. Fortunately, with the iPhone case program (offer ends 9-30-10), I was able to get a free case which has helped reduce the contact with the black antenna strip. Hopefully, Apple will improve on this. I may return this phone, because I am still holding off for a white one. Otherwise, its an awesome phone.
Everything works great, simply one of the best Cell Phone in the market today. Apple did it again !
Works great ! Lot's of cool apps !!! Great for guitar players. I use it for finding chords and listening to music. No reseption problemss. The Facetime feature is very cool !!!
I purchased my iPhone4 as a replacement for a 3G. I was having issues with overall response times (very slow), especially since recently upgrading to the 4.0 OS. The iPhone4 is a great, usable device that is enabled with a number of new features - 5 MB camera, multi-tasking, etc. As all of these new features come at a cost, this new phone does, however, require some attention to the details to preserve battery life as long as possible.
I upgraded from the iPhone 3G when the OS 4 upgrade killed it's performance and I couldn't be happier with that decision. The iPhone 4 is the perfect size and weight, it's extremely fast with all my apps (even GPS), and never loses signal no matter where I am. My only suggestions to Apple are to 1) add a brightness adjustment button on the exterior, 2) make the vibrator stronger (it is hard to feel even when it's in my back jeans pocket right against me), and 3) allow WiFi syncing instead of having to plug the thing into my computer for updates and sync. Other than that, I think it's a fabulous phone that I will keep for a long time.
I love the iphone. I had 3g and was hooked (could never use a regular phone again). The only problem I have is when Im talking on the phone movement frequently causes my face to push random buttons, hanging up or activating a face time calls. I also have had increased drop calls from my 3g even with a case. but i still LOVE iphone and want everyone to have one (but all my friends avoid att :(
This phone is amazing...I expect it to come to my bedroom and sing and wake me up! Just kidding...it's just that it does so many things...and I am just beginning to use it . So far so good, except it did drop one call on me and I had the bumper on it. Maybe it's my inexperience with the phone. Time will tell. It appears to be an amazing piece of technology.
I had a palm centro but the screen was too small to really use for the Internet or email or skyping then I seen the iphone4 and FaceTime and said that's the phone for me! Great screen size and quality picture come together to create a awesome experience! Looked at the htc evo but it was too slow and very complicated apple has a very user-friendly phone suggest getting best buy black tie protection plan and otterbox case.
I love my new iPhone 4. I must say, it is almost perfect. It's fast, much better battery life than previous models, and as always so easy to use. Only one con I can think of. The phone function is a little weak. It has trouble making and holding on to calls in places where I did not use to have any problems. But then, I guess the phone part isn't really important for a product named the iPHONE.
Iphone4 best phone ever, I love all the apple products
I love my iPhone 4 Pros. 1. 5 megapixel camera takes very good photos, includes digital zoom and video. 2. Much improved performance. Cons. 1. Does not allow for a wifi hot spot, only single user tethering. 2. Needs single button toggles for wifi, 3G and bluetooth. I hate drilling in menus. On another note, Dropbox is my favorite iPhone app. It allows me to have access to all my critical files when away from my computers. They have a free 2GB account and larger paid accounts. http://www.dropbox.com/referrals/NTkzMzkwMTY5
Moved to the iPhone after Blackberry contract expired. Immediately upon purchasing the phone it had a 'no SIM' issue. Following the steps indicated by Apple Support I was able to get the phone to recognize the SIM card again. However, last week the issue resurfaced and, after first attempting to resolve the issue by having a new SIM card installed, it was necessary to return the phone for a replacement one. In spite of the problem, I really love the phone. My kids are so excited to work on their reading, math and spelling with all the great apps. Have had no dropped calls issues.
The phone proves to the be top of the line, This is my 3rth generation in I phone and I am very please with the phone, apple and Att, they will do anything possible to fix your needs
Poor reception!! Dropped calls a lot. Can't use at my house.
you can't get better than an IPhone it's a hand held computer movies books music all wrapped up in an AWESOME phone
This is an awesome phone. There is nothing that this phone cannot do. Tons of free apps!!
PROS:new face time feature,5mp digital camera,hd movie camera,better value:32 GB priced as 16GB 2 yrs ago,longer batttery life, unbeatable clarity, most apps among devices,best multi function device:mobile phone,ipod,portablemovie player,gps,portable gaming device,reference material for work,easy safari web browsing...endless! CONS: few dropped calls before getting the free bumper case from apple.still the most expensive.
I bought this phone because my phone now was getting really old... now i wish i hadnt. This phone is complete garbage. Antenna issues. Everything they said it was wrong with it is wrong. Im gonna change this one in for the samsung thingy or just go back to my 3g.
The phone is phenomenal. The a4 processor improves battery life big time, the retina display is such a gorgeous thing to look at. I've also noticed with the new antenna design I can pick up wifi signals alot further than i could before. I have not had any issues with dropped calls on it as well. This is by far the best phone to date.
Whether good or bad, the iPhone 4 lives up to the hype. Incredibly sharp resolution, a more than competent camera for stills or video, and very fast processor. I'm not a hardcore Apple guy but I looked at the Android phones (EVO, Streak, etc.) and they're really good at what they do. They come close but I still think Apple knocks it out the park. Alot of manufacturers tend to lose the top spot after awhile but I can't see this happening with this product anytime soon. Its not perfect, and thats simply because perfect doesn't exist when it comes to electronics. If you have an old iPhone and you're eligible for upgrade (I had the first gen iPhone no longer supported) then go for it. I bought the 32GB because that's all they had but considering how much it can do, I would recommend the 32GB simpy because of the all the video you're likely to take. Oh and another thing, your order for the free bumper case can take anywhere up to 4-8 weeks depending on which one you choose. I highly recommend you buy one in the interim. The thought of dropping the phone or scratching it is enough to send chills down your spine. You can always sell one of those cases later.
This is my first Iphone but some background: I recently bought the HTC Droid at BB and used it for about 2 days. Within those two days I really detested the Droid interface, at least on HTC. I found it very slow and not nearly as user-friendly as an Iphone. The HTC didn't really live up to what I expected. Maybe the other Droid phones are okay, but I am not chancing it. So, I got the Iphone 4 and I have not looked back. I have had ZERO call issues with the Iphone even without a silicone cover. I bought a third party cover anyway because I tend to be a bit rough with cell phones. I also have had no issues with screen yellowing or proximity sensor since I upgraded to the new IoS. The most amazing thing I liked was the screen. It is simply the clearest screen that you can buy now. The HTC did have a nice screen, btw. The interface is what shines on this product. It is almost like it senses what you are going to do. It is super-fast but I can't compare it to other Iphones because this is my first one. The camera is outstanding and takes awesome videos. I must add that the IMovie app is a dumb program, so I opted to use another program to edit my videos. Battery life for this phone is amazing. When it is not on, it seems to go forever. I went 3 days before fully charging the phone. A lot of Fandriods hate the App Store that Apple does. They complain that they don't like the control that Apple insists that programmers follow. But, guess what! Each carrier limits what 3rd party apps the Droid can have on it. So much for "open source" freedom. Apple also PAYS the developers and that fosters excellent applications. Yes, there are a plethora of bogus apps on the Iphone but you can file a complaint to the Apple store and the developers. 99% of the apps I use are for business anyway and they seem to work fine. The multitasking is neat, but I think it needs work on the Iphone. It seemed rather difficult to operate and manage. I just think it needs to be simplified. It would have been nice to have an external memory, but not a showstopper for me. I am also not happy with ATT because they refuse to have 3G or LTS in the rural areas. They don't really care about the out of the way places, so you only get Edge. That being said, Edge is far better than Sprint CDMA. I am very pleased with this product. I Think it is worth every penny I spent and the Iphone is better than I expected.
Pretty easy to use if you are tech savvy. Has a lot of cool features. Reception is pretty average. Texting on a touch screen takes a bit to get used to.
Very pleased to have finally been able to locate an IPhone 4. I am glad that I purchased my phone from Best Buy; Best Buy's Black Tie protection gives you full coverage on your IPhone 4 for 2 years, anything at all that goes wrong with your IPhone, they will replace it free of charge: water damage, dropped, broken, and driven over, anything but theft and loss!! You can bring your phone in inside a plastic bag in a million pieces and they will still replace it. With the Apple Care you are limited on what is covered, anything that you would have done, or could have done to the phone is not covered, but for what they do cover you are looking at a $200.00 deductible. The monthly fee is only $15.00 per month. You also get a loaner phone from Best Buy while you are waiting to receive your replacement IPhone 4 in the mail. The IPhone 4 so far, has held up to its name. Thanks Best Buy for beating the competition, you are a third party selling the IPhone and you are able to maintain stock of the item better than the promoting company. Way to go Best Buy!!
I absolutely love this iPhone4. I am getting reception where my old phones would not. It is very fast and the battery life is really remarkable. The screen display is stunning. I can't say enough good things about it after owning it for a month. Zero dropped calls and superb audio quality. The FaceTalk feature is well implemented. The camera is also outstanding. I can take really nice snapshots with it.
The iPhone is great! A few dropped calls but nothing major. The apps have been fun and useful. It is the easiest phone to use that I have ever had. The only drawbacks are the reception issue and the fact that MicroSoft . . . er . . I mean Apple is falling behind and taking it's customers for granted (learn how to play with Outlook). No 4G, price plans too expensive with ATT. I chose the iPhone because it was a bit more elegant and it does double duty (phone, iPod), but honestly there is no tech gap at this time it's just personal preference. I was a Sprint customer for 10+ years and have no real complaints, I'm disappointed with the attitude that Apple and ATT have. . . "we charge more because we're unique or better." Not anymore, the Android system is a touch better, faster, cheaper. Apple needs to clean up it's act and get in gear. I love the phone, but I've played with the EVO and it's sweet too.
Ok.., the whole antenna issue was not a problem for me cause I do not use it without a protective case.., don't see why would anybody not use one since is a valuable smartphone!., this iPhone has exceeded my expectations., I upgraded from 16 g 3G ., and believe me when I say it., this phone is really fast ., multitasking on this phone is truth to their advertising., I've seen what other smartphones can do, but I go with this phone on it's features , functionality., and ease of use.,, best 'ios' yet! Don't just take my word.., you have to own one to really experience what this iPhone can do!
It's an iPhone. The first, the best. Aside from the antenna issue it works flawlessly. A case solves the antenna problem. Besides, a case is just common sense anyway. Not trying to defend Apple's oversight of the problem just stating that it was a minor inconvenience. Its faster than previous iPhones, the display is great and it is very simplistic in its use. Still wish it supported Flash though.
Better than the iPhone 3 however amazingly still no flash player. This limits it severely on numerous websites. Droid has flash. Also the well-known antenna problem and the case and screen scratch very easily despite what Apple and Mr. jobs say. Buy case and screen protectors.
This is my 2nd iPhone and I don't think I'll ever switch to another smartphone unless Apple stops making them. The iPhone was my first smartphone and I couldn't see myself with anything else but. I have tested other smartphones, but this beats the everything that comes out in my opinion. People dislike the iPhone just because it's an iPhone! I was the same way until I purchased one. The possibilities are endless. And the sad thing is, the average person who owns it doesn't know what they have, because they are unaware of what it can do.
It was very pricey but that is my fault cause I couldn't wait for my contract to end so I had to pay early upgrade price. But I love it. way more features added. The camera is great. the webcam is so cool. I have not had antenna problems. I looks really thin in person. alot thinner than you would think. and the d isplay is so bright and crisp. very sleek looking. The only bad thing is the webcam works only with other iphone 4's and only on wifi. and the speakers are not great.
Even though I can replicate the "grip of death" causing signal attenuation, I still get far better reception than I did with my 3GS. I would have upgraded to the 4 just for that alone, but the retina display has to be seen to be believed. The picture on the iPhone 4 is now ridiculously clear and crisp. Add in a faster processor and front-facing camera, and the decision is a no-brainer.
DO NOT believe the HYPE. This phone works like a dream - my old iPhone dropped no more or less calls. The service is no different. It is still BY FAR the best cell on the market. Kudos, Steve Jobs!
I have owned the 3G & 3GS, this by far the best of the iPhones! I purchased a case when I bought the phone & have not experienced the "anntenegate" issue. The proximity sensor barely works which causes me to end calls abruptly. The battery is great. However, my phone only charges to 95%. Apple will repair the phone for free. The process is lengthy and a little ridiculous. It takes great photos and video! I take at least 25 pics a day for work and email them out. The pics are better then the office Nikon. I recommend this phone to all. It's the closest to looking into the future without calling Doc Brown and using the time machine!
My iPhone 4 works as Apple said it would! I have not had anymore dropped calls than I've had with any other cell phone I previously used. In fact, I get better reception in my home with this iPhone than with my old Razr using the same provider - AT&T Mobility. I've had my iPhone since the day they were released - June 24th and Apple has had two iOS updates (4.0.2) and they've installed without a hitch. BTW, this is my first smart phone and the apps all work as described and I've found the learning curve to be quite easy. The battery life was less than I initially thought it should be, but due to my spending a lot of time "playing" with my new phone I now see that I was the cause of the short battery life. The honeymoon period is about over and the battery is lasting several days now - unless I read for a couple of hours using one of the four free eReader apps that I have downloaded and installed . Over all this is an amazing tool. I now find myself spending less time on my desktop PC due to the connectivity capabilities of my iPhone 4. I am giving this iPhone a 5-Star rating - I like it that much!
This phone is years ahead of the competition!!!!! Great job Apple! You have finally detroned BlackBerry!!!
The hype is absolutely true about this phone. It has simplified many things in my life. I love love love it! No more hanging on to my palm treo and I POD at the same time. Thank you Apple!
They phone is awesome and works great! The new design and phone performance is good.
The iPhone 4 improves on the 3GS. The 4 is faster, has a longer battery life, has a better screen, and has a better camera. The camera flash and the front-facing camera (as well as FaceTime) are great additions. Of course, the iOS is simple to use, yet powerful. This is my third iPhone, and I love it. I highly recommend the iPhone 4!
This is my 4th iphone, starting with first generation and moving up the ladder to the latest 4th generation. To be honest all iPhones have given me trouble :-) I had to return the fist iPhone 4 as it kept saying 'sim not installed' got it changed at apple store, the new equipment is working flawless. All said and done, with its flaws and down side, apple has its own charm and user will also feel high just because of the product name itself.
Wasn't able to get the last upgrade to the 3Gs so I waited for this release. For 3Gs users, the three big differences are (1) the dual camera (front and back) that gives you more options as well as the FaceTime funcationality, and then (2) faster chip set with more memory to better handle multitasking and (3) larger battery for longer usage.
The phone has a great camera with features to match. The OS 4 lets you switch in and out of apps with ease. Talk quality is crisp and clear and the best feature is the screen making videos in HD perfection.
It's definetilly the best phone availble yet. Dispite the signal issue, I always keep my phone protected with a case, so I haven't experienced any signal problems yet. The 5 mp camera quality is gourgeos, and Face Time pretty sweet (once is jailbroken and have 3G unrestrictor installed). Internet, superfast. Overall design, superb. Battery life, above average.
Just flat out love the phone. Camera, apps, hd video instant upload to YouTube I really can't say much is wrong with this phone
Initially I had a few kinks, but uploading a couple of updates solved the problems. My only complaint is with the provider, AT&T. They drop calls like crazy!!! The new IPhone is very fast, but the dropped calls are very annoying. I hope in the future IPhone will be available from other carriers. The camera functions are awesome!!!
This phone is really nice i recommend you get the black tie plan with it
let me clarify that my entire family has iPhones. I had a 3G which had been through the paces, encountered water but came back to life with the exception of blue tooth. So the need for a new phone was definite. I applied the os version 4 to my 3G and my phone no longer worked. since it was older and had encountered water, the only recourse was to purchase the 4.0 sooner than I had planned. The new 4.0 iPhone is plagued with dropped calls and the proximity sensor not always working. Haven't really seen much of a performance boost either. The good parts are the display is much clearer, voice activated calling and multi-tasking. Set up was a breeze. Would rather research a Droid to see what to do with all my iTune music. iPhone 4 is cool, but I so far I think its over priced.
Superior to most if not all phones on the market. In my opinion the antenna/dropped calls was more media hype than anything else. I have purposely tried to replicate this issue myself without success. Additionally. Most if not all intelligent iPone users have a case and would not have this little problem. Battery life doesn't seem to be any better (which I was hopping for). Worth every penny, great at the upgrade price.
This was my first iPhone purchase and I never jumped on the train because I was locked into a Sprint contract. I had no issues with Sprint, but I have always wanted to get the iPhone for the apps and iTunes compatibility. I have had the phone for about a month and have had no issues at all to complain about. The screen resolution is amazing and the battery life and reception here in Minneapolis have been great. I would highly recommend it.
Reception problems? Dropped calls? I have no idea what all the hype was about. I have had no problems with my iPhone 4 and am enjoying the experience of exploring different apps, staying in contact with friends and family, taking pictures, etc. The camera takes awesome pictures. The only thing I have yet to experience is Facetime. I can't wait to hook up with others with this incredible device to try it out.
Phone kept freezing, reception was a huge issue, and my proximity sensor was so out of whack that my cheek would sometimes call people, send messages, end calls. Ultimately it was ridiculous that I had to wrap a stainless steel and glass phone with plastic to make it work. Went back to my 3GS and will wait a year to see what Apple does next.
Great phone not perfect but what is. Who would thing a phone would do all this.
I upgraded from a 3G and the biggest things I've noticed are the speed, display and battery life. I've had a little bit of a issue with the antenna issue but I have a Griffin Reveal case and I got the Apple bumper for free and I don't drop bars with either of those on it.
I might not stay with Apple for next smart-phone Launch who knows what B-A smart-phone will be out then.. I had the iPhone 3g so this iPhone 4 was A Major Upgrade.... So far this is the best smart phone available especially since Jail-breaking your iPhone is LEGAL.....If I couldn't Jailbreak my iPhone I would of never bought one..................... Cydia and rock are a must for any iPhone user of any model.................................................................... NOTE: Cydia and Rock are third party APP Stores!!!!!!!!!!You jailbreak iPhone and get to use these great APP stores.....All the apps that Apple Ban are on these third party App Stores...............Enjoy your iPhone 4 you will not regret it but you must get a case/Bumper...I have the Apple Bumper and I love it.....All case so far mess with your flash and ruin pics so that would be a downgrade so I highly recommend the Apple iPhone 4 Bumper....You can get 1 free,or a third party case.You need this because of the Antenna Problem.....The iPhone 4 does not feel right without a case anyway...I did however buy bodyguardz for the front and back on my iPhone 4 so with that and the bumper iPhone is protected!!!!!!!.....One can also purchase best buy insurance for your iPhone 4 for $14.99 a month which is high but no questions asked and they give you a refurbish model/Maybe new but I doubt it......If yours breaks.........................................................................P.S. I recommend the iPhone 4 32gb......Because the Hard drive gets filled up fast so if you can't make your mind up just go big or stay home..Get the 32gb I'm glad I did I thought about it for a while and now my iPhone hard drive is full and I need to delete some stuff...Hope this helps people...
This phone, out of all the phones ive had is by far the best. The new retina display is actually what its been made out to be. the clarity of the 5mp camera on the back is great for taking pictures of mail letters, you can actually see the letters sharply instead of a blurry word. The flat back makes it less bulky for pocket travel compared to the old oval shape of the 3G/S. The LED light is much better than the flashlight apps. The cam on the front is decent but not quite as clear as i thought it would be. Face Time would be great if i could find a friend with an iphone4, downside is, you have to be connected to WiFi. I myself have not experienced any problems such as the Display color or Reception ive only had 3 or 4 dropped calls since i got mine last month, ive had more problems with my 3GS as far as dropped calls go. Battery life is moderate depending on what you do with it all day. The HD video recording isgreat, along with Hulu+ coming soon it will be even better being able to watch FULL HD shows on the go for $9.99/month, some say not worth it but i disagree. This is the ULTIMATE phone for those who like Apple+Touch screen's with a QWERTY keyboard. Apple has come a LONG way since the first iphone with a max of 8GB capacity, no send/recieve mms, and a Metal backing that dents in your pocket all for a whopping $600. Props to Apple for this peice of art that they have created.
Regardless of all the bad hype concerning the antenna, the iPhone 4 is by far the best smartphone in the marketplace.
I have not been experiencing the iPhone 4 issues. As such, I could not be more happy with my purchase.
NO problems with phone so far. No drop calls, easy to use. great slim feature, multi task is great once you get the hang of it. great to play games and movies. fantastic dual cameras
This is my first smart phone, and the transition has been seamless. Whenever there's a question about operating the phone, my first guess is almost always the right one. Figuring out the camera, mail, app store, and so on is incredibly simple. The camera is easy to use, and takes surprisingly excellent shots, especially with the Tilt Shift Generator app.
I hate my new iPhone 4. The screen is too sensitive, and it seems like I need to shut it off and turn it on when things go wron.
I tend to have a strong signal so don't experience the "grip of death issue". Piece of advice... When setting up your phone in I-Tunes, do not restore from a previous back up as it will cause some glitches, set up as a new phone. I did this shifting from my 3G to 4 initially and had some problems. I restored and started over and am very satisfied.
Coming from an iPhone 3G, I took a big step up. I really notice and appreciate the evolution of the iPhone with this new model. The design, the features, the screen resolution. It shoots HD video (bye bye Flip video cameras) The processor is super fast, the phone is built like a mini tank, it's tough looking yet has that industrial yet functional look and feel to it as well. Everyone is complaining about the reception on the "grip of death" fiasco, but my personal experience is great with the reception. I also bought the Belkin clear case and it looks great. Especially coming from the 3G, this phone with reception problems and all, is still miles better than the 3G. I can't say enough how much I'm loving the battery life on this baby. It lasts me the entire day without charging. Again coming from the 3G, the battery only lasted about 5hrs on a full charge. My only knock on the iPhone 4 is that even with the 2yr contract at $299.99 it's too much. While the Droid X is out there for $100 cheaper with a 2yr contract, Apple is hurting itself by pricing themselves out of the market considering Droid phones are excellent as well.
I was a loyal user of the iPhone 3GS. I upgraded as soon as I could only to find a few key problems. The antenna issue exists and is frustrating. They gave me a bumper but now all of my chargers don't fit appropriately. My 2 Bluetooth headsets won't work well any more. I sound terrible to the people with whom I am speaking. Any it is slower than the 3GS, in my opinion, likely due to the overhead of the new OS. If I could do it all over again, I would have waited.
I had the 3G unit and liked that one a lot but the G4 is even better. Good quality feel and functions are fast. The camera is 4 times faster than the 3G and thus eliminates a lot of fuzzy photos in dim light. Also the ability to switch from back to front camera is very cool and fun! The tiny LED light could be a tad brighter but after all this is not a camera, it's a computer with a phone built in. The battery is finally strong enough to get me through a full day of use but I do charge it every night to be sure it works the next day. My old 3G required a bulky add on battery to get me through a full day so not having that requirement is a great feature with the 4G. I have not had a single issue with signal drop that was not the fault of AT&T. They just can't seem to keep up with the huge data demand all these phones require. But I have some experience in the cellular business and know that if all the iPhones were suddenly moved to another network carrier they too would have similar dropped call problems. I did get a case with the unit before I heard about the antenna issues so I'm not familiar with hand touch issues. All in all this phone is a good deal in my view. The more I use it the less I can be without it.
Forget the hooplah..... it's an amazing phone!! I've had the 3g, 3gs & now the 4 and I couldn't be happier. Reception is great, speed is great and it feels great in your hand. Pictures and screen are amazing. There is only one complaint.... the sensor is too sensitive. When you're on a call and place the phone on your shoulder against your ear, if the phone senses light, it thinks you've taken it away from your ear and activates the touch pad. Which of course means your ear is pressing buttons. I know that there is a fix coming, so it's not a major concern for me. Other than that, it's great!
I'm not even gonna comment on the reception issue. By the time this review is being posted, Apple has already introduced the iPhone 4 Case Program (which provides a free case for every new iPhone purchased through Sept. 30, 2010), so that effectively addresses that issue. The issue that I will touch on that I consider a flaw is Battery Life. The phone's battery needs to be recharged halfway through the day for even the casual user. You will need to recharge more often if you are active on the data network (messaging, email, apps or web surfing: WiFi or 3G). I have tested the battery by going to the Apple Store Genius Bar an it checked out green. I also have turned off the 3G capability and used the phone in airplane mode (separate tests on separate days, both from full charges). Airplane mode will allow you a full days usage without having to recharge. Turning off 3G, will get you through 70% of your day, provided you are not actively/vigorously using the device, before you need a charge. In short, the claim that the A4 chip provides better battery life is a bit exaggerated. With Wondows Mobile or RIM phones; those devices can go days before needing a full charge. Of course, the previous statement was from personal experience. All the other functions are calibrated to perfection. Third-party apps have bugs but that's on that developer. All features are responsive and iOS4 is a crown jewel. I am 30+ days into my iPhone 4 experience and I have not doubted one minute of it. I recommend the phone, hands down, no reservations, but be wary of the short battery life.
Love this phone. I owned the 3GS for a year, and now have the iPhone 4. NIce size, great display, better battery life, better reception, facetime. A no-brainer to buy.
Had a 3g and upgraded to IPhone4. I always put my phones in a case to protect them and had no problems with reception and I always use a headset. Great phone!
I am new to the Iphone. I previously had a Droid Eris and there is no comparison. Everything about the Iphone 4 is better. The touch screen works so much better on the Iphone and the number and QUALITY of apps is much better with the Iphone. I have had no issues with reception but have had a case on it from when I got it. My wife got one as well and originally wanted nothing to do with a touch screen but loves her Iphone 4.
I have to admit, I love iPhone 4. It's fast, it's thin, and overall it's "magical" (to put it in Apple's latest buzzword for its press releases). My favorite feature is the Retina Display, text is crisp and pictures are sharp. Its nearly impossible to be able to pick out individual pixels. Nearly everything is improved on this iPhone. This is the part where I clarify why I say "nearly everything". There has been a lot of press regarding iPhone 4 reception. Most people including myself have not had any problems. Others have reported problems where touching a certain spot on the stainless steel band (the antenna) kills the signal. Apple decided to provide free cases/bumpers to help avoid the problem while they try to figure out the issue. Best Buy also stepped in and is providing free InvisibleSHIELD side strips to insulate the antenna.
My last phone was the Motorola Krazor, just to let you know. I Love my new IPhone4! It's built like a tank, it feels incredibly solid and it was so easy to learn to use. The picture and video quality are amazing. That you have a camera on Both sides of the phone is just way cool. As for call quality? In my opinion, even with a bar less, my clarity is beyond what I had with my last phone. And, I needn't mention the utter convience of having access to your bank, to store sites, to having travel directions, to the almost utmost in entertainment. I'm SO happy I purchased!
There have been a lot of negative comments about this phone but if you are an iPhone fan, this is definitely worth the price. The display is amazing, the phone is very clear. It is also incredibly fast. I love love live this phone!!!
No doubt, this is a great phone. If you are a iPhone fan than this is a must. However, if you are using a 3GS than the early upgrade is not worth it. Especially with the real defect problems the iPhone 4 is encountering. Apple and AT&T will need to sort out their differences to stay above the competition curve. As of today, I would NOT recommend this product.
After using the iPhone 4 for a month I am very pleased with the signal strength is holding to four bars or better. No "Dropped Calls." I realize in different locations "Dropped Calls" may happen. I wish all locations didn't have this problem and ASAP this problem will be fixed. With the A4 chip set, I/O data flow is processed so much faster than early iPhone models. All the features that iOS4 comes with I like having multi-tasking, creating folders to insert Apps, having an email inbox to handle all of my email accounts and the sharpness/brightness screen display no other smartphone can beat. The only flaw I see is I wish the retail price point was lower, so everyone can buy one. Thank you Apple, Inc. for building a smartphone without bugs or security issues.
I have none of the problems that the media seems so excited about. This device simply feels more solid and responsive than any other current cell-phone device. I'm not a maverick; I like things simple. Apple does it better than anyone. And this is SO much more than a phone. Now my wife and I both have these and our kids have our old 3GS phones (and they love them too).
I bought the iphone 4 about a month ago. I previously owned the iphone 3Gs. Cons: I have to say I'm a little disappointed with the new one. The calls are horrible! I'm constantly dropping calls even with the case and I often cant even make calls out. Same with sending and receiving text messages. I don't really like that you can't use the face time (video calls) with the 3g network, you have to be connected to wifi. Also the battery life isnt that much better then the 3Gs. Pros: I do like a few new features though. I really like that you can switch the camera mode to face you. It really helps if your trying to take a picture of yourself. I also like that they added a light for the camera. I do like the feature of creating folders. It allows me to download more apps and keep them organized. Overall I think that its a really cool concept but it is a phone and the fact that I can hardly make or receive 70% of my calls and text is a really disappointment!! Its basically used just for the apps and camera at the moment. I would say that I would not recommend this to a friend only based on the fact of the reception. If they happen to fix the problem then I would recommend this to everyone because it would be a great phone!!!!
I absolutely love my IPhone 4. I have no problems with it whatsoever except for an occaisonal dropped call (that is the reason for my 4 rating instead of 5). The battery life is much better than my IPhone 3G and I love the feel and comfort of it.
Hands down the best phone I've ever owned. I went from an iPhone 3G to this and the improvements are huge. Love it! The atenna issue is not that bad and non-existent when in the case. I always get a case, so not an issue for me. The camera does 720p and the display is phenomenal. This blows away my 3G in performance. Plus every app I buy works an my phone, my wife's phone, our iPod touch, and even on the iPad if I want. Web browsing is great on this phone. Did this review from it. Apple has made a fanboy out of this Windows Engineer :)
Have not had ANY problems with this phone. All the new features are worth upgrading.
I got what I paid for. Great UI, processor much faster, better camera and 720p video has been great. FaceTime calls were better than I thought they would be.
If Apple can fix the overly sensitive proximity sensor so I stop accidentally hanging up on people with my ears, this would get 5 stars.
Even if you don't like the iPhone or AT&T, you should be thankful that this phone is on the market. This thing just set the bar again, and other manufacturers will be racing to keep up. The screen is unreal, you really can't see pixel separation. I used to think my last 2 iPhones, the 3G and 3GS had great screens. When I hold my old 3G or 3GS, it's like holding a plastic toy compared to the solid feel of this new phone. I don't have any reception issues, and I didn't really have any with the previous phones either, so the Antenna issue is a non issue for me. I don't know how any other phone will ever get me to switch from the iPhone.
Everyone knows the iPhone is the greatest phone ever created but it does have it's flaws like every other phone. The iPhone is extremely easy to use and the OS is the most advanced and easy software out there not to mention apple has the best AppStore. Anything you can think of this phones does but the only downfall is the signal issues and at&ts horrible slow 3G network. This phone would be great for verizons network. But overall it's worth the issues that it does have
I've spent 30 days with this phone. #1 issue: reception. It is not an issue. If you hold this device normally while in phone mode, there is no problem with reception or dropped calls. If you place this device in a certain type of casing, it allows you to hold the iPhone 4 any way you please without having to worry if you're holding it a certain way and possibly losing an important phone call at any given moment. Without mentioning names, I have looked at the other competitors offerings. Some of them close the gap, but Apple clearly has invented and made a product they believe in. You can see that just by looking at the cosmetics of the device, let alone the made easy internal intricacies.
I've been a "PC guy" since the late 80's, so I'm no Apple Fanboi. This little computer that happens to make phone calls, however, rocks. Ease of use and consistency across all applications are both excellent. The antenna issues are irrelevant: just don't hold it that way. I'm definitely a fan of Apple after using this phone.
Retina display is, by far, the best of any smartphone. It makes pictures and movies look as good as my HD TV. Battery life much better than 3GS. No antenna issue at all. Camera captures really good pictures. HD video looks awesome. LED flash can be used as flashlight (with app). iOS4 works great with multi-tasking, folders, etc. Best overall smartphone. Others may have certain things that are better but nothing comes close to the overall package.
There are 2 phones on the market. The iPhone 4 and those that allow you to just make phone calls. What can you say about features, the iPhone has access to 250,000+ apps. Any Questions? The battery life is okay. I put a case on my precious iPhone since day one, so I never noticed the antenna problem.
What can I say that hasn't been said about the iPhone. I'm a former 3G owner which I proudly owned for two years and absolutely loved. Of course it's not perfect, everyone knows about the antenae issues and what not, but it's still an iPhone, and once you've owned one, you'll find yourself hard pressed to own anything else. The camera was upgraded immensely and the video camera is nothing short of amazing. Facetime is great and the screen resolution is second to non. It multitasks quickly, and it's built like a tank.
Lots of talk about the antenna but I put a case on mine before I left the store and it works perfectly. Apple hits a home run again. I have been very pleased with all the new features.
Let me be clear that I am not a huge Apple guy, I buy what I like and what works. I own a Macbook Pro and an iMac, the decision to buy the iPhone 4 was entirely on my wife who loves her iPhone 3G. I was using a Nokia 2320 (candy bar phone) prior to the iPhone 4. My wife and I picked up our iPhone 4s last week from Best Buy. The 3+ week lead time from Apple was a bit much so I spent the last two weeks calling around to different stores and finally lucked out. Having owned the phone for a few days, I can tell you the following things... ** ....Initial Observations.... ** The screen is absolutely beautiful, reception is very good. I live in the Los Angeles area and the reception is definitely improved. As far as the whole "antenna gate" thing that went on.... now that I have one in my hand, I can safely say that it was overblown and possibly a hoax. I love that I can fit my whole music library on this thing. I use an iPod nano but am slowly using the iPhone instead. The nano has the Nike + iPod sensor but apparently the iPhone 4 does as well. Nice! Comes with remote headphones, AC adapter, and dock cable. "finger tips" manual for learning how to use your phone was kinda clever. ** ....About the Antenna.... ** Ok, with all the drama in the media about the infamous "antenna gate," I think it is fair to dive right in and give the straight dope from someone who owns one. Driving home from Best Buy, my wife "gripped" the iPhone 4 all the way home....it never lost signal, this was pre iOS 4.0.1. In our place, we had 5 full bars of signal....after the update it dropped to 3 bars. Basically, everything Apple said the iOS 4.0.1 update would do, it did, and exactly the way Apple described it. As far as "grip of death," it will drop a bar or two (sometimes 3) if I am literally "choking" the phone. If I touch the little band on the bottom-left, it will drop a bar if I'm already in low signal area but I've not seen it if I am in a 5-bar area. As an anecdote, my wife called me as she was driving home and talking on her iPhone 4. I was sitting on our couch in the living room and the call dropped. She called me back and said she had full signal, I had 3 bars....this is not new since we have dropped calls in our living room with the iPhone 3G on AT&T's 3G network. However, I decided to see if I could get the call to drop signal. This I don't mind sharing even though it sounds a little unorthodox. As an experiment, I took the iPhone 4 into the most isolated place in our home--the bathroom. I gripped/covered the iPhone with the real "grip of death," covering the phone all over, and stood in the bathtub while talking to my wife. I had it up to my ear and only checked the signal every so often. I got the signal down to 1 bar 3G and my wife said she could hear me loud and clear....never dropped or cut out, we were on the phone for another ten minutes until she finally got home. The call never dropped, she sounded perfectly clear, and she said I sounded just fine and couldn't tell where I was or that I was cutting out. We have 3 bars on average in our home, usually that's the most I see. I was really surprised because of all places, cell reception in our bathroom would have been a surprise since it's the most isolated part of our home. I'm really impressed how well the iPhone 4 holds signal, especially while gripping the phone. I don't see any real difference using it in a case or not. By the way.... Touching the spot on the phone with the little black line does NOT drop calls like people are saying it does. Maybe they have bad phones but so far neither of us have been able to drop a call by touching it or by gripping the phone. ** ....Speed + Battery Life + Quality.... ** The phone is very fast....the ability to bring up an App is as fast. We also noticed that after prolonged use of any intensive apps, the phone does get warm. I have been using the iMovie app and because the phone is so fast it actually "renders" the film right on the phone. I was very impressed by that. The battery seems to last 2-3 days of moderate phone and data usage. Face Time is really nice if you have family and close friends. I called a friend of mine (who got his IPhone 4 at launch) with it and he was showing me around his new place with the camera. The camera also takes really nice pictures--I was impressed when we got home and pulled them up on our home iMac. They look great, esp. for a camera phone. ** ....Conclusion.... ** Neither of us have had any issues with our phones, and are really enjoying the Facetime feature the most. I do not use mine in a case (commando style) but my wife does, cases are sort of hard to find right now. Apple is going to be sending out free cases (already got my notification) so you save $20-$30 right there. On the whole, we are both very happy with the iPhone 4. I use mine commando-style (no case) and it sits in a horizontal belt clip. My wife uses a green frog case for hers because we discovered the glass back of the phone will let your phone slide around on your car seat, couch, or anywhere else. Truly, it's the best cell phone I've ever owned. I suggest that if you are on the fence about getting one, get it and try it out for a few days. Apple extended the buyer's remorse period so you can get your money back if you don't like it.
Say what you want or read what you want, but this new iPhone4 has worked flawlessly for me. Runs faster than the iPhone 3g I previously owned. I like the flat look, instead of the old model, the hi retina display is rich in color and the HD video camera is also a treat. Go get one, you won't be sorry.
Phone software is a little buggy as to be expected with a new major os update but should be fixed when apple releases new software update. Phone has never crashed though. Definitely recommend.
This phone is perfect. Nothing more that I can say here. Oh, and I don't have any antenna issues. In fact, this thing picks up more wifi signals than both my computer and laptop!
I've owned Windows CE phones and Blackberry phones in the past. I purchased my first iPhone when the 3G was released. I feel the iPhone has the best set of features and functions in the smart phone arena. Ease of use, abundant amount of apps available, and and best design come together to make one of the best smartphones I've ever used. I upgraded to the iPhone 4 on day one. I still feel the same about this phone as I do my first. And with the new features and functions of the 4, it just keeps getting better. Now, I can't say it's perfect. I've had a few dropped calls, but no more than my 3G, and really, no more than any other phone I've owned. So, I'd say it performs basically the same as others. I don't have any issues with AT&T, so I have no complaints. I've used all the other carriers over the years and I like ATT the best. The only phone type I haven't owned is an Android based. But I have used them and played with them. They are OK for a phone, but to me it's akin to the Windows and Blackberry types. Standard features and functions, but put it all together and it's missing that something. The iPhone just has it, the others don't. And I'm not one to to take sides with Apple. I've used Apple devices over the years, but I won't buy it unless its the right tool, not just because its Apple. They made a great product and it shows. Specifically on the iPhone 4, the screen is out of this world. You have to see it and compair it to really understand the difference from this phone and all other phones on the market. The dual cameras are great, and the new flash is a welcome addition. The v ideo is great and in HD as well. Plus all the built in functions that allow you to make a video and then send it directly to YouTube is cool. Books look great in the new iBooks on that screen,and surprisingly easy to read on such a small screen I can keep going on, but in the end, you'll need to play with one to see if it's what you are looking for in a smart phone.
Back in 2008 I was able to get my grandparents to buy me an iPhone 3G. In 2009 I was offered a 3Gs, but did not upgraded knowing that the next iPhone would be much better. Boy was I right! I pre-orded it and when I got it I was amazed. The phone is so customizable because it's so easy to use, yet for someone advanced like me, I can make it do so much more than the simple stuff. This phone even works for the visually impaired! Also, if you want to protect your phone with a case, but don't want to cover its body up, get a bumper case, there the best case EVER!
I do have the Antenna problem as well as the proximity detector problem which I hope will be fixed soon. Overall, my best smartphone ever.
My wife is not a tech person but she is very jealous since she can't update till December but then again she wants the white one.. Never had a problem with it droping calls because of the way I was holding it. In areas where reception was not as good with my 3GS I have better reception with this phone. If you live in an area with good at&t coverage go for it... I was able to keep my unlimited data plan and glad I can with this phone.
Why lock yourself into a two year contract for a phone that has issues? Antennagate has been overstated in the press, but the problem is real. Calls are dropped, and Apple's response has been dismissive. Gaming the software to hide the problem associated with the "Deathgrip" is insulting. A free bumper is that least Apple can do, but no bumpers are currently available. The battery life is improved on the iPhone 4, and the camera & video upgrades are great. All told, however, why would anyone buy a phone that continues to have problems and fall below even Apple's own standards? Get an updated iTouch next month or wait for the iPhone 4 to come to other carriers after the engineers fix the few bugs the Black iPhone 4 possesses. Love Apple, Don't Love iPhone 4.
Have had this phone since it was released, overall very happy. Free case on the way from apple to resolve antenna issue. I never felt the antenna issue was a problem honestly seems the bars went down but didn't affect the call. Battery is better than the 3GS so that's nice, screen is beautiful when playing videos. Droid x is bigger and the screen is huge but I'll stick with apple, the OS is more refined and smoother.
Love it .. No problem... It does so much.. More then I could ever think of
There has been a lot of media generated news about the I phone, and the noise has been heard by millions. Media coverage creates advertising revenue for them, thus this results in exaggerations such as antenna gate. My experience with the I Phone has been exceptional, especially in the following areas that are important: 1). Speed, yes it is blazing fast both in web browsing and in all the applications. I am experiencing much faster data speeds that with my previous I Phone. 2). Application switching works, fast and as advertised. It will get better as more applications are updated. 3). Application availability and cost - it has become a tremendous productivity tool for me with applications that I pick and use everyday . 4). Simple user interface - just makes it easy to use and you do not have to be technical to take advantage of all the things it can do for you. My advice, try it, most 98.5% love it; if not return it for a refund within 30 days. How can you beat that?
I like the iPhone 3GS style better! But I sure do like the screen on the iPhone 4! Memory seems to be must better! Internet speed is still some what slow!
I have had the iPhone 3G, 3GS, and the difference between them and the iPhone 4 is catastrophic. The display is insanely clear. I am very impressed with the battery life. I wish it was a bit better but it is a smart phone. The reception was not bad. It did have an issue if your gripped the bottom left corner. I wouldn't lose the call but I would drop 2-3 bars. I purchased a bumper case for $29 and I can now get better reception than I ever have with any other phone. My parents live out in the country, very hard to get reception there. With this phone I can actually get about 4 bars there. I love it to say the least, from the new design to the new software, it truly is amazing.
Having owned and loved my iPhone 3G from the moment I got it, I have been waiting for this upgrade for some time. I did not feel the 3GS offered enough to upgrade, and I was not yet far enough into my contract to upgrade, anyway. I am very happy with the iPhone 4 so far. The screen is...more than amazing, it is unlike any screen I've ever seen. The performance is extremely fast, battery life is improved, the multi-tasking for audio, GPS, etc. is a very welcome change. Unlike some others, I like this new design better, although I admit it probably does not fit in your hand as well as the 3G and 3Gs' curved back. The all-glass design, while beautiful, is a smudge-magnet--I've already purchased a minimalist case that covers the back and sides. I am not sure about the reception drop, as I have experienced a temporary loss of internet connection via some apps at times, but not for long. Calls have been fine. The camera and video quality is fantastic, too. All in all, this is a big improvement in Apple's iPhone, and I have no regrets at all about the upgrade.
I bought the iPhone 4 the first day int came out and loved until I realized it gets NO reception. I have been looking at my phone for the past 30 mins and haven't gotten one bar and it's been like this since day one. I would love the phone if I was able to receive calls and not drop about 31 droped calls since I got the phone. I am a huge apple fan, MacBook, MacBook pro, iPhone 3GS, iPad, Mac mini but this is the first product I was hugely disappointed. I real hope they could fix this because if they did I would raise my rating to a 5.
I have been an Apple lover eversince the ipod came out. This phone is really amazing. i wonder what it doesn't do.
I was an iPhone 3Gs user for about a year. When BestBuy started the preorders on this phone, I was first in line to preorder. I picked mine up on 06/24/2010. I have been amazed ever since. The retina display is jsut so clear and crisp. The applications are much faster than previous iPhones. I would highly recommend getting one of these if you have the money.
I owned the iPhone 3G for the last couple of years and decided to skip the 3Gs. I will say moving to the iPhone 4 is a HUGE upgrade from the 3G. Biggest impact for me personally is the camera. I love the video feature and the quality is awesome especially on the retinal display. I have read some of the comments about the 5 megapixel camera being inferior, but I'm not printing posters from my images so 5MPs works fine for me. The folders feature is really cool too as I have about 6 pages of apps that I can organize finally. The other concern out there is the degrading antennae problem based on how you "hold" the phone. I HAVE seen this on my phone but so far it only does that when I am in a confined room. When I am outside I don't see that happen as much. This leads me to believe it is either an OS issue or AT&T signal strength issue (which may not be a surprise). I recall my 3G had only 1 bar on the signal strength in my house out of box but after Apple put out a new patch it improved to 4 bars so hopefully a patch can fix this long term. I think the features overall outweigh the negative hype thrown around on launch day. Bottom line there are always going to be lovers and haters of opposing technology, but regardless of the logo on this device it is a beautiful piece of technology.
i just got my iPhone 4 from Best Buy ...works great!!! Battery life is much better...out the box fully charged 6 hours and at 91%... if you looking for a thin smartphone that does everything ..this is the phone for you.
The iphone 4 is amazing it has a bigger battery and better proccessor.
The iphone 4 is a highly polished prize that most will encounter great difficulty in obtaining now that the doors for purchases have just been opened. The device is 24 percent thinner than that of its predecessor the 3GS, packing the power & capabilities into the new A4 chip allowing the newer model to render HD video capturing on a 5MP flash illuminated camera lens. Furthermore face time via iphone 4- iphone 4 will set an ambiance unknown to communication historically. The fact that the iphone is customized & fashioned using the highest grade alloys & glass makes me wonder.... When will I be able to get mine?
my dad has an iphone 4 which he got 2 days earlier. It really has a MUCH better display.. i mean you literally can't see any pixels... the camera is also great. the quality of the video is like the Flip HD
THIS PHONE BLOWS THE EVO OUT OF THE WATER, APPLE HAS DONE IT AGAIN AND THIS TIME ITS 10 TIMES BETTER THAN EVER. THE VIDEO QUALITY IS UNBELIEVABLE THE FACETIME VIDEO CHAT IS SO EASY TO USE AND IT DOES NOT TAKE UP AND OF YOUR MINUTES. IT IS FAST THE IPHONE FOR IS AT LEAST 30 T0 40 PERCENT FASTER THAN THE 3GS. AND I HAVE NEVER HAD A PROBLEM WITH AT&T SERVICE
Everything works great in this phone. I love it as I think I am using a perfect phone in less price.
iPhone is great but using it with virgin mobile service really brings the phone down. Can't download any apps using 3G must be to slow . Ive talk to tech support they have no clue why i cant download apps usinjg 3g I have to use wifi to download apps . virgin mobile they blame apple store . Yeah right, I tried to post on theire site they reject my review since I was bad mouthing theire service. Still I can stream music fine and use gps service fine . Lucky all the places I hang out the service works except cape may nj certain spots touchy .
As per ALL Apple products the battery life is terrible, but that was to be expected because, after all, it is an Apple. I came from Blackberry, a die hard fan, and (per Apple tradition) there are very few settings you can customize to your liking with the iPhone. I also can't find if it is possible to add a custom dictionary like you can with BB. For instance, with BB you can set it to change "u" to "you" automatically in a text. I can't find that I can do that with iPhone. It is also VERY fragile, which is obvious but still a concern. The battery also heats up, very quickly, when in use but it also cools very quickly when it is back at rest. However, I have really enjoyed this phone and will probably hold onto it for for a while, as an investment phone. The picture quality/screen are AMAZING! The graphics are so crisp!! It is also a very fast phone and I've had no problems with it. I'm falling in love...slowly but surely.
You have to pay a lot of money up front for the phone but in the long run it is cheaper. It will pay for itself in the long run. In about a year. Compared to other cell phone services it is cheap. The phone works great, Good sound and reception. Battery lasts for awhile. Can only get 3G Internet but it does the job.
Finally, a no contract iPhone! I've used other no contract smart phones, and they just cannot compare to the quality of the iPhone.
Love the iPhone, but haven't been able to take advantage of it due to Virgin Mobile's HORRIBLE service. Even though they act so nice, after a month of escalations and no solution, I am still not able to: 1- text 2- use iMessage 3- use FaceTime 4- show how many voice messages I have Buy this phone, but AVOID Virgin Mobile as your provider. The guy in charge of Virgin needs to focus more on his phone company than his spaceship!
The phone was fine but not worth the high cost. I wasn't able to setup SMS paging and called Apple to complain. Apparently that is not a supported capability and I need it for work so .... back went the phone.
The price of the phone is more than offset in the savings on the plan. $35/month can't be touched. Was paying $85+ on Verizon. I get good coverage at home and at work so no complaints there.
Nice case, charges very inconsistently though. Sometimes won't work. Safpwr makes a much better battery case.
I find the case to be excellent in build quality, looks, and overall protection for the iPhone 4. What I don't like is that it doesn't always work. I've tried rebooting the phone, removing and replacing the phone in the case, etc - it's a gamble whether it will work or not. I need reliability, and sadly, this isn't reliable in the least. Like I said,...I loved it - but the romance is over!!! And, TBH, I love this case!!! I may do an exchange, and I'll update accordingly,...for now, it's a ***fail***
Amazing phone with unbelievable possibilities! I love the ease at which I can navigate from screen to screen. Being thousands of miles from home, this phone will help keep me close to my brothers and sisters back home!
I am glad I waited for the price drop for the iPhone. I really like the phone, but there are some things I miss about my Android, such as GPS with voice. For the most part, it is a good phone!
I love the quality of the camera. I only wish it could zoom for close ups, or maybe that's something I haven't figured out yet. I love the convenience of having music, pictures, phone, and reading material all in the palm of my hand. Oh, games as well. There is an app for everything you can think of.
It just works, Needed to call Sprint for plan fix.
Great phone overall. It handles all my business needs.
my husband thinks laptops are toys, so I have my iphone 4 and call it my palmtop. Just like a little laptop, I can do ALMOST anything on the internet. Would prefer if Adobe would get off it and make a flash player that would work on iphone. Without wi-fi, it is as slow as sprint is. With wi-fi it really kicks butt. Hard to get used to the virtual keyboard tho...
Such a great iPhone. Battery life is very short because of all the push notification but still very useful. No complaint at all.
I love this phone. Coming from a slow android phone before this thing is a dream compared to that. It is also very easy to use and cheap too :)
Everyone will soon have a smart phone - the Apple IPhone 4 is the best. Easy to use with no unnecessary bells & whistles.
easy to use, anyone can navigate thru the features without issues
Love the phone! I would recommend this phone to my friends and family.
I love my IPhone. Me and my wife bought matching IPhones. I had been a loyal Android user but my wife encouraged me to try it. I'm glad I did. The OS is extra smooth and the App selection is great. The only down point is ITunes. Like being on restriction.
Overall I like it very much and don't expect to need an upgrade for quite some time.
I love this phone. Didn't think I would like not having a keypad but this just as easy to use.
Best phone ever! I was never a phone junkie but this has completely changed my life!
Really like the device! Its great to mess with, the iphone is a great phhone
its easy to get apps ans surf the web.and while on the phone you can do other stuff
phone has a great look and feel. The sound and picture quality is great. You must love apple products and design to fully appreciate phone. I did have issues with lost connections and dropped calls while using this phone. Also it lagged a bit, even with wifi.
The iPhone is great!!! I really like it except i wish the battery wasn't so short. :(
I never though the could be a device that can do all the things the iphone 4 can. I work full time as a correctional officer and am also a full time college student. Appointment and homework reminders; study music and party tunes; easy messaging; no dropped calls; and many other reasons why I love this phone...it's almost as if apple designed this phone specifically for me.
I like the phone and it has many functions that I enjoy and use a lot. However the battery life on this phone is ridiculously short.
Great product, glad to have added this to my array of apple products
The IPhone makes it possible for me to do so much that I feel like I have a computer and digital camera with me at all times. At times it is easier to use it than open the computer and mess with all that! When we traveled we brought our digital camera but never used it.
My previous two phones were android, extremely disappointed with call quality and battery life was a joke. Switched to iphone and I am still getting used to the awesome battery life. The apps are awesome, and the quality is awesome! I would recommend to this phone to everyone!
over nice phone jsut the headphone not good and had to take in cuz of the problem with headphone slot
This phone can do everything but it is not to complicated like other phones
The iphone is not just nice looking but functional.What sets apple products apart is that they want to make you learn and use technology without complicating your life.The phone takes great pictures for a smartphone,has great sound and it's a breeze to use.
I am so excited that Sprint finally jumped on the iPhone bandwagon! I love this phone!
I owned a first generation iPhone and thought is was junk. The lag on the typing, screen flips, etc made the phone almost unuasable. I then swapped to one of the first droid phones, hoping to have better luck. Sadly, this phone was even worse. When the iPhone 4 came available on Sprint, I decidely to have a look. After messing with one in the store, I decided that they finally got it right. I've had the phone for about a month now and am still as happy as I was the day I purchaed it. Let's face it, these devices are just hand-held computers that happen to make voice calls on a cell network. They actually put enough power into the device to handle the software that is written for it. I can install any available app and it works great. Best phone I've ever used and would highly recomend it to anyone who wants to have a mobile device that can do almost anything your PC can.
Can't believe I waited so long to get one of these . So easy to use and just great in every respect !
My son bought this phone with a life proof case about a month ago. The other day it quit working and won't turn on. I tried to warn him about the high failure rate of I-phones and to get something else with a bigger screen. My wife had an i-phone 4 that broke and wouldn't turn on after 6 months. He didn't listen, so now , back to the store for another one.........I would never own an i-phone, nor would I recommend it. Kids can be hard headed though and want the "in phnone" regardless of it's poor quality record.
Excellent Phone, I am glad I switched from a droid.
I bought this for my son after I had my iphone 4s for about 6 months. I like so much about them I do not know where to start.
I would recommend to somebody with cautions. It's a good phone we not heavy Apple users. If the price wasn't so great would've got the HTC LTE.
Love it! Use it for work and fun. Would never go back to Blackberry after this and I liked my Blackberry. Keeps me organized and on track.
Good for a 10-15 year old kid who wants a cool toy.
I like my new phone, but the upload speed is not fast enough. The phone does not have 4G only 3G.
Daughter came due for an upgrade and decided to get this phone for her freee upgrade - thank you Iphone 5 release to make this phone free. Daughter is loving her phone and says her battery life is great - she doesn't worry about it needing charged through out the day. She has not had any complaints about the phone, the apps, or anything.
Very disappointing. Slow slow slow,my 3 year old smart phone was faster. Podcast app worthless, apple wants control of the phone configuration so not much personalizing. I would say the phone part works great.
I love this product!! As an Apple aficionado, this was the one missing piece and I'm so elated that I finally got it. Everything one has heard about the iphone is on point, people!! Ease of use, picture quality etc. It's just awesome! Get it while you can, people.
This brand has fancy look and false advertising, the packing bluffing how good it's and bla bla bla, but it is nothing could be further than the truth! The design is very stupid: it require you to get your hands wet while applying the sheet on your iPhone - literally. I believe this is the first time in human history that an instruction manual tells you to wet your hand before you touch your electronic product. According to the manual, you will need to spray the liquid (they are just simply water) on your hand and the sheet, and then apply the sheet on your iPhone screen, and eventually get your iPhone wet. I can tell the water went into the space around my home key, and spaces around my screen. Even worse, the sheet is difficult to move and adjust position when attached to the screen, there will be bubbles too. Avoid this product.
The only issue I have with this product is that it is dang near impossible to get all the corners to stick correctly. I have had mine for several months and the back right corner will not stay down.
Sure, this thing was a lot of money to buy. It costs $30 for the front and back skins and then $8 for Best Buy to put it on. But these come with a lifetime warranty, and if the thing ever comes off, you can take it to Best Buy and have someone there install a new one for free (since the $8 is a one time deal), and it's probably being done by someone who has installed hundreds of these things before so you can be sure they know what they are doing. So not only is the reinstallment of the skins on the phone free for as many times as you take it in, but the skins themselves are free after you have bought them once. Well worth the investment
The Invisible Shield by Zagg is the best screen protector I have ever bought to date. The protector gives the screen a gel-like texture that helps with grip and protects from scratching. As with all screen protectors, they can be a bit of a pain to install perfectly but that shouldn't deter you from buying one. Don't think twice of buying one because of all the poor reviews from people whom I assume were too quick to install and therefore too quick to judge. Just take your time and READ THE INSTRUCTIONS! You won't be disappointed!
The screen protectors are great. I have the otter box commuter case and the front and back invisishield on my new iPhone 4s that I'm using to write this review. I never used screen protectors before but I figured since I'm upgrading to the 4s I better go ahead and protect it. They were very easy to put on and I actually liked using the solution it came with. It seemed to do a little better job at gettin the bubbles out of the screen. All in all I would give this a 5 star rating easily. If your considering getting a screen protector, follow the instructions and you will be fine. I bet 50 percent of the bad reviews on protectors are from ppl who don't follow directions.
I was hesitant to spend this much on just a screen protector and even more so to pay to have them install it. But after having the fear of god placed in my head from the sales guys that I would mess it up I bit the bullet and had them install it. About a week into having the screen protector the corners of the screen protector started picking up a gross, dirt looking color, yellowish brown. I shower every day, wash my hand multiple times a day and so to have this discolor so soon made me crazy. I have the white iPhone, so if you have the black one, you would probably not ever notice this. Read on zagg to use their install solution to clean the protector, I did, nothing happened. The screen protector is permanently stained... I figured since I had such a bad experience I could return it to best buy here, BUT they informed me that I couldn't and the only way I could get a refund is to send it back to zagg, pay the shipping, wait for the new one to come and return it. O' and that rip to install it, yeah, non-refundable. Go with your gut, this is too expensive and too good to be true and if they make it so hard to install that you have to pay someone to do it for you, it really isn't worth it. Here is your answer, NO! Please don't make the same mistake I did. Go with Otterbox, you just snap it in it's case, screen protector built in. I can't believe I got sucked in...but with not a lot of other options I felt this HAD to be the best right since it took up more than half of the wall space on in the store. O' how wrong I was. The picture below is after I just cleaned it. O' and that same nice customer service I got while paying them to install it was quickly taken away when I was told to pay zagg more money to have best buy return it. Ugh!!!
After putting the Invisible Shield over my new IPhone, the screen is not very responsive and more over when u put it in pocket the shield tends to come out.
Can't wait until I return it! Tried it several times - didn't stick, it scratched, bubbled, etc. Even after waiting 24 hours. I have a HTC Incredible 2. BTW. I'm an engineer with a Masrer's Degree.
Considering this is a "military grade" film, I have lost faith in the military due to the poor quality of this. Not scratch proof by any means and definitely a smudge magnet. Additionally, the instructions provided are horrible and don't even suggest cleaning the device before you apply this "military grade" film.
I choked down the 30.00 purchase price due to the lifetime warranty. After the protective cover started coming up at the edges after about 9 months it looked as if the warranty was in affect. The catch is that they still charge $4.00 to $51.00 for shipping and handling depending on which option you chose. There is NO option to avoid these charges by going to best buy to get a replacement. So even for the replacement these guys are making more money beyond the huge profit from the original purchase. USPS shipping for this small item would be less than 2.00 at worst. I have gone back to the 5 covers for $4.00 that I can replace every 6 months and still come out way ahead in the long run. Best Buy... Pay attention and offer other alternatives. Thank you
You would think there would be something special considering these are $30, but you'd be wrong. First of all, the magic spray bottle, or whatever it is, came empty. It was nearly impossible to get the protector off the backing..I had to slide a knife between it and the backing. Even barely touching the very corners left fingerprints, and all I can say is bubbles galore. If you want a better front and back protector, look at Power Support USA's Crystal or Antiglare films. Their crystal film is almost unnoticeable on the retina display. They are around $15 and you get TWO back protectors and a screen protector.
I purchased the full body protector for my I phone had Best Buy install it for me.They did a great job on it. If it is installed correctly it is a very nice piece no complaints,
The water base solution that was provided in a mini bottle was dried out. After attempting to apply the face sheild, I had many problems with the alignment. I used the rubber squeegee to force out any bubbles, and caused me to stretch the sheild. Which of course made it to long for the phone and the alignment didn't match. That was a faliure, but I attempted putting on the back sheild with alittle more success. Unfortunately, after placing the phone in my pocket multiple times the edges started to come up and attrack the lent in my pocket. For paying $30.00, I am very upset.
I just bought it today after reading a bunch of reviews about how hard it was to install it. That's not true....its simple to install and once it fully dries, it looks really nice and actually makes the screen a lil clearer. Best Buy offers to install it for $8 but hey, if I can put it on, ANYBODY can! Definitely worth the money. Also, if u put it on urself and it doesn't turn out right, Best Buy will let u exchange it and then u can just give them the $8 to do it or, just get ur money back
This is my 4th Invisishield, and I am a fan! I put one on my wife's Droid, I had one on my Droid, I have one on my iPad, and I recently added this product to my iPhone. I think the people who are rating it so low are having a hard time installing it. I admittedly had a hard time with my first one, but I learned a trick: First thing to do is throw away that spray bottle. Get a bowl of water, and put a drop or two of liquid dish soap in it. You can apply the mixture with your finger, or dip the whole protector into it before beginning. It will work wonders. I NEVER have air bubbles, and you can actually lay the screen protector flat and manipulate it until you get it just right. The only reason I gave 4 instead of 5 stars is because it was $30, and at $30, they should not forget the microfiber cloth.
Very easy to install and stays on. Have had great service out of it.
Film makes high retina display on iphone look terrible. Way overpriced...wouldnt mind paying if it actually worked...didnt have any troubles with same product on my Droid but its definitely not good on iphone.
Let me start by saying this is my second Zagg install. My first was with the iPod Touch 4th generation. I bought the full body and while, like all Zagg products, it was difficult to get on, I did manage to do it perfectly. This today...oh boy. First of all it didn't come with the microfiber cloth. Not sure why, but luckily I had one on hand that I used for the iPod Touch. You'd think for over $30 with tax though, this thing would have all the necessities. I am writing to the company about it. Secondly, I don't know if they have changed it or what but the picture shows indvidual cut out holes for things like the camera and speaker, and the camera and flash. Mine was not like that. Mine had a giant hole for each. While I tried hard to line it up and get it perfect, part of the skin is overlapping on the silver ring around the back camera. I also noticed the Zagg skin that is supposedly "precition cut" for each individual device doesn't seem to be so. I have quite a gap all the way around the phone. Most noticeably arond the home button. It does have a small hole cut out, then a small ring cut out, so I'm not sure what that's about, if you're supposed to use the ring as well or what? Why not just have the hole the size of the actual home button. Also with this one, I have a significant amount of bubbling around the whole phone. When I did the iPod Touch it was perfect, this thing looks really bad right now but they say it will work itself out in a few days so I'm hoping that is so. Worst part about this, and it's not just this particular one, but all Zagg skins from what I hear and read is they don't go to the exact edge of the phone screens so any rubbery case you put on it pushes on the eges and lifts it up letting in dust and leading to it no longer sticking, looks like junk and doesn't protect your phone. Luckly Zagg has a lifetime replacement policy, but you still have to pay shipping, as well as mail the current "damaged" one you have on your phone back. I also saw that they have a claim where you can get a new one if they remove the skin to repair your phone, so that is really considerate of them. The cases could also be to blame, but for the price of this and the fact that they claim to be precision cut is what angers me. Also I have scratched them with just my fingernail, so when they say they don't really scratch, they definitely do, BUT it protects your phone and they replace it if scratched so it's kind of hard to complain about that.
The only thing I don't like is the fact that my case doesn't go on easy with the extra layer of film on it. The lady didn't tell me that I probably didn't need it since I bought a really durable case.
I got my iPhone 4 on the second launch day and have been highly obsessed ever since. When I purchased my first Zagg protectors, I had them on for about 3 months, until I accidentally sprayed cologne towards the iPhone and it covered the front protector in sparkling looking dots. But before that had happened, I must say, they are fantastic protectors. Not a scratch on the back or front (no case on the back, just the bumper). I purchased about 5 other Zagg protection orders for several different reasons, one being that I could never get it on without dust/lint under the protector...I love my iPhone and want these protectors on perfectly (and I do feel the need for the protectors on the iPhone; it's not immune to scratches, but does hold up well) but could never get it on flawlessly. So a friend told me that Best Buy would install them for a small extra charge, so I went there. Well, hoping it would turn out perfect, it didn't... I have small specs of dust everywhere, little lines running up and down the protector, and what I think is the installers finger print smudge on it since he didn't use the application spray on his hands. After 2 days of usage, my white iPhone 4 Bumper is starting to push up the edges but after reading these reviews now knowing I should wait a day or so to let the protectors settle, I'll wait a day or so until I use the new ones heavily or put a case/bumper on it (I didn't experience this with my other Zagg protectors and bumper...). So hopefully I'll be going up to Best Buy in the next day or so so they can replace and re-install it for free. I just can't win with these things, so I pray for a break!!! I'll write a new review after I get the new ones on! Wish me luck for perfect protectors!!!
I've been using the same ZAGG screen protector for my Iphone for close to 3 1/2 months now and I must say that it's definitely the best screen protector out there. Not only is it a perfect fit but when installed properly it does not come off easy. My screen gets dirty from time to time but there's never a permanent stain that does not wipe off easily. As long as you follow the instructions and make sure your fingers are clean and the surface of the phone is free of dust you should have no problems installing it. Make sure you spray your fingers, the phone, and the invisishield thoroughly so you can position it perfect on your phone before using the squeegy to clean out the bubbles. The remaining small bubbles will disappear once the phone is completely dry!
I purchased this product and found it extremely difficult to install correctly. It comes with some liquid and a black cardboard sqeege which is supposed to remove the bubbles that, guaranteed, will form on installing. The product is so thin and sticky that it is next to impossible to slide it (as the instructions say) after applying it to the glass, in spite of the liquid application. I also found the supplied cardboard "squeege" useless in removing the bubbles. The product is also quite expensive. When I attempted to get a warranty replacement to make another attempt to install, Zagg wanted my credit card so they could charge me, for what they deem as return "shipping and handling". I do not recommend this product.
Great product. I love it until I found out that I got charges $5 more than if I got it direct. Tomorrow I am going to give them a piece of my mind :D
I bought this thinking it was going to be great. They boasted the military grade plastic. Well it was a pain to put on. The spray they give you sometimes gets into your earpiece hole and I don't think moisture should get in there but it's the only way to apply it. Then if your phone gets warm the screen protector slides around because it uses a light adhesive instead of static like every other iphone protector. I was so disappointed. To top it off once it comes off on the edges after it gets warm, which it will, then the lint in your pocket sticks to it and it will never come off. Because of the adhesive you cant wipe it off like other screen protectors so you just have to throw it away. Complete waste of money
I have read multiple reviews, both good and bad. It was not to hard to install, just follow directions. Once it was on it is great. It does show finger prints easily, just wipe it off. I can see that "orange peel" look, only when I really look for it, and at angles that I would even use the phone for. Light has to shine on it and viewed almost horizontally. I did have micro bubble that I could not get out. It did go away in a day, now it's perfect. I originally had vertical lines in my screen. I took it off and realized it was the protector. I scratched the case when installing. It was a pain to take off, but all I had to do was take my finger and peel a corner. Once I did that, it came off very easy, and left no residue on the screen. I ordered a replacement for $3.99 and it arrived at few days later. I put a new one on, now it's flawless. The lifetime warranty is great, and cheap..
The Zagg screen protector began peeling at the edges within a week. Once the iphone cover was added to eliminate phone reception issues, the screen peels and bubbles constantly. For the amount of money spent on this, I'd expect it to be compatible with all phone covers. Save your money and buy a cheap, non-shrinking screen cover. That way, when they have to be replaced often, you're not out so much money.
Is a good shield for Iphone 4, i would like tohave more liquid to put to the shield but its Ok.
Zagg makes a great product, but it is pricey. I have installed these on my iPhone 3GS, iPad and most recently on iPhone 4. Make sure your hands are squeaky clean, and spray you fingers, the device and both sides of the protector with the supplied spray. I had issues with the corners peeling on the iPhone 4. The issue was with a film on the glass, not with the screen protector. Swab off the glass with alcohol (lightly), and let it evaporate prior to installing the shield... problem solved. This is quite easy to apply after you have done it a couple of times, but you can screw it up quite easily. If unsure, pay the $10 bucks to have it done. Once applied, don't mess with it... leave it overnight and you're golden.
This is an invaluable product to have on your phone which is basically a $200/$300 piece of glass. And for those who are worried about having a hard time for the installation, there's a lot of videos on YouTube demonstrating how to do it properly. I bought a full body version for the iPad and a front-only for the iPhone. As long as you follow instructions and leave your device alone for 12 hours after installing, you should be ok. Aside from protecting the surfaces, it also adds a more tactile feel to it and makes it not as slippery when you're holding it in your hand without any sort of case.
Although this shield is thicker than others, you pay for it with less screen clarity and noticeably less screen sensitivity. I've also experienced the edges peeling off like others have noted. I've installed several of these types of shields, and followed the instructions (as well as hints from others online) and it still peels. As soon as I get my free bumper from Apple, I'll be buying a screen protector from another company.
A friend of mine had this on his 3G and it looked great after a year. At one point it fell out of his pocket going 75 mph on his bike and protected the screen, not a scratch. He told me the only negative was that its hard to install and it looks very bubbly right after you install but give it a day or two and the micro bubbles will settle out and it looks awesome. I have now installed 2 of these protectors on iPhone 4's both front and back and can say that you need to read the directions wash your hands well and keep your hands and the protector very wet, make sure you use enough of the solution. Use the squeegee and get all the big bubbles out, there will be micro bubbles, they will settle out, once its had time to settle it looks great. I have used 5 different screen protectors between 3 different iPhones and i can say i wish i had bought this in the first place for each one, i was intimidated by the installation, but in the end did a great job once i tried it out. The only negative is that it feels pretty rubbery, which takes some getting used to. But of all the protectors once i got it on it looked the best. Oh and be careful not to get finger prints on the application side. Overall i would say that those complaining about it simply didn't read the directions or never gave it time to properly seat, the directions say minimum 24 hours of not using your phone and up to 3 days for all micro bubbles to settle out.
Many days left alone for drying. Even purchased twice for a second chance. However fine and lasted two years on my old iPhone 3G.
I bought this screen protector a couple of days ago for my new iPhone and so far so good. The only problem I had was installing it. It took me several times to finlly get it one right. Plus you need to make sure that no dust particles get onto the screen because it will show and will annoy most people. I recommend if you don't have the patience to get it installed by a rep. I recommend getting this even if you plan or already have a case for your phone. Once it's installed properly, you can't even tell it's on your phone and it doesn't weaken the retina display. The only thing I didn't like was the price because you know it probably cost less than 2 dollars to make this screen protector. But if you care for your new iPhone and want to keep it looking new for as long as you have it, this is the best protector on the market.
Love it! I use my iPhone for everything, even taking before and after pics while I am working on my classic car. The cover protects my car from the grease, grime and keeps it scratch free.
I never write reviews but just wasted a ton of time on this and don't want anyone else to do the same. I thought I was smart getting the most expensive protector for my new iPhone but obviously I should have gotten the standard 3-pack type with the easy appliacation. I agree wholeheartedly with all the 1 star reviews and most of the 5 star reviews of this product are written in a language that sound suspiciously like they could have been written by the Invisble Shield marketing people. I have installed many screen protectors with no issues, I'm not new to this. The application is impossible and when you're done you have a ton of little bubbles, the feel is very tacky/sticky , the texture is like an orange peel and it peels off very easily. The feel of the product overall is like one of those cheap plastic decals that stick to windows that you can easily peel right off. Going to get my $30 back tomorrow.
I have owned all versions of the IPhone and struggled with the cheaper film screens. When I purchased my Bumper for my Iphone 4 the tech at the Apple store said I won't need a film screen for the phone. Rather than risking finger prints and dropping the phone and scratching up the glass I decided to check out the full body shield. I had Best buy installed it for me, the tech was great. She did in no time flat with no bubbles. The key is to leave the phone off for about 45 minutes after installation and leave the case or bumper off for 24 hours to let everything set. I purchased this in July as soon as I got my phone and I wipe the fingerprints off every now and then with a cloth that you use for eyeglasses. No peels, no cracks and no rollups. It does not take away from the resolution of the Iphone 4. It's by far the best screen out there. The best part is the lifetime warranty so you can always get replacements.
!!! Extremely easy to apply !!! I've bought a screen protector for every iPhone I've bought! (3 so far) I (like everyone else in the cell phone era) use my cell phone a lot! So, having oily finger prints, dust & dirt on my iPhone just won't do! The military grade scratch resistance, for this highly used iPhone is a must! Great product does everything it says it does at a price cheaper than ones I've bought before! You need to be like 'Nike' on this one... (Just Do It)
PROS: nicely packaged, looks great on phone, very strong material CONS: even though the cover is pre-cut you still have to remove pieces of plastic for the buttons which can be tedious. I installed mine and it looked great, none of the edges frailed up. 3 days later, the edges peeled up. If you put the phone in your pocket, lint WILL work its way between the glass and Zagg cover I would not recommend this product. The same thing happened to my friend that bought one.
THIS SCREEN PROTECTOR IS THE BEST IT LOOKS GREAT ON THE PHONE AND THE PROTECTION IS UNBEATABLE. NOW YOU MUST REALIZE IT TAKES A STEADY HAND TO INSTALL THIS AND YOU REALLY HAVE TO WET YOUR HANDS WITH THE SOLUTION OR YOU WILL GET FINGER PRINTS ON THE SCREEN PROTECTOR OTHER THAN THAT VERY EASY TO INSTALL. PLUS IT HAS A LIFE TIME WARRANTY I GOT MY IPHONE 4 AND PUT IT ON AND THAN NOTICES THERE WAS SOME YELLOW STAIN ON THE IPHONE I TOOK IT IN TO THE APPLE STORE AND THEY GAVE ME A NEW PHONE I THAN CALLED ZAGG AND THEY SENT ME A REPLACEMENT SCREEN PROTECTOR FREE OF CHARGE BECAUSE OF THE LIFETIME WARRANTY UNLIKE THE OTHER PROTECTORS THAT YOU WOULD HAVE TO PAY FOR AGAIN
I purchased this iPhone4 screen protector at Best Buy because the brand I had on my 3GS wasn't available at the time. I really regret it. It was very difficult to install. This is my 4th iPhone and I have had screen protectors on all of them and his was by far the hardest to install. After the install it looked horrible, after a few days it was better, but still diminished the fabulous screen on the iPhone4. Now that Power Support released their Crystal Film for the iPhone4 I removed this and installed that. Much better product, almost invisible unlike this "invisible shield" which looks awful! Don't waste your money! I wish I had waited for the Power Support Crystal Film Set to come out so I didn't waste my $32.74!!!
This is a MUST to have on anything you can stick on.
Judging from the videos on their website and the thickness of the material, it'd be a great product. That is if you could actually get it on the first time correctly. Drop it, get dust on it, one fingerprint, etc and you're hosed. I took all the proper precautions but still wouldn't stick to the edges. Every case I tried peeled up the edges. Has a very "sticky" feeling to the face as well so dust/papers/even bugs get stuck to the screen. Finally returned it and got the $15 3pack and haven't looked back.
It had that orange peel look, but that was not the issue. I had it in my pocket one day with a reciept. The reciept somehow stuck to the adhesive side of the shield and lifted it up then stuck to the paper! Its hard to get a right fit because of that tiny ridge that the iPhone 4 has on the border. If you have any piece of the shield on that border, you're hosed. I wasted $40 (including install) and cant get my money back. Buyer beware!
I had BestBuy install the screen protector on my iPhone 4 for $12 (front and back) because I'd seen co-workers struggle for weeks trying to get bubbles out. The end result is that it was perfectly installed and works beautifully. It hasn't scratched yet.
Purchased this to protect the front and back of my iphone 4. I was able to get it installed correctly and was able to get all of the bubbles out. However, I carry my phone in my pocket and after just a week, the back cover started to peel off. Tried reapplying the solution provided but that didn't help. $30 wasted. I have had iphones for years and have never had a problem with other screen protectors. They will usually last me 6 months or more before they need to be replaced. At $10 - $15 for pack of 3, that's not bad. But this one at $30 for 1 and only lasts a week... never again.
Do not provide protection to your phone just to the screen! And is too expensive!
I got Best Buy to install this product for me, so there were no bubbles in the film. It also was virtually transparent when using the device. As some have mentioned, it is a bit tacky (sticky) after the initial application, but this has aided in making the device easier to hold; it also wears off slightly over time. I really like the fact that this product is covered by a lifetime guarantee. I had to get a replacement phone, and the company shipped out a replacement within two days of requesting a replacement. This case is perfect for anyone who doesn't want to lose the aesthetics of the device and still have good protection.
I bought the iFrogz and the Invisible Shield full body screen protector for my iPhone 4. This combination works well. Installation of the Invisible Shield is fairly easy. I highly recommend watching the installation videos on Zagg's website. When I purchased my Invisible Shield for the iPad, it took me a while to install. I then watched the videos and realized that I didn't spray enough water onto the adhesive side. Also, don't try to squeegee out all of the bubbles. The small bubbles will work themselves out over a few days. Another note: what's not clear in the description is that this is the front and back screen protectors only. Zagg has another full-body kit that also covers the side.
This shield is amazing with how well it protects. I don't even hesitate putting my phone in my pocket with change and keys in there, or laying it on hard, rough surfaces. I have a home-made stylus for it tipped with aluminum foil and use it without fear. Afterall, if it does scratch the protector I get it replaced for free. If you want the best protection possible without a bulky case - this is the way to go. I've used this product on my last 2 iphones and also my ipad. When installing it, read the instructions! All of the poor reviews here seem like they missed a point in the instructions. *Wet both sides of the film thoroughly = easy to align *WET YOUR HANDS = no fingerprints *The materail stretches and compresses, keep the edge of the film a couple mm from the edge of the screen = no peeling (even the corners) *wet the squeegee = no marks on the film *dont worry about bubbles, the material breaths so bubbles and haziness (adhesive) work themselves out over a couple days and the film becomes crystal clear. *if you do mess it up, it isn't a loss - let it dry then reapply. If all else fails take it to a zagg store (in malls all over) and they'll fix/replace it for free.
I went out on a limb and bought two of ZAGG's products. The iPhone 4 front/back cover and their iPad screen protector. Both products I would review the same...poor. I've used several brands of screen covers on my old iPhone 3G and comparatively speaking, the ZAGG product is lacking in several areas. First of all, the cover looks "grainy" (almost like leather) and takes away from the nice, smooth look of your iPhone. You can see the grains as you look at your screen straight on which is unfortunate. Secondly, the cover is thick and soft compared to other brands, and is nearly impossible to put on without tiny bubbles (and I mean tiny) underneath certain parts of it. I would describe it as "fizz" from a soda can. You can lift and reapply it and, occasionally, it goes away, but if you look closely, they are everywhere. It makes no difference how much you squeegee them, either. Lastly, as I mentioned earlier, the ZAGG protection covers just look terrible on the phone. They really do. I buy Apple products because of their asthetics and clean look. Unfortunately, after putting the ZAGG protectors on my phone, it now looks like I glued two pieces of clear leather on each side of it. My iPad looks even worse with the larger screen.
I have been reading stories and video of how some Best Buy iPhone 4 skins installations have not gone well for some people. I went to the Norwalk, CT location yesterday and was helped by a mobile associate named Imran. (Forgive my spelling) He was firendly and did an outstanding job installing the Zagg Invisible Shield on my iPhone 4. What's good about the company is that Zagg offers a lifetime warranty for the life of the phone. Take your iPhone to Best Buy in Norwalk, CT.
I don't normally write reviews. But as for yesterday I wasted 20+ dollars on buying this Invisible C**p by ZAGG. Three hours of bubbles removing, and ended up throwing it away! ! ! A Total Waste of Money! You might is well take out 20+ dollars and burn it ! The shield material is too soft, and that's why it's collecting tiny pocket of air / bubbles. If you use the squeegee too hard you will end up ripping or cause marks on the plastic shield. Fingerprints collecting too as you are putting this c**p shield on your iPhone. Also this shield material will also collect lint, because it feels kinda sticky. The BEST film I've used for my iPhones so far is Crystal Film by Power Support. I don't know why Mac Store don't carry the Crystal Film by Power Support this time.
Lasted only a day before it started rolling up on itself. Easy to install and worked fine until I slid the Iphone into a leather case. If you slide the phone into anything that is slightly snug at all like a pocket or case the edge on the shield will just roll up on itself and then it is basically trash. Might be worth $2-3 but not $30. Sure it has a guarantee, but don't want another one. Total waste of money.
In my opinion this is one of the better screen protectors on the market. I have bought this product in the past for my 3G. The price is expensive when compared to other screen protectors, but how many of them come with a lifetime guarantee? I've had one for my 3G for 2 years and only needed to replace it once. This was due to me getting the protector dirty after trying to remove the screen protector, but Zagg replaced it free of charge so I considered it a good investment. My 3G still looks brand new even after 2 years of use. Therefore, I see no reason why this product should be any different now that i have upgraded my phone to a iPhone 4. Installation is not easier for beginners. My advice, read the instructions before attempting to install. As a tip - make sure you spray your fingers, the phone screen and the protector, this will make the installation a little easier in order to align the protector correctly. Worst case scenario pay Best Buy to install it for you.
I've installed a variety of these shields on my gadgets over the past few years and I just finished installing the front/back shields on my iPhone 4. Perfect installation and no discoloring. Improper or rushed installation is probably the primary source of dissatisfaction. This is really easy to install if you follow instructions and take it very slowly. The key is wetting your fingers and the front and back of the sheet before you place it on the phone. Once you place it on, you can fine tune the placement by sliding it around. Don't worry about frying your gadget with the solution - just turn it off and remove the excess water as you squeegee. Another helpful hint to try to remove the cut-outs while it's still on the white sheet.
I just traded in my iPhone 3G for the beautiful new iPhone 4. For two years I had the same screen protector (Power Support brand) I bought from Apple on the old iPhone and it protected my screen perfectly at a cost of $14.99 for 3 protectors (I sold the other two with the used iPhone!). So, I figured I was getting something better with the Zagg InvisibleSHIELD due to its price. Installation was not as difficult as some reviewers are stating - mine went on just fine and after a day or two (as stated in the instructions) any tiny bubbles that were trapped under the shield upon installation were gone. It also aligned with the phone perfectly - I think that some people are inadvertently stretching the shield during installation. Here come the negatives: It is true that the surface has an orange-peel texture to it. In addition, the surface is a bit tacky - it has a rubber-like feel that prevents your fingers from gliding nicely over the touch screen. Worst of all - there are very fine, vertical rainbow-like lines that I believe are in the adhesive. These lines cause a very strange distortion when looking at the screen. This distortion is subtle, but believe me (I'm a designer/photographer) they are there and due to the iPhone 4's new very fine pixel structure, this mini-prism-like effect is multiplied - giving the screen a low-res look - totally negating this great new feature of the phone. I am not the only one who noticed this with this product - you can google 'zagg rainbow lines'. The positives: I'm pretty darn sure that thing will protect your screen no matter what you throw at it... but it will detract from your enjoyment of this incredible device.
i got this shield because everyone recommended it. too much packaging for a low quality product. the cuts of the shield are poorly done, it seams like it was cut by hand. then the actual shield, the film, had a horrible orange peel, it made the iphone look horrible and you are not able to enjoy the gorgeous screen. overall pretty bad product, i'm going to best buy to get a refund because $30 can be better spent on an actual case
Pay for the installation (totally worth it!). The negative commenters probably self-installed their Invisible Shield. I tried to help a friend self-install after I raved about how great the product was, and it just didn't turn out well... Bubbles, dust particles, crooked... But, he got a free replacement after 1 month and then paid BB to install. My first Zagg Invisible Shield was my iPhone 3G. It delivered on every promise! It saved my phone from countless scratches, and I swear it even helped to cushion the many times I dropped it. After 13 months the edges of Invisible Shield had started peeling and gathering dust, so I took advantage of the full warranty and had it replaced for free. In a nutshell - HIGHLY Recommended if you're willing to pay for the install. NOT Recommended if you're going to self-install.
I just wrote this great review of this product and how terrible BAD it is, but Best Buy has a timeout so ALL was lost. In my frustration, I'm writing something short and sweet. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. IT IS TERRIBLE. DO NOT SPEND EXTRA MONEY TO HAVE IT PROFESSIONALLY INSTALLED. Instead, buy one of the other screen protectors that has a hard plastic surface. The Zagg Invisible Shield is NOT invisible and has a orange peel like surface texture, and if you put it into your pocket, your keys and whatever else will imprint into the surface for a short time which dramatically detracts from the elegant beauty of the iPhone 4. It also collects lint, dust and other debris which can be VERY difficult to remove, often requiring water. Water is also included for the installation process, but is very dangerous to the phone, and I worry that some people may inadvertantly ruin their phones. The protective skins constantly bubble up and peel, collecting more lint and debris. It's just awful. My overall experience with this product has been terrible, and I'll be returning it in the next day or two whenever I can get over to BB to return it. If I could, I would give this product a 0 out of 5 stars instead of a 1 of 5. In my opinion, it's really THAT BAD! Not in ANY way worth $30 dollars, and no more than $10. Other screen protects are $20 dollars for 3! I could not in any way give this product a positive review in light of my experience without my conscience taking a huge hit. Sorry Zagg, but this product is a dismal failure.
This is the third time I've attempted to use one of these on one of my devices. The other two were dismal failures, with dust, bubbles, peeling corners, etc. THIS time however, after purchasing my new iPhone 4 - I Paid best buy $13 to install it for me - and it works awesome! No bubbles, peels, problems... Just does what it's supposed to do. Even though I've only had my new phone a few days shy of a week - it's been a great investment - I'm reasonably hard on phones and so far this one has remained scratch free despite coins, keys, etc. being introduced to both sides of my device. Do yourself a favor, it adds a bit to the price, but is well worth having it professionally installed. My wife and mother-in-law also had theirs installed on their new iPhones and have had no issues....
I wanted to make sure my Iphone 4 was scratch free for as long as possible so I purchased the "ZAGG InvisibleSHIELD". First of all the front plastic wasn't even cut right, the home button was semi covered. Then after a few days in my pocket the bottom started rolling off and collecting lint. I have now cleaned and reapplied the front twice in under a week. For $30 this is not good.
It might have great durability but good luck installing it correctly, it stretches pretty easliy and after installing it on my phone 48 hours later a bunch of lint got under the film from being in my pocket and rendered it useless. At least they warrently it, right? Ask my Rep @ AT&T about them and he offered the last customer a refund after the Rep tried to install it and failed as well.
I have used several other screen protectors before and this was by far the worst one. It is made of a stretchy jelly like material that is IMPOSSIBLE to position correctly without bubbles under it. Even when I finally got it positioned correctly (still with a thousand bubbles) there was a very slight overhand from the edge of the glass. They didnt even cut the screen the right size...wow. I do not understand how such a bad product can be sold to consumers. T
These are by far the best looking and most durable screen protectors out there. Most of the negative feedback I've read is with the installation. You really need to take your time and use a generous amount of the spray on your hands and on the adhesive side of the protector film. You want it real wet so when you place it on the screen you can slide it around without having to peel it up to reposition each time. Also, make sure you have every spec of dust off of the glass screen before placing the protector on. I keep a can of air dust remover close by and blow every spec of dust off right before I place the protector on. It's easy to get it on perfect if you follow these steps. I bought the front protector only but now I wish I had gotten the back protector too. Too bad they don't sell the back separate. Now I have to buy a full coverage kit to get the back piece. Looks much nicer and sleeker using the protectors instead of bulking up the phone and giving it a cheap look putting it in a case.
It's not a great cover. Should have spent 10 more bucks!
Bought this for my boyfriend. He uses his phone all the time for work and personal. This case keeps it safe and protects it from scratchs. Excellent product.
Nice case and colors. Good non-slip grip. Good protection for my iPhone.
I bought this to replace another Iphone cover that lasted about 9 months. This cover is far more durable than others and worth the extra money. It is not as bulky as the larger Otter Box covers so I don't expect it to protect the phone like the larger bulkier models. It has flaps that protect the power slot and the bottons and plugs on top from dust that seem difficult at first until you get used to them. Good solid protection for a moderately abused phone.
I have never owned an iPhone before this phone so I am pleasantly surprised. I was very hyped up to buy this phone. Coming from using a BlackBerry for around 5 years. From the 8310 all the way up to the torch. The display is very clear & vivid. The OS is quick, responsive to touch and does not lag. It has never frozen or caused me any trouble. Everything is easy to use. iTunes and iCloud are a bit of a disappointment. I was able to use my BB as an external hard drive. iPhone needs to be sync'd in order to obtain files. There are thousands of apps to choose from and are generally very helpful. Honestly I can find nothing wrong with this phone at all aside for the battery life for a heavy user. My phone is plugged in a good part of the day so battery life is great. Data is fast, great camera, vivid screen, and over all feels very well built. Overall a great phone.
This is a great phone that offers a lot of functionality. There are apps out there for almost anything you could ever need to do, and tons of them are free. The user interface is very simple to figure out - even my mother can use it. There are a few drawbacks though. For one thing, I absolutely hate iTunes. I feel this program is probably the weak link in Apple's chain of otherwise wonderful smartphone. Another thing that can be troublesome is the auto correct feature. While this service is usually helpful it can also be an annoyance when it changes things incorrectly. Also, the battery doesn't last forever, but that's to be expected with any smartphone and the battery life is still seemingly years longer than that of most Android phones. Overall, I think this is a great phone that both techies and noobs can embrace.
Got this to replace my Samsung Impression (which I hated) and 5-yr old banged-up iPod Classic. I am very happy with this iPhone! Very easy to use and has plenty of space for songs, apps, photos, etc.
This phone is noticeably faster than the 3GS. The display is really improved.
When I hold this phone it just feels good. It's solid and easy for me to use. The glass front and back with steel band around the perimeter exudes class. I have this phone with me all the time and it replaces my computer in useful ways. It plays movies, music, podcasts. It records video, takes pictures and records sound. It even talks to me in sometimes silly ways. I asked Siri the other day to name Snow Whites' Seven Dwarfs. It replied, "The Seven Dwarfs". How rich is that? Overall, I'm happy I bought this phone. I talk, it listens. It talks, I listen. What a partnership!
This is an incredible smart phone. Fast, easy to use and it just works. Incredible amount of apps to chose from. A few minor glitches with it hanging, but just turn the phone off, turn it back on and all is well. Why would anyone want anything different? Apple has perfected the simple and effortless user experience, including the ability to plug this into your Mac and transfer everything over is a snap.
Great phone really keeps things organized. It is a great step up from 3GS
I love this phone! I get much longer battery life than I ever did with my 3G. The picture quality is awesome and its MUCH faster downloads. It doesnt drop calls all the time like my 3G did on a daily basis. The only things to complain about is that the battery gets really hot when charging and Siri is useless. It doesnt understand me when I talk and English is my only language. I dont have any accents like a southern accent etc. The only thing it will find is a massage parlor in Fresno lol.
The phone works great, no problems. Very speedy and easy to use.
battery life on this phone seems to exhaust faster than my older 3gs would have been a better deal but was not informed of promotions on all other phones available for my ATT upgrade
Easy to use, and intuitive to navigate around. This phone has oodles of space for photos, videos and apps. Siri is amusing to use, but needs a lot of help in understanding some of what I say... Acronyms are pretty much a lost cause - but I have not used it that much. Power lasts well if WiFi, Location Services and Bluetooth are turned off; otherwise it seems hit or miss. Maybe it depends on the strength of the signal. This is the first smart phone I have used, the last device coming anywhere near it was a Sony Clie - short battery life and loss of power leading to loss of data killed that for me. I feel organised and in control of my life with the iPhone. It connects easily to car and hearing aid bluetooth devices and switches between them on the fly as I get out of, or into my car; the only complaint here is that you cannot name each device - my wife and I both have Fords with Sync - they each appear as 'Sync' in the list - not a problem with 2, but if I rent cars I have to remember to delete the appropriate one each time. I have only had it a month, but would not be without it...
It has a lot of nice features over my 3GS. However the battery life is still not that good. I start to run low after using it all day and sometimes completely drain the battery by 7:00 or 8:00 PM.
First, about BestBuy Mobile: Absolutely the best. And they were able to save my old unlimited data plan, an option which AT&T didn't tell me existed! Pro: Much faster response; much greater memory available; good camera; download speeds (on AT&T) are much faster than straight 3G (almost 4G). Con: Still prone to freezes, lockups, and app crashes; voice quality lagging behind the phones that once were (Motorola StarTac, etc.); AT&T service (bars, ability to access data network in busy locations, etc.) still seems to lag behind iPhone users on Verizon or Sprint. Conclusion: Glad I have it, but, like most high tech devices these days, it's a bit buggy, and AT&T still has some work to do.
This is the best phone out there. Period. It does everything.
The iPhone 4S is really a great phone but there are some weird issues. For example- Facetime sound sometimes just stops working and the fix is to turn the iPhone off and back on (what is it a windows bug?) The only other issue I have is probably with AT&T and not the phone but I keep dropping calls.
i delayed getting an iPhone until now, because I was afraid to go to a touchscreen keypad and had been accustomed to my BlackBerry tactile keyboard. I will get over the typing mistakes because I absolutely love everything about this phone. I bought an iPad about 6 months ago, so this was almost a seamless transition. The iPhone has all the same functionality plus telephone capability, so what's not to like? In my case, I also have a MacBook Pro as my computer, so the three integrate and talk to each other very well, thanks to the iCloud improvements. The camera is great and easy to use and the Siri assistant works well, also.
This is my third iPhone and I have had no problems with any of them except for one, 3gs with bad gps chip worked fine after exchange. So if you are going to spend the money buy something that works. Don't waste it on the other guys like android a friend is on her 7 android and it is still malfunctioning maybe it is just sprint.
Easy to use and is faster than the iPhone 3GS I had before this purchase. Recommend it and Best Buy for purchase to everyone.
This phone was a replacement for my iPhone 4. It suffered an unfortunate accident and had to be replaced. This phone does not seem any faster, and Siri is hit and mostly miss. My biggest concern is the battery life which drains MUCH faster than its predecessor. So, overall it's the same phone I had, but with worse battery life. wooo ....
do you expect anything less than the best from apple... it is an awesome phone... an awesome toy... and i love suri... so do my grandkids... lol..
I had an iPhone 4 and was going to wait on the 5. Then I read it will probably be later in 2012, so I opted to get the 4s 64GB. I use Siri constantly and I use the large drive as a jump drive - one less thing to carry. As for Best Buy, this is my first purchase of an iPhone from them (1st, Apple Store, 2nd & 3rd AT&T.) By far this was the best purchasing experience I've ever had. The salesperson was extremely knowledgable, took minutes to set up (also waited no longer than 5 minutes for her) and took great care to get me out perfectly setup (changed my plan - my idea) and quickly! 110% great!!
I was always an Android user- not any more! I was sold on how easy and smooth the iPhone 4S is to operate. So much better than Android which was always freezing up and crashing apps. I have had no problems with the iPhone 4S. The selection of apps is amazing- so much to choose from! Call clarity is excellent. The picture is crystal clear- and the camera is easy to use.
I had an iphone 3gs and was debating whether or not to spend the money for the 4S; I'm glad I did because I love the phone. It works much better than the 3 and the features on the 4 relates to my ipad2 much better than before. I'm glad I took the chance.
I've had every model of iPhone, but this one is by far the best. Several of my friends that have android phones played with mine and, yep, guess what? They too ordered the new 4S. The camera is excellent. Fast processor. Siri is great. And the phone is beautiful.
I am sure the phone will be great but the folks in Jonesboro deserve a big attaboy. I got there Sunday after the big game in Fayetteville, right after closing. It was the only time I had to get a preorder. They allowed me to come in and get my preorder. They did not have too and have won a fan. That is the way to work for the customer!!!
I can Imessage from my old phone (IPone 4) and IPad 2 at my house. With the my new phone (IPhone 4S) it only works when it feels like it. Most of the time I have to Imessage from my IPad 2. It drops calls even when I am in Logan. AT&T is suppose to cover the Preston area. Most of the time I cant even get a signal in Preston. It is suppose to load the internet faster when in 4G areas. Well it is actually slower then my old phone with that also. Over all I am not very happy with it especially when you figure how much I payed for it.
Take a charger with you everywhere you go. You'll need it!
Battery Dies very quick during the day even without use. Siri does not always understand my voice and will change my messages. I was expecting a lot more features than it is actually capable of. But it does sync to my car and I love the hands free talk and text. even though it isn't totally hands free, you still have to hold in the button or pick it up to your ear to access Siri. Has good strong signal. Overall its ok but not great.
Just upgraded from iphone3 to the 4s. Siri is awesome, moves alot faster. I'm very satisfied with this purchase.
Be sure to have backed up your old information. Very happy with it though.
Well my son returned the HTCOneX and got this Iphone 4S (Downgrade?). What matters is that he is happy with the battery life that the Iphone 4S offers but it it too restrictive, in my opinion. He jailbroked it and now it can be tweaked, he has done some crazy stuff to it now (including downloading free stuff) but still the screen is too small and he will be missing any future critical Apple updates for the device.
Upgraded from a 3GS. All the bells & whistles are as good or better than advertised. New features (Face-Time, camera flash &tc.) are hum-dingers. Everything works flawlessly. Speed is jsut what I'd expect. Main motivator for the upgrade for me was the actual wi-fi hotspot function. A little faster communications for my MacBook Pro when I'm out of wi-fi range. The tethering with the bluetooth was effective, but a bit slow. The camera with its great resolution and flash are a great enhancement, and the 4G communication is pretty much the cat's pajamas. The only thing I can see that really needs improvement is SIRI. It does not recognize my queries or commands. Seems to be regression from the original voice-dial utility. But for this one short-coming, an outstanding bit of technical convenience turned necessity.
I really like the I phone 4S, it is much faster than the 3G I had. I use the SIRA all the time it has really come in handy.
First apple product I bought. Has a lot more stuff than a Blackberry to plan your day, week, month, and years. Great camera. Tons of apps to choose from. A lot more memory than I thought. Holds what I need. Don't second guess this phone, GET IT!
Great phone except directions on hou to use it. Thank god I had a iPad which helpes a lot.
Moved to the iPhone 4S from the 3GS. Big difference. Better reception, better battery life and faster. Better camera also. Overall great phone.
Well now on my third phone. I have the 4s and had a problem with the phone randomly shutting down during the course of the day for about. 20 minutes at a time. The best buy clerk was not helpful and wanted to give me a refurbished phone even though it was in the 30 day trial period. This phone seems to be working fine now. But I would be Leary to going to best buy again. Was not treated with customer service.
Excellent telephone, excellent mp3 player, easy to use and navigate. The only thing that has been a disappointment is the voice activation feature, it works but requests need to be repeated multiple times before the phone understands. Other wise it works great.
Love the iCloud sync that moves pics, calendar notations, messages between iPhone, iPad.
Would like Best Buy to offer a class on using iPhones to help those of us who are new to this technology.
Love the phone. Was a little worried about the keyboard, but I love it. Easy to use.
I love playing with my iphone, it can do so much and siri makes it easy to set up reminders for myself so that I don't forget to do things.
Awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Great phone best I've ever had. Great service, fantastic apps.
I went to buy a wireless connection for my laptop so I could use it anywhere and ended up with the iphone 4s smart phone. This does everything I was going to do with the laptop. Siri is fun to play with and helps keep your hands free while driving. . I would like louder speakers and longer battery life otherwise I'm quite satisfied with this smart phone. I also recommend buying a car power adapter to charge while driving.
This phone has some cooler features. Love the calendar.
Ever since switching to the iPhone, I would never switch to another kind of phone again. It has all the features I need, and then some. Has great coverage (I use AT&T) and with the life-proof case, it's virtually indestructible (I go 4-wheeling alot in places like Pismo beach and Glamis and use my phone to keep in touch with stragglers)
Received random text messages/offers. Overall I am very happy with my purchase!
Overall I am thrilled with my new iPhone purchase. it has been a long time in the making and took yet another smartphone failure for me to decide to give apple products a try. I love the forward and rear facing camera. Photo and Viedo quality are good for a smartphone. Size is great for front pant pocket storage. If time proves this machine to continue performing as great as its initial impression, then we will share along partnership.
I have used an iPhone since the 3G model. Last month I bought a Samsung Galaxy II Note for the larger screen size. I took it back after 3 days. The screen size was great but the wider size hurt this old guy's hand. I had a lot of problems synchronizing my data with my PC using the Samsung/Android system . I bought the new iPhone 4S and in just 5 minutes after I brought it home I had all my apps updated and all my data snychronized. I believe that Apple has the right idea in that the hardware and software are designed to work together.
This is my first phone with a data plan and I love it. I love how easy it is to type-text or to talk-text and I use the reminder feature all day long. I hate that my battery dies from me using phone so much. But otherwise I wouldn't change a thing.
I've been using iPhones since the 3G with never a disappointment and this is one is no exception. It runs as smoothly as ever and hasn't had a RAM bottleneck yet (the main problem I've had with Android devices). Siri is fun and as useful a feature as Apple has added in a long time. The only drawback to this particular phone is the storage size. I've been collecting songs and apps for iPhones a long time and 16 gigs isn't enough to store it all. I sold my 32 gig iPhone 4 for $170.00 and that meant this phone was only $30.00 out of pocket, but now I regret not shelling out the extra $100.00 for the 32 gig model.
I've tried a few smartphones over the years, but honestly, never been able to beat my iPhone.
Great camera, battery could be a little better but it is all around a good phone. :)
I have not used my phone for multiple reasons. I was given a phone number that still listed under the previous owners name, andthe past owners name still comes up.. Also, I have to download information to my iphone which I do not know how to execute. I am wondering if I should take the phone back. It remains untouched in my living room. I am disappointed in that I could not just purchase my iphone and begin to use it immediately.
traded in my iphone 4 30gb,got a bonus 50.00 gift car bonus. walked out with a new phone and 100.00 gift card after my trade in. awsome!!!! the only thing- the new phone has a rattle when you tap it. minor but it's there. google it. its not enough for me to warrant a replacement.
Very easy to use and Siri feature is great. Email and internet features very fast.
After using few greater than 4 inch screen mobiles, iPhone doesn't seem to be relevant in the competition & its doesn't seem to give better experience these days.
iPhone is pretty good. Users can easilyy navigate, easy setup and very good camera. Short battery life, if tunned for better battery life, should compromise on other feature and appearence.
Everyone is hung up on the Apple craze right now, i think they are blind or biased to stay popular. The phone is good but not great, I also have an Evo 3d which is faster, has a much bigger and equally as nice display, and can do anything my iPhone can and more. Granted it requires a little more technical aptitude, but it's far from complex. I do experience times of lag with my iPhone and application crashes, it's far from flawless. Good, but far from perfect. I think everyone needs to get over this Apple craze, there's better products out there.
I had an android phone and hated it. Love this one.
I love this phone. My only complaint is AT&T. Which can't be blamed on the phone.
iPhone 4S continues the ongoing evolution of a great smart phone platform.
100% better than the Samsung Captivate I turned in.
I have a problem with the voice recognition of Siri.
Best phone by far love so much about it, perfect for texting, gaming, keeping up to date with all my personal business and special dates. Takes the best pictures for a cell phone.
I am constantly finding new ways to utilize the iPhone 4s. Siri is fantastic. This is the best phone I have ever owned. I like it much better than my Android based Smart Phone.
like the siri application , and the camera overall i am still new to this so am learning as i go with help from my son and grandchildren!
I learn a lot when I run into issues such as when I accidently zoom my whole screen -- the fix was easy actually once I figured it out but this is what Steve Jobs had in mind when he designed his products -- keep it simple so they can figure it out -- and I do! I love my i4s -- I've sported the i4 the past 2 years, i can't see going to another brand of phone. The quality and user friendly interfaces make my life simpler and more organized -- i'm a 51 year old female mother of 4 grown kids who love texting as much as I do...there just is not a better way to have fun with a phone and doing it mi way. The usability is like none other I've experienced -- a product I'm proud to use and own -- the Apple of my i.
Had no trouble using this phone! LOVE IT! I just upgraded from a 4 to a 4s, the only difference is that one talks and the other does not.
Great addition to the apple family. Its fast, sleek and easy to use.
If you are reading this review you obviously have never owned an iPhone, and for that I am sorry. There is no better phone on the market and if there is, its the iPhone 5 which isn't available yet! Easy to use, solid build and keep in mind its the BMW of resale value. Buy this phone (esp on contract) and you are guaranteed to make money at the end of your 2 year contract. The apps and the user experience is what makes Apple better than the rest. If you want buggyness, and bad apps then go elsewhere!
my new phone has opened up new vistas for me. a lot of cool apps. face time.
The phone is easy to use, but the best part was the man that helped me at Best Buy, he knew what he was doing and was so helpful.
I like this phone better that my old 3gs. It takes great pictures
What's not great about this phone? Ok maybe the battery is a little disappointing, but that's with most smart phones. To start, the camera is awesome. The additional fifth optical lens makes all the difference in the world. I can stand side by side with someone shooting with an iPhone 4 or an Android and the picture is so much crisper, not too mention you can shoot in much darker settings than normal because of it. The A5 processor is awesome as well. Graphics are handled perfectly, you have no issue with multitasking, and the games handle perfectly on it. I guess i'll say I wish I had opted for a 32 or 64gb 4S since shooting 1080P does take a lot of memory. But that's something you can learn to manage using an iOS device. As far as the retina display, it's not any different from the 4, but it's awesome. SIRI...what's not too like? It takes a little getting used to speaking commands, but once you've got it down, it just works. I have no problem adding calendar events, sending texts and emails (with only minimal spelling problems)...and you can still control which songs you want her to play as well. Best part...try looking for a place on the map or a phone number for a restaurant...it just works. It's awesome! Get the iPhone 4S if you don't have a 4. You won't regret moving up. The 4, I won't really justify moving up just for SIRI, but you'll not be disappointed if you do make the jump as well.
It's great! It's an iPhone 4s... You expected something different??? Warning! Siri and iMessage uses tons of data!
I bought this iphone 4S to replace my 3G. Very easy to use and super fast.
I've had the iPhone 3G8 and the 3G16 and now the 4GS 16. I am really enjoying the camera and video quality. Makes me not even need my regular camera. I also like the dictating feature for texting, and emails. Siri is NOT the best as we have a few problems with pronunciation of some of my contacts, but she has come in handy a few times.
Bought the 4S as a replacement for my wife's 3G. She loved the phone (mostly the Screen and SIRI). But the first day my son accidentally dropped it on the floor -- before we'd found a case / screen protector -- and the front glass shattered. I mean it splintered into hundreds of pieces. Spiderweb cracks across the entire face of the phone. And of course, if the glass breaks, Apple assumes it is abuse and will not cover it ... they will not even consider that the phone might have been defective. If the screen breaks, you buy it. And they want to charge you $199 to fix it. But of course if you negotiate, they will come down to $149 -- the largest reduction local store managers are authorized to make. And while I was at Apple, and later at the place I actually got it repaired, I literally saw dozens of phones brought in with the same problem. There is a huge cottage industry that has built up to repair broken iPhone screens --and other phone types of course. So, if you buy a 4S, either buy some form of insurance, or make sure you have a good case/screen protector, or both, before you take it out of the box.
Overall a great phone. I'm definately becoming an apple person. Unlike some Apple Addicts I have had and use other OS's android and I even had a windows phone back in the day. Apple is still the easiest of the group and they are the leading edge for their market. Siri is still a little buggy, but its a start and to me better than the other voice recognition out there. Plus what other VR lets you ask it random silly questions? 4 to 4s I really don't see the need for the upgrade as it's not really that much faster, but from the 3gs its the only way to go. Spend the extra money, trust me.
Love the Iphone - works as advertised. A 50 dollar discount plus a trade-in of my Blackberry Torch got me the Iphone for less than half the normal price of an upgrade. Process was smooth; the only reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 is that the sales girl sold me a screen cover I didn't need. Bought an Otter Box case that already had a cover (she said it did not). I returned the extra screen cover later with no hassle.
Impressed. Easy to use. First apple product. Will buy again
I love the 4S!! I am so glad I findly got it!!!!!!!
This is an amazing phone, camera, computer. the graphics are a must see, my pictures come out perfect every time even the bad ones.
My wife had an iPhone 3GS and returned it after 2 days. When she saw the 4S advertised on TV she really wanted to get one though. So she did and absolutely loves it. I believe the new shape/form combined with Siri is what really made the difference for her from the older one. I recommend for any iPhone user or anyone that doesn't want to customize their phone a lot. I personally like android and love my new Skyrocket., bit that is a didfferent review.
The phone has everthing I need and more. The only reason why I didn't rate it excellent was the battery life. I wish it was a little longer.
Love it! Siri is a great feature that only gets better the more you utilize her.
This is my 3rd iPhone so I'm hooked... however, Siri doesn't respond well while using bluetooth. This makes it virtually useless while driving which is the primary reason I would use voice activation - so my hands are free. Seems like this is the case with any background noise. Could be improved.
love all the features and the apps complete the package - if you are going to have a cell phone the only choice is an IPhone 4S
Just as I expected, this iPhone is hands down the best smartphone out there. The only gripes I have are a slightly yellow tint to the screen and software issues such as the mail client and syncing with other third party office products. The hardware is exceptional.
Love it. This is the best iPhone yet. I'm amazed by all the cool things it can do and I absolutely love Siri. My only concern is, I have a lot of dropped calls which I did not have before I upgraded. At first I thought it was my service provider but now I am not so sure. Sometimes I will be on a call and it will drop 3-4 times in one 20-30 minute conversation.
We replaced my old 3GS with this one for my wife. She is quite happy with it.
I am excited to finally own this smartphone. Love the look, love the easy use. I had to have a couple of "training sessions", but I am good to go now. I don't go anywhere without it!!
I am so happy I purchased the 4s! I spent a lot of time debating on whether I would upgrade to a new Android phone or if I would move over to an iPhone. I love the Android operating system and am an avid Google user. The hardest transition to this phone was the lack of Google Navigation with voice provided, turn -by-turn directions & the lack of a true Google Talk app. However the phone over-all more than made up for my 2 favorite android apps and I did find similar substitutes for the iPhone. And Siri is a trip! She also makes going hands free much easier. The phone is easy to use and isn't as glitchy as my previous phone. I think anyone would be happy with the 4s.
at first for a couple years when android came out I was hesitant about iPhone , however when this one came out I would always try to go play with it and wanted it more more and then my husband convinced me to just get it which we both did and I actually like it, I really don't care Anymore about the "personalization" android gave cuz at the end it was just too much caos, this phone actually has many shortcuts that I've been discovering each day which is awesome because i like making use of a smartphone ! After all that is what a smartphone is for despite the Mandy's cons it has many pros when put to use. If u don't know shortcuts already look them up or attend a Workshop and make use of such awesome phone Pros  keyboard typing is on point ! Video/camera are awesome Many apps for ios are excellent! iPhoto now available on iPad and iPhone which I was waiting for Quick responses Overall I do enjoy more than my Samsung nexus Cons/ needs fixing Battery life worse After recent update Wish ringtones were easier to create/install Many apps that we're available on android market are not available on apple app market like for example the one I miss most is the "mr number" which blocks annoying calls telemarketer calls etc, can't understand why apple wouldn't let that be in market  Wish iCloud had more storage for backup and syncing without having to pay for more storage  Sometimes people can't hear me
They weren't kidding when they said this is the best iPhone yet. I absolutely love everything about it from the brilliant beautiful display to the fantastically fast A5 chip inside. Siri is a dream and responds to me immediately. She'll even call a place that's not listed in your address book as long as you give her the name of the place and the basic address. This worked for me when calling a local restaurant in a hurry to catch someone before they left. Pair the iPhone with a bluetooth earpiece and you can get all kinds of information without even looking at the phone. If you're disabled, iPhone and Siri are great, depending on your disability. Push the button on your earpiece and do what you need all while still wheeling along.
Excellent phone, wish it would let you use your songs as ringtones like blackberry torch, instead of going through a lot of steps
Battery charge could be longer. Siri does not always respond properly Great photo quality Clear connection
Love it!! Can't live without it. The apps are fantastic. The quality is fantastic. I've never been an Apple person before the iPhone, but I'm going to buy an iPad just to support Apple. And now I have 4G speed on AT&T.
I had a Samsung charge 4G LTE...... The iPhone 4s is far superior in every way from the quality of the hardware to the quality of the software you will not go wrong if you choose the Apple iPhone 4s I liked my Driod ...... I love my iPhone !!
Since I bought my first iPhone, I can't buy any other phone than the newest iPhone.
I'm a non-techie person who wanted a simple smart phone. I had a Blackberry, but hated the tiny keys and screen. The iPhone 4s has a much better screen and the on-screen keyboard is a great improvement, especially since I can use a stylus, rather than my fingers. I still have a great deal to learn about the device, but I've found that it's easy to navigate through and downloads are a snap. I love the ability to synch with my iPad through iCloud, and iTunes.
I've had this phone for 1 month, so far I've had no problems with it. It's fast when loading apps. The call quality is crystal clear. It takes great pictures. I haven't tried the video so can't comment on that. All in all I'm very satisfied with this phone.
The IPhone is absolutely the fastest and most reliable product we have ever purchased.
I have never been an Apple fanboy, but this phone might turn me into one. Everything about it is intuitive and easy to use, and fast, it respond to everything immediately. The built-in apps have been great, and I quickly found the app store to be addictive. I have nearly filled the phone, just with free apps. The only real negative I've encountered so far, is that it cannot give different email addresses different notification sounds. When I get an email, I don't know if it's from work, and therefore high priority, or if it's my personal account, and can wait, without the use of a paid app (which app, MailTones, does work really well). This is my first smart phone, and it is amazing. Very happy with my purchase.
I've got a chance to use the last 3 different iPhones that have come out and have thoroughly enjoyed the new features on this one. Compared to the 4, it runs faster, looks better, and best of all, has Siri.
I only gave it 4 stars because of the battery life, the 4 had a much longer battery life. Other than that the phone is great.
Took me years before i would break down and buy a Apple product. Now i wish i wouldnt have waited so long.
My second iphone, I'm addicted. not crazy about siri, but the new camera is awesome!! takes great pictures. like the square edges versus the rounded of my 3GS. i find siri kind of useless. i can look up my own stuff on the internet. probably lots of features i don't even know about yet. just a great product and apple's customer service is superior!
I bought my first Iphone 4s and I love it. It was a fast and easy purchace with the staff knowing exactly what to do. I would buy there again. Thank you
I upgraded from a 3GS so this was a major improvement. Pros: 1. Better cell reception 2. Screen resolution is excellent 3. Very responsive - especially when the camera is being used to take shot. 4. Camera image/video quality is excellent 5. Love Siri - works most of the time Cons: 1. Apple should have made it look different from the 4 as it looks identical. Overall, ,love it. :)
I love how well the Iphone works. Rock solid on everything it does. All apps work great. There are a very things that I don't understand. For example why do I have to drill down thee menu levels to turn bluetooth on/off? The same for the wifi. Why can I create an on/off button on the home screen?
This is my fourth iPhone and they just keep getting better! I wouldn't buy anywhere but Best Buy. I love the sales people and the buy-back program.
The new phone was turned off automatically when not in use. We brought back to AT&T in Best Buy about 3 weeks after purchase. They reinstalled the program and the progam did not go. We went back to AT&T in Best Buy on the 31st days after purchase, AT&T guys acknowledged the problem but they said it's too late for an exchange (over 30-day free exchange period). I don't understand why did not exchange the phone when we first went back to Best Buy. Extremely disappointed with AT&T and Best Buy!
I love my new iphone 4s but I hate the fact that the battery life stinks. I have to constantly charge my phone, in the car, at work and at home. Please fix this
Almost everything about the iphone 4 is terrific - except, of course, for the phone itself. Phoning is awkward, requiring many actions, and not allowing for shortcuts. But the beauty of the iphone is the apps and Siri. If and when ATT comes through with an accessible 4G network maybe even the dropped calls will stop. Now if only battery life were improved....
Need to be able to put check marks to add photos to a email
love everything apple. until i found out their security is worthless. look up jail break. stealing your info takes 5 minutes. i love apple and couldn't believe how easy my info was stolen. at&t and apple would do nothing. very disappointed.
I bought this phone because I truly needed a new one. I had my blackberry for 6 years and it did not work properly anymore. I bought this phone and completely liked it BUT.... it got 2x frozen in a month, I could not switch off this phone, I tried to make a picutre of my friend and it got frozen, it got so hot so then I finally went back to Bestbuy and exchange it for a new one. Luckily I did not owe the phone for more then month otherwise I would not be able to do it. ... so far I love it very much and Bestbuy provided a good service when I exchanged my phone. ..
Awesome phone! Can't live without it! Only think I don't like is the battery life, but thats easily manageable.
Only thing I wish is that it was the iPhone 5. It is soooo much faster than the 3G and the picture quality is 10x faster
A big step up from my old 3GS in terms of speed. Battery life is good for a smartphone. Siri is not as cosmic as the ads portray it, but has certainly come in handy. Reception is better than the 3GS. I stayed with AT&T to keep my unlimited data plan, so the I still get a fair number of dropped calls -- otherwise I would give 5 stars.
I have had this phone for one month now almost exactly. I put it in a case the day I bought it, have yet to drop it, and it sits off in my car or in my desk droor while I'm at work. The phone locked up on my today. It would not even shut off no matter how long I held any button. Once that battery was completely drained and I pulgged the phone in was I able to restart the phone. My wife has an HTC Inspire droid. The only reason I got this phone was that I could play my music, Pandora and Utube, through USB on my car radio. It was way over priced. I will not be buying an iPhone next time.
all the great functions of the older 3gs i had and great new functions i wanted. YEAH :0)
The only thing that is frustrating is the sound recognition of the 4S. When I want to send a text or e-mail by voice, the phone does not pick-up my words. I have to go in and edit what the phone misunderstood. The reason I went with the 4S instead of 4G is because of this feature. A little disappointing.
I love it so far. I hate the location of the mute button when I'm in a call
The iPhone 4S is by far the greatest iPhone yet. I have tried Android phones, but I always come back to the iPhone. Every time they update the phone, they release a slew of new features. iCloud is something I have been waiting for for years. Google does an adequate job on the android front to mimic this feature, but they still can't seem to get it right. Keep up the good work Apple, you have a customer for life.
not much different than 4 - that's it. battery is actually worse and siri is far from being mastered. still by far the best smartphone out there though. WARNING: DO NOT GET TRICKED INTO BUYING MOPHIE JUICE PACK CASES-->COST $85 (YA, FOR THE CHEAP ONE!) BUT ISN'T WORTH $50-->MAKES PHONE CUMBERSOME W/NO NOTICABLE/SIGNIFICANT EXTRA BATTERY POWER---EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED THAT I TORCHED $85 HARD-EARNED BONES.
I had a 3GS 2 years ago and I really loved it but I wanted to try Android so i decided and went with a HTC Inspire 4G. Liked it, but had a lot of issues with freezing up. Then finally, it got stolen! So I decided to go back to iPhone and went with the 4S! IT IS AMAZING! The dual-core processor in this phone just blows my Inspire out of the water! Siri is just simply cool, even though Android has a voice recognition app too. But this has a personality and I've spent a couple of hours just playing with Siri and I really didn't run into any problems. The rear camera take really good pictures, but really no difference from my android ( both have an 8 megapixels). I've also come to enjoy the front facing camera and actually FaceTime an old HS friend of mine, which was awesome! Only con is battery life, but I know that's because I'm using Location Services and I use it a lot for music so that's my fault. Once I turn off LS, my battery life is a lot better. Overall, I love this phone and I don't think I will go back to Android. Now, all of my old stuff I had for my old iPhone like my alarm clock dock will finally be used again! Plus this phone, my Kenwood DDX418 and a cable will allow me to have GPS navigation in my car. If you haven't made the switch, please do so. You will not regret it!
IPhone 4s is a great product. I was already familiar with the product because research was already done. What was great about the experience was the Best Buy representative, who gave great service to assure that I understood exactly how to operate the phone. Keep up the great work and continue providing great products
First week or so it was great.... then the software update. Now the phone doesn't want to stay connected to the network. I thought it was just an AT&T issue... but seems there are 60 pages on Apples site regarding this issue from people all over the world with the 4s and Apple has yet to make any response to it. It has worked solidly now for 2 days after i taped the sim card in place... which i know sounds weird believe me but it seems to be working for the moment. Anymore issues and I'll be leaving the iphone for good... the 3g never had these problems, it was slow, but effective.
This phone is the best hands down. It's ashame to ruin it with AT&T service but I am not going to take that away from the phone. Only thing that annoys me is the SIRI. It likes to pop up randomly for no reason some times. Droid cant compete with this phone though. Apple created a monster.
Love it. Great time saver. BestBuy wireless folks did a great job as usual setting everything up. Transferred all my info off a 12 year old phone. Very happy with purchase and BestBuy service.
I love this phone, it's a phone and a mini computer all in one. The only problem I have is that for as much as the phone costs, the battery life is really short. other than that , it's perfect.
I upgraded from an iPhone 3G. The 4S is blazingly fast. Apps that crashed on the 3G run perfectly on the 4S. The camera and video capability are vastly improved. I travel quite a bit throughout Northeast Ohio and I have few problems with signal strength. I have had no battery problems that have been reported. I have always highly recommended the iPhone.
Great phone. Easy set up. You can't really expect anything less than that from Apple.
My wife bought my I phone for christmas. I was a blackberry user before this and there is no comparison between the two. I love my I phone; it's like having a computer in your pocket.
You can't delete photos/pictures downloaded off the library or folders which is very frustrating.
I already loved my iPhone 4, so when this one came out I wasn't sure it would be a big deal. However, Siri is very awesome and it is easy to use. Very helpful and fun. PICTURES are amazing!!!!
As a mobile application developer, I looked long and hard at the Android offerings. While it was tempting, I just couldn't pull the trigger yet on choosing Android over iPhone. I replaced my 3+ year old iPhone 3G with the iPhone 4s. I'm amazed at the speed of the dual core A5 chip. I kept my unlimited AT&T data plan and the 3G is indeed much quicker with the HSPA+ backhaul. My only complaint is that there isn't any 4G LTE support. However, by the time the wireless carriers have upgraded their networks, the iPhone 6 will be out.
Compared to my droid this phone is 10x better, easier to use, and double the battery life.
This iPhone 4S rocks! Very user friendly, and Siri is an awesome personal assistant. If you are a social network junkie, the iPhone 4S will keep you in the now with easy apps that bridge the gap between the you and every popular social networking site...Astounding!
I love this iphone. It's seriously one of my best purchase decisions ever. I pay a ridiculous amount for the service compared to my old cell phone plan, but it's worth it. I use it all the time. I'm amazed at the amount of apps available and all of the things it will do. It's beautifully designed and works flawlessly. I went with the 16GB. Time will tell if this was a good choice, or if I should have chosen a model with more storage, but I wanted to make sure that I would use it before putting more money into it. The SIRI feature is fun. I haven't used it much yet, and it's still a little buggy, but I understand that it's a feature still in beta testing. I have no regrets, which is a great feeling.
Phone is nice. I was only unhappy with the way my phone contacts were transferred. I have a very different looking jumbled contact list with many duplicate contacts and many did not transfer.
I would recommend this to anyone. It is user friendly and lots of fun. I was a blackberry user until I bought an ipod touch and then I knew I wanted an iphone. I just wish they were a little cheaper. Love the face time and netflix.
Love the Phone. Would not change if you paid me. Never had a phone I use so much. I like the fact that it has an Ipod and Siri is awesome.
This phone is the best phone I've ever owned. It does everything it says it does and more. Love it!!!!
The iPhone 4S is by far the best smartphone overall. Improvements in speed and overall performance over the 4 is very noticeable. The camera is just amazing, I no longer bother with my dedicated camera. Video with the stabilization is very impressive for a phone!
Really cool phone. Siri could be more helpful - most times she'll ask if you'd like her to search the web for your question... Google already has a voice feature. Other than that - sweet iPhone.
My old antiquated phone broke so I HAD to buy something new. I admit I am older and not so tech savy. However, I bit the bullet and got the newest iphone. I am surprised that I caught on so quickly to how to use it. Still playing with SIRI, not sure how useful it really will be. I Like all the features ..I can now get so much info with just a touch. This is my first smart phone and I recommend it to you even if you are a novice at smart phones. If I can use it anyone can.
Siri is great! There isn't that much of a difference between iPhone 4 and iPhone 4S, SO, I wouldn't recommend upgrading if you already have iPhone 4.
Not as great as I thought and its expensive. When I click on say... weather app... the keyboard comes up.... and etc. Have to tap 2 or 3 times for any app to come up. My son has the same problem. Farmville app doesn't do at all... its useless.
I love it... Went from the infuse to the iphone and wouldnt go back
I am very happy with this phone. It has all the features I wanted.
This is a great phone, camera and portable computer. Fast action, good screen, plenty of space for apps and it just works. (No Apple fanboy, but if something works, use it!)
4S all that I expected - one tiny annoyance - sometimes there will be a change that was not requested for example, the icons zoomed and it was not clear how it happened. Fortunately Best Buy had a quick tip to fix it!
Nothing comes close to the iPhone... purchased the iPhone 4S through Best Buy, and traded in my old one at the same time. Smooth transaction overall. Will take the same approach when its time to upgrade again in the future.
My wife likes it, buy I on the other hand am not impressed. Cons: Low Battery life with current OS Not 4G, Even though We are on AT&T and it claims it should. Only 8mp Camera Siri only works 25% of the time Pros: Finally added a forward facing camera Very quick Size is just perfect for my wife, Not very clunky like many of the phones out there 1080p Video recording
Loved my iPhone 3GS but it became noticeably slower with the OS5 update. Glad I took advantage of the AT&T upgrade offer and decided to take the plunge. The camera is wonderful and the flash makes a huge difference. It is lightning fast when searching for contacts, calendar items, etc., and the screen's display is so much sharper. Love the iCLoud functionality and convenience, especially with my new iPad2. Siri is a bonus. Fit and finish are beautiful yet the only "con" I would identify is that this phone is much heavier than my 3GS.
Bought this for my daughter for Christmas. She needed a new phone and had always had high-end Android phones so I wasn't sure that she'd like this phone but she LO VES this phone. So glad that I took the chance and got the Iphone.
This phone is absolutely smooth... I am still getting to know Siri, and she is very helpful. I went from a Windows based phone to an Android, then finally to the OS. OS is definately the smoothest and fastest, with ATT. I'm a believer. The only downfall is that this phone is only as good as the case you get to protect it. The screen is super fragile. But I got an Otter Box. Indoor pics could be better. Outdoor pics as incredible. The pic was taken with the front camera...My son was all amazed as you can see...
Wasn't sure if I should take the plunge and upgrade from my 3GS. Glad I did as the 4s is well worth it. Runs faster, smoother, and looks better. The camera itself is worth the upgrade, not to mention Siri- my new girlfriend. Makes my wife jealous. Too bad AT&T gouges you with a $18 upgrade fee.
The new iPhone 4S is a super awesome phone. I love the picture and video taking abilities that it has. Siri is really a neat thing about it too!
I love my IPhone, but I listen to alot of music and I am currently at the max for storage. I should have purchased the 32G IPhone. Again I love my IPhone but I need more space.
This phone is better than the iPhone 3G accept the glass screen is much weaker than the 3G. If you get this phone make sure to get a heavy duty screen protector or be prepares to shell out between 50 to 190 dollars for a replacement screen.
I bought this phone to replace a Blackberry that was having issues. I must say this phone has met and exceeded my expectations of it. I have owned it since the beginning of November, and even now I have no complaints, it's an all around great phone.
I love the new I phone 4S and love all the extra features, the camera, flash, Siri. it is a great phone and I am glad I upgraded.
I'm really enjoying the phone...too bad I have to have it constantly plugged in...the battery life is terrible and Apple hasn't done squat to remedy the problem. Wait until the battery issue is solved before you buy!
I have had the 4S now for about six months. As far as phone cameras go, this 8mp is great. I'm much more likely now to leave my regular camera at home. Also, it is much faster than my 3GS was, and I appreciate the new iPhone-to-iPhone free texting. I have not really used iCloud, except for backing up my phone and iPad - which works fine, so I can't comment on its other features. As you can see, I am pleased with the phone overall, and, I continue to discover new features of the hardware as well as of iOS 5.
My first smartphone the iPhone4s is a great phone. My biggest complaint is the short battery life.
It is everything the hype suggested it would be... very pleased.
Finally made the jump to Iphone and extrememly glad I did. I Use Siri every day - works better than I could have imagined texting, emailing, calendar, reminders, web inquiries, and even quick numeric calculations. Facetime is better that other video chat programs and the camera on the 4s is amazing. Due to way I use the phone, I don't get more than a day or day-and-a-half from the battery (even periodically closing programs and turning off the when not in use).
I just want to say that my overall experience at bestbuy was amazing as always!! My iPhone 4s is just as expected everything about it is easy to use!! I have AT&T and the signal on my phone is amazing everywhere I go!! The camera also takes awesome pics!! My overall experience was wonderful, I would definitely reccomend bestbuy the best place to buy an iPhone, and any type of electronics as far as that goes!'
I love everything about the iPhone. I just recently upgraded from the 3GS. It is well worth the money. For anyone with an iPhone 3GS or below, this is well worth the update; for anyone who has never owned an iPhone: GET ONE!! One of the best features is Siri. Siri puts all the other imitation apps (such as Vlingo) to shame. There's almost nothing you can't do with the iPhone. There are many great apps as well as doodads to attach to it for different uses. For example I have AppRadio which uses my iPhone; not the greatest radio in the world, but it's cool to have. Prior to upgrading my iPhone, I had the Samsung Infuse, my first Android device. I was very impressed with the freedom it gives you to do whatever you want. But I was not happy with the crashes and very short battery life. I was told that all Android devices are this way. The iPhone (even my 3GS) rarely crashed and had a great battery life. Unlike the Infuse, I could probably go a full day without charging my iPhone and not fear it running out of power. So I prefer the stability of the iPhone over the freedom of the Android.
I bought this for my husband to replace his dying Blackberry. He has always been resistant to iPhones and other Apple products, but he quickly changed his mind once I put the 4s in his hand. :) I will say that if you're looking to upgrade from the 4 to the 4s, don't waste your time or your money. The only real difference between the 4 and the 4s is Siri, and she's a bit of a joke. My husband likes to use her, just to try to prove that she works, but he often ends up frustrated and does the work himself. That said, if you don't own an iPhone at all, now is the time to buy one! An iPhone 4 or 4s is definitely a good investment.
Great experience all around at the store. I had a trade-in which I received a good price for to begin with. Then, the sales person walked me through the process of choosing my new phone and a plan to go with it. Total satisfaction...I'm a "Happy Camper"!
I took advantage of Best Buy's 30 day test period and upgraded my IPHONE 3GS to an HTC Inspire. The Inspire was a nice phone, but for 30 days I was continually trying to find ways to do what the IPHONE, and especially ITUNES, can do. Everything is harder on an Android phone, and the Apps and Android Market seem rudimentary. So, on the 30th day I returned the Inspire and spent the $200 for the IPHONE 4S. I was instantly happy, back in my comfort zone where things are easy. 16 GB is plenty for me. I'd also like to add that Best Buy doesn't charge an activation fee, restocking fee, or any other "Clear Coat Paint Option"--they aren't car dealers! Thanks Best Buy, without you I'd be lugging around an Android phone for the next two years.
This phone is my 3rd iphone. Each one was better than the last. Easy to use, powerful and all you need in a smart phone. I love it.
This is my first iphone and I love it. I had an HTC smartphone and it doesn't even compare. The iphone is so much faster to look things up on the internet and easier to use. I definately recommend it.
The phone has an annoying echo. Turning the speaker off and on helps, but the user should not have to do that. Would not buy a again.
I used my upgrade to get the new iPhone 4S and I'm glad I did! This phone is AWESOME!!! Looks like I'm now loyal to Apple products
Love it!! The only things is suri sometimes has a hard time understanding what you say and its frustrating to use.
Faster response on applications on the phone. Thanks to the dua-core A5 chip. Almost similar to iPhone 4 but Siri breaks that similarity. Beside battery draining too quickly, it's a good phone and meet my daily needs.
I use my iPad extensively and used to use a MiFi for WiFi now I use the iPhone 4S as a hotspot, phone and camera and sync it with my iPad. Very happy with this phone
I've had the new iPhone 4s for about two months and enjoy the versatility and amount of features available. It's powerful and yet still easy to use. I recommended the iPhone 4s to all who are either on the cusp of upgrading from an older iPhone or changing from another brand of cell phone.
Overall all this is a great phone for all it can do. My only problem is the battery life. Even after the software update, the battery life still isn't that great. Otherwise the ease of use, quality, and functionality of the phone is great.
took me awhile to get used to it, still learning, like the phone, would like a instruction book or video on all features on the phone. learned some things. there is a lot to learn, would like to take advantage of all there is to know.
Full of expandable features. Very handy not bulky.
Great iPhone with an excellent camera. The Siri is just OK. Siri has difficulty recognizing spoken words easily. Maybe there is a tutorial to learn the tricks to it. Battery life is good once you turn off most of the location services and notifications that are not necessary all the time. Talk-time battery life is very good. The maps app when used like a GPS drains the battery fast.
Love the iphone. I upgraded from 3G and it is such an improvement.
I'm new to the iPhone but can tell you this.....THIS PHONE IS AMAZING! I use it all the time for everything. It has replaced my laptop for travel use. Buy this phone, you won't be disappointed.
Although the new iPhone 4S is faster and has more features than the old iPhone 4, I bought it primarily for the camera. The camera takes great pictures especially in low light. It's a great substitute for a point and shoot digital camera. I love Siri too.
Easy to use, very dependable, great battery life, quality construction. Apple makes great products and the 4S is no exception. Highly recommend this product.
I love my iPhone 4S. I look forward to learning how to use Siri and have made a smooth transition from my iPhone 3GS.
It worked fine for the first month. Now the Siri has stopped working.
Much more user friendly than previous models and faster.
Not my first iPhone but it is a great upgrade! I love this phone! The camera takes better pictures and video than my digital camera does! This phone definitely exceeded my expectations. Highly recommended.
I am a long time Apple/iPhone user, and I have to say that this is the best Apple product that I have ever purchased, hands down. The Siri assist feature is a wonderful addition to the iPhone, and I use it daily. I could go on and on about how much I love this device, it is well worth the money!
Although not an exterior change for many (to me it was bc i had a black iphone 4 and now i have the white 64gb 4S, lol), the interior of this thing is phenomenal. Siri is majestic (even though I still refuse to talk to anything that is not another human being) to have fun with and while you are driving is actually pretty useful.
Siri is awesome I'm really enjoying this new phone
Love my iPhone!! Learn a cool new trick everyday. Easy to use out of the box!
so far so good. not alot different then iphone4. i lijed the design and thetefore i decided to try vut with the dual core ut is noticably faster
Does anyone else have trouble sending text messages?
Great phone and better then the 4 as the call quality has greatly improved.
iPhone 4S is another example of Apple design. Great features (siri rocks) and easy to learn, easy to use.
I was upgrading from the 3GS and glad I did. Does so much more than expected.. SIRI rocks.
Excellent phone, love Siri, love the picture quality.
It is suppose to be 4G compatible, but I have yet to see a 4G register. The browser is SLOW. The Battery wears out very quickly. WI-FI reception is poor. The Contacts app is merged with the phone and it wants to dial whenever you are searching for a number. Overall slow response to commands. This is compared to my iPhone 3S. Flagging emails is a great addition. The reverse camera is really nice, but I prefer my old 3S phone.
I love this phone and it's cloud capabilities. Siri is by far the best voice recognition software I have ever used. When she makes a mistake, it is usually because my Bluetooth earpiece is low on battery.
I was going to wait to purchase a new iPhone when the 5 came out next year. I had to wait to buy an iPhone because I was under contract with Sprint & the first iPhone I got was the 3GS. When the 4 came out I waited for my upgrade & hoped the announcement would be for the 5 in October. When it was for the 4S, I decided to wait for the 5. Then my 3GS died & i was forced to buy the 4S. I am happy I did because I love it!! The new 8MP camera & HD video with the steady focus are wonderful, the new processor flies through applications & tasks, and I love the possibilities with iCloud. But the best part of it? Siri!!!! Siri & iOS5 are amazing!! I am using Siri like crazy right now because I just had shoulder surgery & can't use my right arm which is dominant! But using Siri I can text, email, post on Facebook & keep track of my crazy post-operative schedule of appointments & physical therapy!! I love this iPhone so much that it almost makes up for all the dropped calls!! (Almost, thanks AT&T!)
It's perfect, although the sim died within 6 days, but got a replacement from another dealer asap for free.
Bought the phone for my wife. She loves it. One thing to note, take at least 2GB plan. 100MB Plan from AT&T makes the phone pretty useless. Also, AT&T connection is pretty bad, keeps dropping.
What is not to love about the iPhone 4S? My son received this phone for his 17th birthday and absolutely loves it. The iCloud and Siri add so much to the iPhone 4S. Make sure you sign up for your free @me.com email address. Thank you Apple for the amazing technological advances. Definitely recommend the Otterbox Defender case if you want to really protect this phone.
This is my first Apple Product .. So i feeling good . its a nice product
Since I got the Iphone 3g, I have always loved the Apple products. Since it was time to upgrade, I decided to get the Iphone 5 but they launch the 4S instead which wasnt a problem at all. I love the phone for all the new features and having one of the best phones in the market.
Like my new 4S the only major issue I have is when I attempt to make a call looking up a contact it shows the call going through however there is no ring or sound on my end. I can call back through recent calls and it seems to work. I have not contacted apple about this yet.
great product to use. It is very easy to use. It is a little heavy but not a big deal. the lay out is awesome aswell
Great phone. I'm still trying to learn all the different features but so far i love it. This is my second "smartphone" and I love the ease of it. Only downside is how fast the battery seems to drain. Great choice of apps in iTunes Store.
I pre-ordered this item and was impressed by the customer service that I received. It felt like VIP treatment. I also enjoyed all the special offers and optional services that were offered to me. I recommend purchasing this type of product at Best Buy to all my friends, and all my future purchases of this product will be from Best Buy a long as the service remains as good.
I loved my Galaxy S, but everyone in my family had the iPhone and convinced me to get the 4s. Siri looked appealing and I didn't have a flash, so I thought I'd give it a shot. Ugh. I wish more than anything I were swyping right now! That's the hardest change. The calendar sucks (the lack of reminder on the top until you turn the notification off is detrimental for me!), iTunes requires a password EVERYTIME you download something (really? It's my phone people. How many people do you think are downloading apps to my phone? And if they're free, why must I enter my password?!) This magical cloud isn't working for me, and that was a big selling point as well. And ringtone apps? Lame! I have found much better stuff in the Android market. And it's next to impossible to click mid-sentence or mid-word to modify your web address or text. AWFUL! This girl is getting rid of this iPhone and getting a Galaxy S 2! I can't wait to swype again!!! And have a "back" button!
I had the iPhone 3g for three years. I was waiting for the next iPhone to come out so I could get the iPhone 4 for $99. When I heard about the great camera and video camera I sprung for the 4s and I'm so glad I did. It's super fast and takes great pictures. No need for an extra camera to carry around. I really didn't think I'd use Siri, but I use it ALL the time. It's very convenient and provides for a good laugh at parties! "Siri you crack me up!" The response, "I'll take that as a compliment." I use this phone constantly. I have apps for banking, social networking, games for my kids (and me!), cooking, ordering pizza, etc. It is soooo much more than a phone. My only issue with the 4s was poor reception in a case. I was constantly losing service. I held the phone next to my husband's 3Gs - his had four bars and mine said no service. After one week, I was hours from taking the phone back when someone thought the fake metallic case would be interferring with reception. We took it out of the case and thank goodness they were right!!! My great reception returned. It has just as good of reception as my old phone, maybe even better. I LOVE THIS PHONE!!
Amazing upgrade from the 3Gs. Worth every penny! The speed of the dual processor is amazing, the apps open quickly, the camera is incredible. :)
I love my iPhone 3Gs and I upgraded to the iPhone 4Gs. I love Siri it allows me to talk to my phone for quick responses! the phone feels better in my hands with the new design. The phone is also faster in processing and with the HD video people love my movies on Facebook!
I upgraded from the original iPhone 3g and lived with many issues while waiting for iPhone 5. Was disappointed in the 4s name, but that was the only disappointment. Apps load very quickly, the camera is very crisp and meets my needs, love that i can keep streaming music while checking e-mail or accessing other apps. Screen size is smaller than many new Androids, but the phone fits in my pocket.
Everything is faster on the 4S - sound quality and ability to make and receive calls is just as good as on the 4 - camera is better but I still prefer to use an actual camera for pictures I plan to take in advance. Siri is not perfect but an interesting addition to the device. With the improvement in speed and extra features comes a slightly higher rate of battery usage but I still get all day out of one recharge. This is more evolutionary than revolutionary but overall it is a great device.
Wow totally blown away with how streamlined apple products are! The first day I had it I fell in love with (shoot does this make me an apple fanboy)! This was an upgrade from an Htc inspire, when I got the inspire i did tons of research and found several sites reviewing the inspire vs the iPhone 4 and all said the inspire was better soooo i believed them. This was my first touch screen phone and I loved it except the battery died pretty quick and the thing was pretty glitchy. Switching to the iPhone 4s is indescribable... but i'll try. Setting up the phone and iCloud was super easy, really every thing about the phone is super easy so easy it almost makes it boring ha ha. What I mean by this is it's so intuitive that there is no need to play around or customize the phone to get it how I wanted it. With my inspire there was a thousand different things I could customize and do with it and to get it to do stuff I'd have to do a bit of looking around on the internet for "how to" guides. In this regard I can see how nerdy guys love android phones and hate iPhones. Me though it's been a relief to not waste time trying to hack my phone to get it just right when apple's already done that for you! Don't get me wrong it is kind of fun to try to solve problems but I'm not really into doing that so much with phones - I kind of get my fix for this by playing around with the thousands of apps - very addicting and yes can be as much of a time waster as hacking an android phone. One thing I did have to do a little bit of research on the internet in setting up my iPhone 4s was getting gmail to work correctly through exchange, but like i said it's kind of fun solving these kind of problems but now I'm stuck with my "boring" iPhone that works perfectly. What's next...the display is awesome better than anything i've seen. love how smart the auto brightness is, something you might take for grantite unless you've had an android phone to compare it to. The touch keyboard is very good and intuitive, i hardly ever miss type things - for some reason i was always miss typing on the inspire. I do miss the big screen but i don't miss the size of the inspire. I go running and biking with my 4s and it's size is perfect I wouldn't want it any bigger or smaller. The size feels just right in your hand. It would be interesting to see how much research apple puts into something as simple as the actual size of their phones. WIth my inspire when i look at it now it seems kind of goofy and just like the developers where just thinking "how big can we actually get this thing?" like a white trash red neck figuring out how big of tires he can put on his truck. Ok next - the call quality, it works perfect, no complaints. The processor behind the phone is excellent. It's hard to judge the processor other than the phone and apps work perfectly and there are never any delays or lagging. The only thing i can really see where the better processor actually matters in comparing it to my friends iPhone 4 is in the camera. The camera does work much faster and you can tell there is some real power and speed behind how fast the phone stores the pictures you just took. The in-between time for taking pictures is as good as any point and shoot camera. With the camera - pictures are awesome! supper clear, I was worried that the picture size would be a problem with storage on the phone but....we have iCloud! I hardly ever attach my iPhone to my mac. I have it set to automatically upload all the pictures to iCloud so I can go through when ever I want and delete the pictures on my iPhone and they are on my mac in iPhoto under a folder titled "october photo stream". I'm assuming that in november it will make a new folder. Because iCloud is only free for i think 2 gb I will eventually have to physically save this folder to my computer. Might be important to note for some people that the only way to delete pictures from photo stream/icloud is when viewing them on the computer. You have access to all the pictures you previously took took from your camera in your photo stream album but you can't delete them from the iPhone. Next, the battery life is terrific and a not even something you have to think about(with my inspire i was constantly worrying about this and had to bring a charger everywhere!) I don't put my iphone back on the charger until i'm laying in bed and after I've watched an episode of the office on netflix. I guess the last thing to talk about is Siri. She's great! At first I thought it was a bit of a novelty and just a funny thing to show off to friends but it has become a very usable and important thing to me. First though I have to note that the iPhone headphones are garbage to me - they hurt my ears just sitting there for even a minute. To make Siri really usable though you need the inline controller that the iPhone headphones have so I bought the Klipsch is4 headphones (they are awesome you can see my review through best buy). I bike and run a lot and it's very useful to do things while biking or running without taking the phone out of pocket. By pressing the button on the inline controller I'm able to make a call to anyone, text, hear new text, respond to text, play fast forward skip, rewind music and even make a custom genius playlist, make notes, memos, make appointments, reminders - all while the phone is stowed safely away. It's still fun to use Siri for entertainment. My wife is always amused when I have conversations with Siri especially when I say to Siri, "Siri remind me to tell my wife that I love her in 30 minutes". In conclusion great phone/video camera/camera/assistant/music player/video player/personal video game system/gps navigator....the list could go on. The only things I can see apple improving on for the next iPhone would be for a slimmer phone (I think a phone as thin as the iPod touch would be perfect) and maybe a screen that goes goes closer to it's edges without your fingers holding the phone interfere, and of course we have to eventually get the technology to project holograms of princess leia...
For who didn't purchase an iPhone4...It is very good...And somebody calls it IPhone 4 Steve...
The phone was better than I thought, I just love the screen and camera.
I've upgraded from the 3Gs to the 4s and am amazed at the difference in the speed, the quality of the screen, and the better reception I'm getting. Before, I'd have little to no signal at work. Now I have at least 3 bars. I've not dropped one call, yet. The clarity of the screen even with a screen protector on it is awesome. Finally, the speed overall, from the apps, to the internet, to siri(the personal assistant) I'd definitely recommend this phone!
Only had the new 4s for a week and had to return it,because nobody could hear me.I had to put phone on speaker to talk..
This phone is probably my favorite piece of tech that I own. I do everything on it. It has virtually replaced my computer in almost every way and (sad to say), in a lot of ways, it is faster than my computer ever was. With ios 5, they have made the whole iPhone experience even better. Notification center does a great job of keeping everything in order and easy to access. The camera is unbelievable. My reception with AT&T shot up like crazy due to the intelligent antenna switching technology they put in the 4S and I had the iPhone 3GS before this. The changes made to this phone make it the best smartphone I've ever had and probably the best on the market. And Siri is... Well, you definitely have to try it to believe it. If you're thinking about this phone, get it. You won't be disappointed.
Looking for an upgrade from Iphone 4 to Iphone 4S ... then hold on and wait for Iphone 5 .. as this 4S is almost like 4 with new feature like 8MP camera, Siri (voice enabled web/phone search) and might be few others which i m still exporing .... I got this on upgrade from Iphone 3 ... so pretty cool for me .. with dual camera for facetalk ... the look is slik. Best Buy is taking pre-orders but they dont have white Iphones ... so be ready to wait if you want White from Best Buy Njoy your iphone!!!!
Great new phone!! I have had the 3G since it came out so this was a major upgrade for me!! I love everything about this phone!! Camera is awesome! Speed is super fast! And Siri!! LUV IT!! It even has a sense of humor!! As for the dropping of calls-- This one does so much better- My old 3G did not work in the office building where we are, but this one has at leaset two bars all the time-- Has yet to drop a call, although I have only had it a little over 24 hours, but so far so good!! I do wish it had a bigger screen though, but that is it's only downfall in my opinion--
One of the most best phones out there I LOVE IT !!!!!!!
I haven't traveled much since getting my iPhone but within my home area the reception and signal strength has been every bit as good as Verizon or T-Mobile. It's even a little better than T-Mobile within my home. I like that when I purchase an app or music, take a photo, make a note, send/receive email, etc it effortlessly gets synced to my iPad and Mac. I find myself needing to recharge every 1-2 days so I'd love to see better battery life, but that does improve when I remember to turn on WiFi when not in use. Apple needs to restore the ability to access those functions so that app developers can create the one-touch access to turn them on or off. I was unsure just how much data I would need so I opted for the 5GB plan. In casual use over three weeks I've only used 150MB so I think it might be overkill. One cautionary note: If you have a corporate savings plan like I do, know the details prior to signing up. When I got my phone the rep was unfamiliar with my savings plan. He was not able to add it to the account at the time of purchase. He said all I would need to do is call AT&T myself and it would be added to the account. This was not true, I had to register for it online and couldn't do so until 3 days later. That three day delay cost me an extra $12.00 in missed discounts.
The phone allows you to have a phone, camera, mp3 player, internet, and many forms of entertainment at your fingertips.
The iphone is the only smart phone that syncs with all four of M/S Outlook's functions: Contacts, Calendar, Tasks, and Notes
Perfect phone. Easy to use, and fun. Takes great pics and easy to text. Siri makes it fun too.
Very satisfied with this purchase & iphone lives up to my expectation.
Of course the glass is way too vulnerable and I broke mine before two weeks were up, but that's why I bought the protection plan.
I upgraded from the iPhone 3GS. The 4S has some better things than the 3GS. Overall great phone, Siri helps out a lot.
Overall a great phone. I bought it as a replacement for a 3GS where my screen was giving me issues. Siri is not as easy to use as they show on the TV. Hopefully the next ios upgrade will help with this. Also bought a LifeProof Case, as we've had some issues with our phones getting wet. Great case for the 4S. Battery life is much improved. I can now leave loacation services on all the time, whereas with my 3GS, I always had to leave it off until I needed it.
This phone tops out my 3gs the siri feature is awesome, resoulution is awesome overall good phone no complaints
i haven't had any problems so far. i like Siri, no problems.
This is my second iPhone! I wouldn't. Want to live without it now.
Simple and easy to use to use to navigate. Bought for my child to use at college.
I love my 4S. Siri gets a little confused at times. Its user friendly.
Overall, a great mobile device. I had an 8GB iPhone from sprint before and when I filled it up and needed to upgrade I decided to change to AT&T b/c sprint's service was terrible; I could never talk on their service with out the call being disconnected multiple times. Only real complaint about iPhone is the slow shutter speed on the camera...takes great pics of slow moving or still objects, but not so great keeping up with small children.
I switched over from a Droid & I was worried I'd be lost- but it was easy to figure everything out. I love it! & I love iCloud!!! Keeps my family nice & organized since my husband has an iPhone also!
Love it! I would definitely recommend it to others :)
i am really enjoying getting to know my personal assistant
The phone and apps on it are excellent. Great product. But when it comes to accessories, it is a pain as you cannot buy anything other than apple products (which are very overpriced). Big draw back!
Love my new iPhone 4s. Had the 3G for a long timeand the 4s is better in every way. Decided against waiting for the iPhone 5 mostly because I didn't want to wait 2 months for accessories.
I was resistant to switching from a competitor but the continuos lack of the apps I needed forced the issue and now I am very happy I switched. The only regret I have now is I didn't wait for the 5.
You can't hold onto it as well as the bumper types, and it's much slimmer. Took a getting used to, but really luv it!
I got this case the day I got my iphone (sometime in April) and i LOVED it! I got so many compliments and it was so slim! However it doesn't feel very sturdy. I never dropped the phone but I feel like if I did the phone would have broke. So not the best pretection. Also the glitter is a sticker so I was always picking at it. Finally one day in about June I was taking the case off and the peice above the camera broke. Very cheap. Don't recommend it if you would use it everyday.
I really like the otter box protectors. I wish they would improve the screen protector that comes with it to a better one.
I havent been swimming with it, but I know someone who did and her iphone still worked.
I love my otter box. It gives me great protection for my iphone.
Great to have a color other than black. Sturdy case. The touch screen doesnt always work when you want. You have to apply a little more pressure than the Zagg invisishield.
I paid a lot of money for this case. I've had it for a little over a month and the screen protector unglued. Also, the outer plastic cover ripped so soon. I was dissapointed when I couldn't even get an exchange because it was over 30days. Come on, you pay $50.00 for a case and you cannot exchange it for the same one because this one ripped and was no good?! How could I have not been dissapointed. If the case wasn't defective, it looks like it would be great protection for my phone, but since it was, I hate to give it a bad review but with reason.
The otterbox for the 3Gs I had previously was great! Durable and had no problems even though I was rough with my phone at work. The otterbox for the 4 has proved to be less durable even though I take much better care of my phone. The outer shell is poorly designed. The edges are thin and have come apart. The plastic inner case has broken. This new case does not live up to the toughness of the 3Gs case I owned.
The cover could be a lot better. Maybe it is not make for the I phone 4S and just needs to be cleaned up on the fit and holding capacity
I would recommend this to anyone who usually has to charge their phone in the middle of the day.
My wife continuously forgets to charge her iphone. The result was always "sorry, you can't reach me, my phone is dead." When a friend showed me his Mophie, i jumped at purchasing a unit. I can say that the best buy unit works great and gets my wife a day+ of total charge on the days she forgets to plug in. If the battery died, she just flips on the mophie which brings the iphone back to life. One big warning: Buy from Best Buy, Mophie or another authorized dealer. I first bought a unit via ebay and then a second via Amazon. I had issues with both and think I purchased fake products (I returned both with no problem). After a few months of use, my friend's also died and he suspects he purchased a fake also. If a price is too good to be true, it probably is. Pay the extra and get a legit version.
I love the Griffin Outfit Ice model (that is no longer available except at select online outlets) and assumed the Elan Ice model was comparable. It is not. The Elan case added bulk and did not seal as tightly around the phone as the Griffin Outfit Ice model. The Elan case lifted up the protective shield on my phone so I replaced it with my last protector to discover it wasn't the shield that had become faulty, it was the case. Being a "klutz", my phone fell out of my pocket (while in the Elan case) when I was sitting and landed not quite 2 feet below me on tile and cracked the back cover, making the case unusable. I had it for less than two weeks. The Outfit, on the other hand, was knocked out of my hand onto asphalt from over 5 feet and only cracked one edge. Dear Griffin, please bring the Outfit model back!
The case for the phone is great. It's really light and looks really cool. It's very sturdy and looks great.
I love this case!!! The sides of it are rubbery so it makes it easier to hold the phone and it protects the phone without being bulky like other phone cases. I also love that the back of it is cloth and has a nice different design to it.
This case is really worth about $5. Love the color and the see through back (so you can see the Apple logo) but it is rough around the seams and it has a very thin piece near the volume buttons. If something catches it, it will surely tear off.
The cover fits very well and allows for all of the connection holes to align. I can use my phone to play music in my car without having to remove the cover to get to the jack input.
I really love this case, it's a soft gel and I have dropped my new phone several times already and it did a good job protecting it. It's a little expensive though.
is just what I needed . nice color . very clingy so I don't drop it , lol
Great phone, good battery life with super fast internet browsing. Texting is also a breeze. A++
Overall a nice phone with some quirkiness. Easy to send text msgs., lots of apps, Not exactly intuitive otherwise it would be excellent, e-mail can be quirky.
Excellent value for a great product! I wish the battery life was longer, but that is my only complaint.
Phone is constantly hanging up on me so I lose the calls, won't call out sometimes, people cannot hear me, they say there is static, Poor reception no matter where I am. I call sprint, and it stops for a little while then it does it again until I call sprint, that is why I think it is a sprint problem rather than a I Phone problem. I just wish it worked.If I cannot make calls and talk without the hanging up issue and the bad reception then the phone is useless to me. Is it Sprint or an I phone problem??? Wouldn't recommend until you find out. (also battery short battery life, always having to charge) would like someone to comment if they are having the same problems. Frustrated!
I love this phone. I switched from a blackberry and was a little skeptical but I could never go back to a blackberry now! The store reps were also very nice and super helpful.
All features r great. I mostly use it for business, but I find many non business uses as well.
I like the fact that it responds quickly and has a clear screen for viewing. I also like that I can download more than multiple apps to use
I got the iPhone 4 as I didn't really care about having siri and I don't think I miss it at all. My old phone was a blackberry and this phone is light years better. Faster web browsing, awesome features and everything syncs with my MacBook. Why hadn't I gotten one of these sooner? Highly recommended.
Camera is great, getting use to everything else yet.
-Used a querty keyboard previously. The i-phone keyboard is better than i expected. -Excellent camera. -The software is intuitive. The hardware is beautiful.
So far, I'm quite satisfied and able to accomplish the needs that I purchased it for and then some!!
Having already owned an iPod touch and it being time to upgrade my phone, I looked over many reviews of eligible Verizon smart phone upgrades. I felt compelled to revisit the iPhone over and over. I am glad I followed my gut in purchasing this device. It is easy to use. Has a clear interface. Picture quality is as expected for a phone. I do wish there had been more options for ringbacks and tones. This would not be an issue on purchasing. It is easy to find apps to rectify this issue. Overall, I would suggest this phone to all.
My first Iphone and has exceeded expectations. I have everything including the kitchen sink loaded up so feels like having a full fledged computer on the go. Can now manage work, home, scouting, etc. all from the phone. Only suggestion, I hope the next iteration has a slightly larger screen. And got a great deal at Best Buy!!
Great phone for those who don't understand electronics. Got this for my wife and it is so intuitive it's unbelievable. She understands everything she is supposed to do.
i would want this phone because i can touch the screen and talk. It is the best phone that you would ever have. This is the phone that you would love because you wouldnt have to slide your phone up and down and you can type on the screen not slide or flip up then start texting this is the phone that you would have forever and thats why you should buy it.
I am so satisfied with my phone it's wonderful it was better than I thought it would be. It's so easy to use and my battery life is great.
Phone is oK but Bluetooth does not work all the time. Check Apple forum before you buy problem connecting with Bluetooth devices from time to time.
awesome phone. use it all day and it keeps on going
Great phone, easy to use, looks great. My only real beef is that unlike other phones, if you drop it it is so fragile you are done
The phone is small and fit easily in any purse. I like the slide features and the apps. It's easier to text with. I am attending a 1 hr class soon I expect i will find out many things I don't know.
A good deal for me since I don't use the phone nearly as much as I once did. 49.00 dollars and I'm happy. Wife has 4S so she can teach me the in's and out's. So much better than my 3yr old Samsung. No doubt this 4 will be obsolete in no time but it suits me just fine.
I love it! I replaced my Android for the iphone4 and I have to say that it was the right decision!
Works good, was a phone for my daughter and she loves it.
I can't believe I went so long without an I-Phone. I absolutely love it! It has everything I need, when I need it. I can access the internet, email, e-books, videos, news, weather, my calendar, i-tunes, oh the list goes on. The camera and video features are top-notch. My I-Phone is so easy to use. Anyone could learn to use this phone.
i love the phone after having an ipod touch! But I seem to be having a hard time syncing it with my itunes account and much of my music will not carry over!
This is by far the best phone I have ever owned. I find myself doing things I would normally need a computer for. Sending text, finding information and getting directions. No matter what I now have it in my hand.
Its a great phone its all in one couldnt ask for anything else
I bought this phone for my teenage son and he loves the apps to make movies. Great for a phone as well, but the iMovie maker is awesome. So is the lego movie maker.
Get this phone you won't regret it good quality easy to use huge selection of apps
Easy and fun to use. Find myself using it more than any phone I have had. I was a little worried about the glass screen since my son had one break when he dropped it(broke screen). But so far I haven't had any problems with mine.
My husband has limited time therefore I am writing his comments he has said repeatedly. He is concerned it is going to break since it is made of glass even thought he has the case. He is constantly mistyping and he gets frustrated. He likes that he can access the internet at out cabin.
I can't stand trying to maneuver around the phone and not be able to push a menu button. My fingers are tired of tapping and sliding all over. I am returning the phone and getting a droid.
This phone has a 5 star rating . It offers an excellent camera, excellent phone reception and ease of texting.
THIS IS MY FIRST IPHONE. IT WAS SO EASY TO USE. I LOVE THE PICTURE QUALITY . THE ONLY THING I DON'T LIKE IS THE SHORT BATTERY LIFE AND I WAS USED TO DOWNLOADING FREE MUSIC, YOU CAN NOT DO THIS ON THE IPHONE YOU HAVE TO BUY ALL THE MUSIC. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE.
Slim design. Fully functional. Versatile. Lot's of available accessories.
Apple quality still number one, love that it works so similarly to windows.
I picked this up on the eve of the newest model comming out so it was priced just right!
LOVE IT! I don't know how I ever got along without it. I was so reluctant to move on to the iPhone. I have no idea why I waited.
If you have had other andoid type phones this is much easier to use.
I was adamant about not jumping on the iphone bandwagon until I saw the opportunity to get this phone for $49.99. Initially I was unimpressed by it and considered returning it due to its tendency to drop calls and get very hot. However, I quickly learned a few key things about this phone. For starters, it really needs to be in a case, both for protection of the glass screen, and also to reduce the possibility for fingers to cover the antenna, possibly causing dropped calls. As a newbie to iphones, I didn't realize that leaving apps open can cause the battery to drain and also cause the phone to heat up. I had to go online and read about how to use the phone since there was not a complete manual with it. I am charging the battery about every other day, but I am not using the phone constantly. I imagine that people who have no land line and use the wifi all the time would be charging it daily, easily. That said, the wonderful thing about this phone is of course, the usefulness of the apps. I use it for navigation, music downloads, email, facebook, NFL updates, and more. The possibilities are practically endless. For me, that makes the phone worth having. Based on my minimal use of the camera, it seems to be good. Speakers are fine, though I don't have high expectations for phone speakers. My recommendations are as follows: Buy accessories for the phone online--much more affordable; do research on other smartphones out there (something I did not do) to compare and see if this is the right phone for you; go online and read the phone manual.
Better half says this phone is the best ever. Previously had Droid HTC Incredible.
Son and daughters have iPhones and facetime everyday; so me and the wife had to get iPhones. We really enjoy the phone.
Needed an upgrade and for the money this was an excellent choice.
I got this phone as an upgrade for $50.00. Great value for the money. just wish I could pair with my imac using Bluetooth. I know it's "old technology" but works the best for my needs.
It's very sturdy for sure, but the white portion of the product gets dirty very fast
I've dropped my phone with this on and it didn't allow any damage to the phone. Worth the cost!
It has been a great protective device and the colors are great. But the white rubber stains easily and can't be cleaned or I haven't found anything that cleans it yet.
This is a good case that is not too bulky. The only complaint is the white rubber part of the case has gotten dirty and I've only had it a couple of weeks.
Had been avoiding the investment but it was on sale and I had reward $ so ... Very happy with it. Easy on and off, screen protector easier than some to put on. I got the white/purple. White cleans easy (with phone out) in dish detergent. I then let it dry overnight. Works better than anything I have tried and this is my third iPhone since they came out. Will get it again when I give in to the iPhone 5 this Spring. Down side is I have to undress it to put in some docking set ups that play my music.
This case fits over my invisible shield by Zagg and does not wrinkle it up. It feels like it will protect my phone well. It does slide on smooth surfaces and the white part is dingy after minimal use but I still feel good about the case and it's protection of my device.
Protecting your iPhone purchase with an Otterbox is the right choice. The phone works flawlessly while giving you the confidence that your device is protected. Both my 16 yr old and I have the Otterbox and are extremely pleased with them.
The OtterBox is a product of exceptional quality and provides good protection for the iPhone. However the OtterBox make the phone more bulky and not easy to carry. For that reason, the product does not work for my needs.
I had this case for less than one month. While taking my phone out of the case to put in my armband to run, the rubber molding broke. Two weeks ago the rubber came loose around the home button. I wouldn't spend the money on this case.
This is a great case for someone who doesn't want to worry about scratching, damaging, or dropping their phone. I use this phone case, and so do the guys I work with. If you're looking for a smaller case that is lightweight, you should definitely try something else. If you want something rugged that is meant for the working man, then you should definitely get this case.
It is a little pricey, but a replacement phone is even pricier.
I have this otterbox on my iphone and yet one drop still landed me with a crack iphone window. Not sure what the "real" function of this otterbox is. Pricing is high
I would highly recommend this iPhone case to anyone that is hard on their iPhones. It is a solid case and yet not too bulky like other cases I have seen. I mostly carry it in my pocket and do not use the belt clip. The rubber case will not allow the iPhone to slip out of your hands.
I anguished over many phone protectors before choosing this one, but the only time I dropped this phone was precisely because I thought it was firmly in the holster when it wasn't. The holster often sounds like the phone clicks in when it doesn't. I don't use holster part any more.
I've used this type case for over two years. The first one was red, and the silicone faded to pink after about a year, but phone was immaculate since the case was taking the abuse. The silicone finally tore as I was removing the case to do a cleaning. I bought another duplicate case which is in service now for 6 months. Phone is still in perfect shape. Working construction around all the dust etc requires cleaning the case more frequently but, I've dropped my phone from a 6' ladder and when I picked it up, all was well. If you're worried about the bulkiness, don't be. It's what you get used to. It seems people want a paper thin case to offer the same protection. Really ??? Not going to happen. The holster is extra durable and has also served well. Even though it's all plastic, the clip, spring, and detents, still work great. Hope this helps.
I love my new iPhone but what I don't like about it is that it's all meat and no fat, meaning that if I drop it, it's time for a new phone, period. Enter my OtterBox case. The case is great in that I've dropped my phone once or twice already and nothing's happened. The only problem I have with it is that the phone itself has a weaker battery life and I'm looking to get a case that has a battery built into it. Will probably do that eventually but for now this is just fine. Beyond that, yes, it adds some weight to the phone itself but I have no problem with that because I got the case with the phone and thus haven't known any different.
Best protection for your iPhone, my sons had them on their old phones and they were damage-free. Not inexpensive, but cheaper than a protection plan and just as effective.
I like this Otterbox. Used to use a slimline case until I dropped the phone and it wasn't protected at all. This is a great product but can be a little bit of a pain to take out and put back in the case to use on a dock.
Best used by children... rubber coating provides extra protection. However, it takes forever to get out of pocket because of rubber coating.
Best choice for a case to protect your iPhone. If you don't like bulkiness, I would try the commuter series. Overall, this is an excellent case I would recommend to anyone looking for the best protection.
Otterbox is one of the best manufacturers for protecting your electronics, in my opinion. I have used them for years and dropped, banged, thrown my electronics and Otterbox has protected my products without hesitation. I won't buy anything else if I have a choice.
Case is good protection for my phone. Easy to hold on to. The non slip grip feels good, gives secure feeling that I won't drop phone.
The top of the case tore open. I am a user that is hard on cell phones. It borke very soon after my purchase. The Apple store had warned me agaisnt this product, they were right!
i have a bunch in all different colors. protects my phone. child proof lol
When I got my first iPhone and it quit working within days of the purchase I decided to go with the maximum protection I could find and that was the OtterBox. It served me well for several years, but seemed to be a real dust and dirt magnet. When I got the iPhone 4s I decided to again get an OtterBox. While the original was good, I think the new one is better. Not quite as bulky but still provides very good protection. My only complaint was that it was a bit of challenge to figure out how to get it on the phone. (Why can't anyone write out instructions anymore, instead of just relying on pictures?)
Excellent protection for the phone. However, it can come off your belt, as has happened to me, allowing the phone to fall to a concrete floor. So far, the phone still works fine. It is a good looking cover, but the latch protrudes especially when the phone is removed, and rubs my elbow. Overall, excellent protection for the phone, which is my main concern.
I bought this to clip on my belt when walking. I have dropped it three times on the ground and no problems. I had it in my pocket when I got drenched at Splash Mountain at Disneyland and it kept it completely dry. It is worth every single penny I have paid and I recommend it to anyone who wants to protect their iPhone.
Amazing phone. Haven't found a single flaw yet. Totally integrated into my everyday life and so easy to use.
I wonder if this will ever make it. I'm writing a review on the iPhone as I do not feel this is the greatest product in the world. I have taken screenshots of my review to see if Bestbuy will take it down. Nonetheless... Here's why its great, and why its not. The phone has Siri. Kinda cool to play with, but then you realize that Apple is able to modify the database. This used to be driven based off of wolfram alpha's engine and now has a blend of information. Additionally, the phone drops calls when you hold it the wrong way. Kinda sucks. It gets very hot during face time calls and it feels as if it is too slippery. The phone has also become far too mainstream. It's like being a cattle in a pack. Oh what phone do you have? I have the 64GB Model... OOOO I only have the 32. Give me a break. The phones with apple are all the same. This is debatable if it is a good thing or not. The phone feels like it is well built and has a nice feel to it. It does a great job with texting, the input is very accurate. The apps are cool and all too. The phone is great because it feels expensive.
I use this phone for everything. Business and pleasure.
I love it! Have had it for about 2 months now, haven't had any problems with it. Best phone I've ever had!!!
I was hesitant to purchase the iphone, now I would have a hard time being without it. This phone is more than I thought it could be.
The is the BEST phone I have EVER had! I have been with every carrier and have had 2 Androids, 3 Blackberrys, 1 Nokia SmartPhone, and I must say that I will NEVER think about switching again. The iPhone is really created with the end-user in mind. The applications, the hardware, the accessories all make up an amazing experience, and reliable service. My battery life has been great, and the speed of the device is one of its best (of many) luxuries. I wasn't a believer at first, because everyone went GaGa of Apple's iPhone, but now I see why! I use it for everything, now!!! At the risk of sounding like a commercial, "It makes my life easier!!!" -REALLY!!!
Yep..and for good reason! I have been an iPhone user since the first incarnation. This phone is as successful as it is because it stays true to a near perfect formula. The Android OS has seen definite success and is great in its own right, but in regards to its relationship it has consistently been either A) Android OS releasing technology in an attempt to emulate and chase iOS's functionality or popularity OR B) Android OS comes out with an idea and iOS releases a similar product that is infinitely better and more stable. One such example is the 4s's Siri. While voice commands have been around for quite a while, anyone who says "Yeah, my phone has been doing that for a long time," doesn't truly understand Siri's capability. I needed detail any further, the commercials speak for themselves. No voice command app is able to do what Siri does. That's just one example why the iOS is superior in both class, stability and functionality. The 4s is an awesome step forward. I will say this, however, if you have a 4, don't waste your time with the 4s. Siri is awesome, but not worth the money or the use of your upgrade. Wait for the 5 which rumor has it is going to be more than an upgrade.
I've had a Droid for the past 2 years and it was time for my upgrade. I Waited for the new iPhone and was very glad that I did. It's an amazing phone where I can Store all my music, movies, games, and pictures on one handy device. The Hard drive size might be a little big for some but I wanted everything on one device. Otherwise I would have just went with the 16gb or the 32gb model. The call quality is great and the picture quality is flawless. Siri is also a very helpful Voice assistant that can quickly find information to any question. The best part is you don't have to speak in a specific tone or wording to get her to understand. The only downside right now is that the battery life is a little weak. This isn't because of the hardware but because of a problem with the software, so it will be fixed in the coming weeks. Overall an amazing phone and Apple kind of hooked me in with this one, so I probably wont buy anything over then an iPhone now.
Great phone with many useful amenities. Siri is a blast and quite useful as well. We've become an Apple family and soon will have all four of us using an iPhone.
LOVE IT!!! Can't seem to put it down. I have not really had any issues with the battery life.
After using two competing smart phones that had issues after about one year, I switched to the iPhone4s. The startup of this phone was simple and I was able to start using with a minimum of fuss and muss. Apps available seem to cover most of my needs for the first two week that I had the phone, including uploading my contacts I do wish that the documentation was better, I had some difficulty trying to use specific things that I had to search to find.
I've been an Android user for a few years until recently and other than learning the new OS and its ticks, the transition to iPhone has been painless! Screen display is bright and colorful, cameras take quality pics and vid. As long as I have decent signal strength my calls are very clear, both the speaker and mic. Great selection of free/paid apps available. Great selection of accessories from apple and 3rd party. Operating system is a breeze to navigate through once you familiarize yourself with it. At first I was hesitant to switch to iPhone but am very happy with the switch now. Love the fact that I'm not carrying a mini tablet around in my pocket!
Good protection at a very reasonable cost. Great corner protection. Reccomended if you drop your phone frequently.
Nice case but I had a hard time getting the screen protector into the case.
Like the case but had a terrible time getting the clear plastic screen protector on and then the case didn't want to go over it. So the edges of the clear protector don't look good.
Got this case shortly after I got my 4S (Oct 2011) and was very pleased with it initially. I looks nice, if not a bit bulky, and it is very good at protecting the iPhone if dropped or with everyday use. What is very disappointing with this case is the materials they use for the silicone protection age very poorly. After a few months it starts to stretch out and crack/tear and since the silicone has to fit into seams of the hard plastic shell, this becomes a problem for both appearance and protection, as things then slip past the openings that are formed by these issues. Also, the cradle/holster is VERY bulky (I know! I know! The iPhone itself is bulky in this case). I caught mine in the seatbelt of my car as I was getting into the passenger seat and snapped the belt-clip right off. Broken! Ruined!
bought this otterbox for my 13 year olds first iphone. its great protection.
When you buy an Otter box you will not be disappointed. I have purchased many in my home for EVERY phone. If you ever have to call customer service it is a real person. I broke a clip one time. Hassle free to replace. Worth every penny!!!
THE OTTER BOX ITSELF IS GREAT. THE BELT HOLDER BROKE IN LESS THAN A WEEK. I STILL HAVE TO RETURN IT BUT THE COVER ITSELF IS DEFINITELY A MUST BUY.
The product is similar to any Apple branded iPhone accessory without the Apple Tax...and it comes in Black. :-) Works just as good as the Apple charger would. However, the White Apple charger one has a slight advantage in that the cord's length is about 2 feet longer. This may not be that much of an advantage to most, but for me, and the USB ports on the bottom of my computer case, and the case sitting on the floor....my phone barely reaches my desk when it's plugged in. Other than that, it's Tip Top.
Sturdier than my original charger, also has good quality USB connection
the detachable usb cord makes it easy to charge different units
Works great at home for the ladies in the house who don't need a hard cover for the iPhone. I have a chip out of mine from having dropped it so frequently. The charger will not fit through the cover into the phone. Bought with phone and now use only as an emergency spare. Buying a USB car charger (Rockfish) as more practical for commuting. See the two below which I have used and like.
I got exactly what I expected and durable and reliable replacement for my iPhone charger. I didn't give it all 5's simply b/c if I could change anything, I would make the cord longer - otherwise it's perfect.
This product is definitely not worth the money. It rarely works--I have an old charger with a broken wire that works better than this one. I am surprised that Best Buy carries such an inferior product.
Very hard to be useful because the. Odd is too short
I've recently purchased this case and have gotten compliments on the appearance, but the case isn't worth the money. The material on the side of this case easily comes off. I've glued it several times with super glue but to no avail.
This is a great purchase for someone who is looking for the extra battery life during the day. This case does not add too much bulk to the device when on. I was torn between this case and the juice pack plus model, my only complaint is the the volume and power buttons are sunk into the case. This isn't too big of a deal but kind of gets annoying not having the button rise out of the case such as the juicepack plus. Otherwise this case is awsome and I highly reccommend this to anyone.
I recently bought this case for my iPhone 4, thinking it would be spectacular. Don't get me wrong, It was great for about 3 days. One day while i was playing video games, i picked up my phone (in the case) to charge it, only to find it was broken. I had not dropped the case once. I returned it to the store and got a new one. Guess what? It didn't work. It would not charge the case with multiple charger cables or adapters. I will be returning it again today, to get a new case for my iPhone. Overall, I am disappointed with the case.
This doubles the life of my battery. It adds quite a bit of weight to my phone, but the long life of my battery makes it worth it... I only need to charge my phone once a day now, compared to twice before!
I purchased this case while on vacation b/c I was constantly running down my iPhone 4S battery trying to upload pictures of our trip. I would last about a half day and then would have to leave it in the car to charge. First thing I noticed, the case doesn't fit as snug as it should. There was a gap at the top, b/c the top part of the case wouldn't snap down into place like it should have. The top part came off a few times while pulling the phone out of my pocket. the case isn't too bulky considering it is a charging device as well. I think they should have also provided a screen protector inside the box, but they don't. The charging feature is great. I had the battery below 20% and then flipped the switch to "ON" and then watched the battery power go all the way up to 96%. I made it the whole day without putting my phone in the car for awhile to charge. Great charging feature, needs work on a better case.
This saves me when i'm traveling. My phone always has a charge and i don't have to carry a charger in my pocket.
I have been 100% satisfied with this product. I have only had it for less than a week but it has HUGE advantages over the competitor. 1) Weight = Light so it won't make your iphone weigh as much as a bowling ball. 2) Feel = Amazing. I actually love having the case of for the design and how it feels to hold it in my hand. 3) You can charge and sync your phone while it is in the case there are other cases out there that you cant sadly. 4) The case comes up slightly higher than the screen so a drop won't risk your screen right off the bat.
Not only does this offer the security of extended battery life (which is quite nice) the black rubberized case looks and feels great. I do note-- we had to come in and exchange the red limited edition one, however because its finish was not as nice and wore poorly in the 2 weeks I owned it.
Its a great product. A little pricey but i think its overall worth it. Pretty much 2 batteries. 2 In one charging makes it a lot easier. I would recommend it for people that use there Iphone a lot, and or don't have access to a charger when needed.
This is my second Mophie battery. Oh no the first one is still fine and holding tight but I got a new Iphone 4S for my wife and decided to pick her up one as well. Just like my other review this item keeps going and going like the Energizer Bunny. Mophie has excellent customer service and this is the essential tool for the road warrior or power user. Pros: (for me) is the fact it eliminates the iPhone charge/sync cable and lets you use a micro usb. This is huge for me and means less cables I have to worry about. The extended battery and top notch customer support is just icing on the cake. Cons: The case is a little expensive and for such a protective case it should come with a screen cover. I think this could give the phone 360 degrees of protective coverage.
I loved this when I first got it because i didn't really have to charge my phone for almost two days depending on my usage. Yesterday, it broke and couldn't charge because the piece on the extended battery where you plug the wire into broke and couldn't be fixed and would charge the device. Glad I got it on sale for $40 2 months again , I would be really mad if i paid the regular price of $80
While in El Centro, CA my phone was constantly trying to find a signal and I couldn't make it through the day before I had to recharge my phone so I broke down and bought this charger. I must say I did not have to worry about my phone dying the rest of my time there or anywhere else for that matter. A little pricey but you will not be disappointed!
It does add some bulk/weight to the iPhone 4s, yet the benefit of significantly extended battery life outweighs this.
I love this thing. I always run my battery down on my iphone and carry around a charger with me everywhere. Now - I have the peace of mind knowing that I have a back up and don't have to worry.
Before I got the Mophie Juice pack for my I Phone I would run out of battery life frequently but not anymore! I love the Mophie!!!
This is a very cool and nice charger, my phone was at 30% battery I turned on the charger and it charged it fully! but I didn't see much use for it because I was never away from an outlet for more than a few hours so I returned it. But if you are one that is a strong user of your iPhone then this is a very good product to invest in.
Awesome gadget. I no longer worry about carrying my AC charger everywhere, just in case my iPhone battery runs low. Power on demand! Love it!
I got it to save my battery life and the phone connector beside being a case, very satisfied wih it
So my iPhone at home has terrible coverage. The phone is constantly searching for a signal which completely destroys my battery by midday. This case enables me to go the entire day without having to worry about charging. So nice! The only down side is it makes the phone a little heavy. I like the slim sleek look myself. This still has a little of that but is just heavier. I can also turn the case on and off for charging my phone. After using the case for a while you can pretty accurately predict how much charge u have left on your phone. I can just say the fact that I am able to actually use my phone all day and it is not sitting in my car charging makes any downside of this case irrelevant.
I liked it so well, I bought one for a friend. It is very light weight and is pleasing to hold.
I was looking for a battery case for my iPhone 4S and happened across this one while browsing the web. I read some reviews and decided to purchase one in my local BestBuy. The Good: The look of the case goes well with the iPhone 4S. Although it adds some bulk to the phone, it's still on par with most others I've used. It's extremely easy to insert the phone as well and it feels really secure with an exception of the front display (I'll go into in the Bad). The micro USB output works with any micro USB cable that I've had as well which makes it extremely convenient to find a cable to use when I do have to charge it. The battery meter located on the bottom makes it really easy to check the level of the Juice Pack at any time. The speaker holes really do an excellent job of redirecting the sound upward instead of straight out of the bottom of the iPhone. As far as extending the battery life of the phone... this is where the Juice Pack truly excels. I will charge up the juice pack overnight (starting around 1am actually)... I disconnect it around 8:30am and when I get home at night I'm usually still at 100% iPhone battery and 2 lights left (50%) on the Juice Pack battery meter. This is with receiving email all day... making a few phone calls.. surfing the web at lunch... texting... watching a couple of YouTube videos... my standard day. The best way I've found to use it to make the most out of the extended battery is to flip the charge switch on when the phone battery drops to about 95% and when the phone battery reaches 100%, then flip it back off. If you're looking for a great extended battery in a case, this is the best I've found. The Bad: The only issue I have with the Juice Pack as a protective case is that it doesn't feel like the front of the phone is as protected as it should be, which for me is not a big concern... but it could be a sticking point to others. The other issue I had with the Juice Pack is I had to return the first one I purchased the next day because it slipped off my coffee table while charging and it pulled the internal charging cable connector loose (It was rattling inside). I don't think the connector is as well constructed as the rest of the case, so you would need to be careful with it. Overall I would recommend. Good luck!
The Mophie Juicepak helps to provide excellent protection fro your phone when you accidentally drop it. It also provides great battery reserve for those who like to play games or run other apps on their phones, are away from their chargers or plain simply forget to charge their phone.
I bought this brand and model because it was the only one left on the store how ever now I see others are cheaper and have more mAh of battery capacity. I use it when I drive my motorcycle since the gps and Bluetooth for my helmet drains the iphone battery very quickly. This product is the best and only option for this particular use.
I purchased this product from Best Buy. It is an excellent product for busy commuters who are constantly recharging their iPhone 4. The Mophie Juice Pack AIr doubles your iPhone's battery life while on the road, and provides great protection for the OEM glass & aluminum body. I was hesitant to spend $80 on this product, but looking back, it was an excellent decision!
Not only is it a great Battery Pack it also doubles as a wonderful sturdy protectivive cover for the phone. It does add a slight bit of weight and length to the phone but for me it makes it easier to hold and use. The company is in the process of making a belt clip for it and should be available mid January. In the mean time I bought a point and shoot camera holder that attaches through your belt and that works just fine. Great product.
This is best decision I took after purchasing my IPhone 4S. It doubled teh battery life. I now charge my iPhone only twice or 3 times a week and that too with all features enabled. The Charger is absolutely amazing.
wow! I am glad that stopped by to read about this product. I went into bestbuy and purchased one after reading the reviews. this is the best accessory I could have purchased for my phone. the price is right when you consider it's dual function. I love that it's not bulky. I love that now I don't have to worry about losing battery power. I am going to google it to see if they have one for the iPad as well. lol since I got this, I have dropped the phone 2x and the hone is fine. if you get this I don't think you will disappointed. I have already mention this and shown it to a few friends.
I freaking love this thing. The battery on my iPhone has gradually degraded little by little to the point where I had to leave it on the charger at work to even make it thru the workday. I let it drop down to 15 or 20% then flip the switch and it rapidly charges me up quicker then when I just have it plugged into my regular charger. The case doesn't add much weight and actually make the phone easier to type emails on since it adds a little girth for my big hands. For anyone that travels a lot of just had poor battery life with their 4 or 4s it is the perfect solution.
I'm just going to say it like it is. It a battery case! Yes, it's going to add size and weight. I like the extra size and weight though because I have big hands plus the non-slip coating is great too compared to the slick glass on the IPhone 4 itself. I had one of these for my 3GS and loved it as I'm a really heavy user and this model didn't disappoint. It will give you about 60-70% extra battery and the case protects the IPhone really well. I dropped my iPhone many times on gravel and concrete, of course as you would imagine, the case takes a beating but my IPhone is fine.
The company purchased this product for a client. We received the item and at first it looked good. We tested the issues below on two different iPhone 4s both showed the same issue. When the iPhone 4 is in the sleeve everything was good till you put the sleeve in your pocket. The motion from walking around had the phone connect and disconnect from the sleeve which made the phones charging sound come on and on and on .... Even when you tried holding the phone in you your hand and moving the phone would make the charging start and stop. Also, we found that the unit could only charge the iPhone from a 20% iPhone battery charge to a 75% charge before the juice pack air was flat. The juice pack air is the smaller version but we would have thought that you would at least get a full charge. From the other reviews here it looks like the product should work and we might have received the Monday-built version and combining with the experience and the battery performance we give this product an Average rating.
I've gone through at least $150 worth of iPhone 4 cases and was disappointed in ALL of them, until now! Mophie promised a lot with this new Juice Pack Air, and they've certainly delivered! I was worried this battery case was going to add considerable bulk to sleek size of the iPhone 4, but I was pleasantly surprised at its compactness. Ease of use would allow a child to function and the LED's that depict charge percentage are very cool. The matte finish on the case makes sliding in and out of pockets a breeze! Only bad thing I may say about the case, if anything at all, is that I can't dock it with my iHome or other docks without removing it from the case. Not really a problem since it's the fastest and easiest to remove i've seen! AWESOME PRODUCT!!!
I do a lot of traveling - and it's great not to have to worry about your battery dying. It works extremely well with the iPhone 4.
I have not made a more satisfying purchase since I bought my phone. I am always on the go and this case has made my phone last all through my day which ends well into the night! My phone hasn't died on me since I bought it. It's also very stylish and actually enhances the look of the phone. I have a white one. I've also dropped it a few times with no damage to either my phone or the case. I bought my husband the juice pack plus which is a bigger battery. Now I'll always be able to reach him. Changed my life! Love it!
Not quite sure if the other reviewer got a bad unit, but this charger case is amazing. It's sleek and doesn't add much weight at all. Most of all it has already saved me twice this month. I left the house with out my charger and it was so nice to flip the switch and watch it quick charge. I highly recommend this piece for anyone that is a high user of their iPhone.
Fail in every way. Doubles the size and weight of the phone. Seems to cause phone battery to drain faster. And case battery is not good either. Iphone battery had 20%. Powered on the case and it charged it to 70% before it died. Waste of money and way to bulky.
Great idea to have a battery replacement inside a case with indicator leds showing the level of battery. I loved this stuff while it worked. The plastic case is extremely robust. Don't know if is good or bad, but felt like I had a big mobile phone of the 80's. The worst part of the story started when one day the USB connector started to came loose until broke! Of course I cannot use it any longer. and it's just a USB bracket that could cost a couple of dollars... All the good impression I had about this stuff was vanished in one second. Don't know if a warranty applies for this. Hope it does!
This product suffers from the same poor design as my old blackberry curve. While it is quite sturdy and does its job well, the weak link (chink in the armor) is the USB connection port. I bought 2 of these, one for me and one for my boss. Within 3 weeks mine was broken and his kicked the bucket a few days later. Same problem both times, the charging port came loose and ultimately would not work. Neither was dropped or mishandled. $90 for the charging cased and felled by a $1.95 charging port. I give it 1 star because 0 stars was not available.
Good looking and seems to be a grood protection, but the extended battery life is great and is the major reason for the purchase. I use my iphone for business and am on it all the time. Now I can use it the full day wihout having to charge it.
I LOVED my Mophie. It did make the phone quite a bit heavier but I was able to use my iPhone throughout the day and not worry at all about decreased battery life as I do without the Mophie. However the charging plug snapped inside and I could not connect to recharge the case again. I have returned all to mophie direct per the warranty (1 year) and will see if they honor the obvious frailty and equipment failure of the connector inside the case. It obviously is due to poor design as you can hear the connector rolling around inside if you shake the case.
I love this thing. I regularly use a iPhone music player that requires my phone to be out of the case. This case comes off really easy and its easy to replace as well. I get full charge on the phone from the Mophie which gives me about 6-7 hours more of battery life and it charges in about 2.5 hours. It comes with it's own USB charging cord that is different from the iPhone's 30 pin connector. The only downfall is there isn't a screen protector.
I bought a "juice pack" and to my surprise, after charging it more than 24 hrs with the phone in it, my phone was totally discharged. (It was full when started this). Repeated trials lead to same results. I bought a second one, thinking I got a lemon, but I saved the receipt this time. Same result, instead of a juice pack it was pack of sucking the juice from my phone. I tried charging it separately, it doesn't work any better. At last, I returned the gadget and I will never buy another one from mophie.
Very useful since my phone dies a lot because I am on my phone constantly playing games. The price is a little steep, but if you are an avid iPhone user, this product is great!
My wife got me this case for my bday, b/c I need to have a charged phone in case I have to make stocks trades while not at home. I wasn't a huge fan b/c the case is bulky, but having that extra charge was handy for the few months that it actually worked. The most critical piece to the case is the USB port and it broke loose and no longer accepts a charge. Could have a been a strong product that I would have used for years.
The iphone has an 8G camera which takes great pictures. This accessory is just something else to get lost and isn't worth the money. Buy another camera with a zoom on it before buying this. I took it back the 3rd day I had it.
this is a great product to get if you like to take pictures it helps take better pictures and extends you iphones abillitys.
This lens fits right over my IPhone 4 perfectly... I love the Fisheye mode for school event picture taking, and the macro lens for taking pictures of small things that I want to put on any of the merchant auction or ad sites. This is my new favorite Toy.
I'm so glad I came across this product. The Olloclip is the best fisheye and wide angle lens for the iPhone. It attaches easily and stays securely locked until you want it off. You can instantly notice the difference with the 180 degree fisheye, you can take a picture of the wall and see part of the ceiling in the shot. It looks amazing. The wide-angle is good too, definitely makes the iPhone more like a point-and-shoot. I haven't really found much use for the macro, other then taking microscope shots of my finger and small objects. You can pretty much put the lens right up on your subject and get a crystal clear image. The Olloclip may seem expensive compared other magnet-style iPhone lenses, but this one really is superior. You want a lens that is going to stay put and easily removable, not dealing with sticky adhesive rings on your smartphone and crossing your fingers that you don't shake the phone enough to knock the lens off. I'd recommend this Olloclip 3-in-1 lens to anyone with an iPhone thats interested in photography and video. Its great for sports, where you can get close to the action yet still capture everything in the shot. I personally use mine to film skateboarding, and for that it works awesome. The lens bag also doubles as a microfiber cloth, which is pretty clever. You can't use it with a case, but thats easily remedied. Just take off the case when you wanna shot some great photos/videos, then put it back on.
-Three lenses. The fisheye is the most useful. -Easy to use. It just slips on over the i-phone camera. However, cannot be used with an i-phone case. The case needs to removed.
It is an awesome lens. The it is exactly what you think your buying. The quality is excellent. I didn't give it 5 stars because it covers up the flash. I don't really need the flash too often but I think they could of made it without covering the flash. The pictures that I have taken with it are in no way diminished by the lens. Buy it!
I took this to New York and was great for taking awesome shots of New York Skyscrapers. Get real (meaning not faked with an app) Fisheye and Wide-Angle shots. You'll be looking for new things to take pictures of, trust me.
Recommend! We can see everything: heart, speed, cadence, calories, gps, etc... But It's a little big case for the bike...
I can't really give this a valid review, because the package I got (which appeared to have been opened before, although I was assured it was not) was missing a couple of parts. From what little I could see, though, the mounting seems fussy. No opinion on how well it works because I didn't get that far.
I can't begin to tell you how great a product this is. I have both the bike kit accessory and simply the little adaptor by itself that I simply attach when I go running or hiking. It's also compatible with Gamin accessories as well. (bike Cadence and Speed/ Heart rate monitors) Ant+ power meters and such as well. It brings a whole new level to fitness and training allowing me to use to track all kinds of information and sharing or challenging other people with online. I use the MapMyFitness App with it and it tracks and updates me with a weekly recap on my progress. Come check it out... Once you get it and start using it, your never train or keep track with anything else. New feature through the MapMyFitness is real-time tracking on it, if your racing and friends have come to support you, they know where you are at on the course at all times. Or if your just out training your Wife/Husband knows where your at as well.
This is a very decent pouch for the iPhone 4 / 4S. It looks like designed for girls/women with a credit card pocket built in. One credit card will fit tight in the pocket. Putting more than one credit card may result tear and wear to the pouch. It is highly recommended to use hands-free/Bluetooth headset while using this pouch. It is not practical to attend calls every now and then by taking out the handset out of the pouch. Pretty looking nice slim fit. The product image shown here is not the right one. There is no strap at the opening as shown in the image. Please refer to my uploaded image for a clear look at the pouch. Over all nice looking, above average quality product. Using it for less than a week, so cannot predict the durability and stability in the fit. Thought to review little early because I wanted to add the real images so my fellow "best buyers" will get a clear idea rather than getting disappointed to find out there is no strap if that was a buying point for you. I found the package design most interesting and very useful to in-store buyers. Package can be opened and feel the finish and the fit before you buy this product. It is very convenient feature. Best of all, it seems to be a Best Buy exclusive item :)
I just purchased this at the store. It seems like a nice case and reasonably well made, with a small amount of padding, for the price. But I want to let you know that the picture is decieving. There is NOT a strap across the top to keep the phone from sliding out. This might not be an issue, but time will tell if the case stretches any. If you have any kind of case (like the ones that offer some protection of the sides and back), the phone wont fit.
I always loved the leather case that came with my Blackberry and was disappointed I couldn't find anything similar when I changed to an Android phone. I was SO happy to see that they had this available for my iPhone. I don't like cases that are on them when using the phones - I prefer something like this that protects it when not in use.
I really am glad I have this case. My phone has gotten wet a few times, and I don't have any problems with it because I have my lifeproof case on. I just wish it came in different colors for girls to choose from.
I bought this product because I have a pool and I drop my phone all the time. Since this case was waterproof and shockproof I thought it was perfect for me. BUT I was wrong! I tested the case just like the box said and there were no holes and no leaks. I put my phone in the case and had it in there for 2 months. Also it was in the pool about 6-7 times and never leaked. I dropped it a bunch of times and that must have made it crack open. I was in the pool the other day and my phone started to leak! I took my phone out but it was too late! My phone had water damage. I noticed a small little crack in the bottom of the case that made the water come though. So yes the case may be waterproof but only if you DO NOT drop your phone. Which the box says the case protect from dropping. This product is a BIG waste of money! I had to buy a new phone that cost me 300 dollars and I couldn't return the case because it was after 30 days so I lost that money too.
Good product for being waterproof. I dropped my phone in the pool and not a drop of water got inside. Sometimes when I charge the phone I have problems getting the plug in and out of my phone correctly and I cannot use the silent button on the side of the phone at all. I have to turn the volume down all the way, that's kind of a pain. All in all I would recommend this phone....although I think the price is too high for this product I would still recommend it.
Does a great job of protecting the phone but people complain they cannot hear me well and I also cannot hear others well.
Was looking for a camera for family events that produced quality pictures, but not priced like a professional camera. We have an easy to use camera that produces quality images with lots of capability for a great price.
might be pricey but it is very much worth the price
I bought this cover for my granddaughter's iPhone. She has gone thru 4 phones in a year and a half do to water damage. This cover is made for durability and will save her phone from any kind of damage.
If you're seriously around water all the time - on a boat, by the pool, etc - this is for you, but for a price. I thought it was a bit expensive, but nice that it's water-proof. Plugging-in things like headphones or your charging chord are pretty difficult if not sometimes impossible.
I purchased the Lifeproof case for a new iPhone 4. iPhone4 was not used without the case. Less than 2 months after purchase, the phone was dropped from a distance of less than 3 feet. The iPhone screen shattered. I contacted Lifeproof, who were not very nice, and did not even offer any apologies or anything. I called Best Buy customer service, which was fantastic and helped me. I am still stuck with the broken iphone, and will likely have to replace the screen myself. I will never purchase another lifeproof case and do not recommend this case for protection against drops. I had several iphones before this, all that were protected with Otterboxes... had no problems with any of them... I will be purchasing one of those once I fix my screen.
While this case claims to be waterproof, I was not comfortable testing it, with my phone in it, in water. In order to charge the phone, the case either has to come off, which isn't easy, or you have to purchase a separate charger that is expensive. The idea is definitely enticing, but I wouldn't drop it in a pool of water to test it's claim.
Took it back. Item wasn't cost effective ...way too expensive. Main reason for return was the case was bulky, big, and wouldn't fit in the pocket of my purse or jeans. Too big and hard to text with.
I love this case. It is a little pricey, but worth it. I feel confident letting my grandchildren play games on my iPhone, because I know that this case will keep it totally protected from drools, spills, and accidental drops. To be honest that is the main reason I purchased it. What's not so great is my Verizon car charger won't fit with the case on, only my apple home charger fits, so I have to always make sure I have my phone fully charged before I go anywhere. Another thing great about this case is that nothing is affected by it, the keyboard, sound, etc. For the protection you get from this case, it also nice and sleek.
Really like the case. Don't like the headphone adapter or the need to have to use an Apple charger to connect.
Nothing seemed better for protecting my wife's phone but when she talked to e, it sounded as if she was using a voice changer or had turned into Darth Vader. Returned this & went to OtterBox.
Great case I love it! I use it all the time fishing, hunting, on the boat and on the beach. It keeps the inside dry while I can still take pictures in the rain or standing in the surf. Works great only downside is that it does not float!!
Bought this case for my 10 year old daughter as she uses this on my I-4 that she uses as her's (was our old home phone). The case worked well however after a month she noticed the yellow stopper on the bottom was missing and I called Lifeproof they are sending a replacement after sending a photo and proof of purchase. I will be sending the cover back. So far I have replaced my personal case (which leaked some humidity after a few weeks) directly by Best Buy (under 30 days of purchase) and this. I would still buy it again. Do follow the instruction and water test the case before use-there could be a factory defect! Wish they would come out with a lanyard and float to assure you don't drop it in the bottom of the sea!
Easy to install & excellent protection for iphone. Difficult to remove 3rd party car charger will not fit into connector opening
I absolutely LOVE this case! I ordered it because I wanted something waterproof for a 20th anniversary cruise. It works perfectly. So well in fact, that my 18 year old son got one too. It's gorgeous, the display is crisp and clean, everything is still easy to use and sounds fine so don't listen to the complainers. Everyone asks me what kind of case it is and where I got it. You should see the people's faces when you go underwater with your iPhone :) GO get this case!
I was so happy to find a case that would adequately protect my new IPhone. When you make a purchase of a costly item, such as this mobile phone, it's good to know that it is protected from water, sand, dirt, spills, etc. I chose the purple color, which makes it easy to find as it stands out a bit more than the typical black or white. I would definitely recommend the LifeProof Case for the Apple IPhone 4S.
The cover broke over the connection port within the first 90 days. Not what I would have expected.
This is the perfect case for anyone, whether your outdoors, indoors, this case protects your phone and is still thin enough to fit into ur pocket. It covers the entire phone and doesn't interfere with typing or touch sensitivity..... Totally love it!!! Just can't wait for the arm band!!!
I don't really like the look or the feel of it once you get it on your phone. It may be waterproof but I was reluctant to try and figure it out.
this is a great case, keeps phone safe from spills and drops. I dropped my phone the other day and it was fine. I'm sure with out this case I would have to get another phone. Also good for those spills that happened. Spilled coffee and just wiped the case clean. Nice bit of protection and I got it in my favorite color..
While my wife was using her phone while in the kitchen, she droped this case with her phone into the skink full of soap and water, after she screamed that she droped it she grabbed it out. We opened the case and the phone was safe and dry as a bone. thinks lifeproof!
I am not sure if anyone else has had this problem, but when my wife put her iPhone 4s into this case everyone she talk to could hear an echo, usually a bad echo. When she took her phone out, crystal clear talking. I would not recommend this case to anyone.
I decided to go from one of those incase cases to lifeproof after nearly breaking my phone to pieces. I have geek squad protection on my phone but I have a high tendency to drop my phone quite a bit so i got it and its fallen in the pool and everything and my phone is still 100% functional. It's a bit of a pain to use your headphones or to turn up the volume but it's a small price to pay for a near indestructible case.
These cases are awesome! I recently got a purple one after having a black one for almost a year (wanted a color change). You won't find a better case than a LifeProof case. I've had tons of different iPhone cases over the years and this one kills them all. You can beat the heck out of these things and they will keep your phone protected no matter what you throw at it. The best part is when you're out with some friends and you drop your phone into a pitcher of beer and watch their faces... PRICELESS!
I have black, white and purple cases from lifeproof. These cases are simply amazing. Sleek, slim, survives drops and is waterproof. Won't stick to your pocket and all phone functions are fully functional with the case on. Won't ever use any other case.
This is a great case it keeps your phone safe while looking great ..purple is super nice and really pops with the black trim ..the case is sleek tough waterproof and cool ! You will never use another case and the company is great ! I have one in every color and everyone I know with an iPhone now has one!
Read the fine print...the company does NOT stand behind product! Phone was fine in the cheap cases...invest in the $80 case and phone shatters. Waste of $$...DON'T BOTHER!
I bought my lifeproof case took it a lot of places then i started to notice scratches then a week later I gave my nephew it to play with in the bathtub and then I saw water in the inside of the case so Im going to take it back and get another one. If I can or maybe contact lifeproof cause it's a amazing case. Too bad it's broke
This thin is GREAT! Im a teacher and a full time mom! All of my kids swim and its great that i dont have to worry about my phone!
I bought this case because my 6 year old plays on my phone a lot and drops it a lot. My only problem with it is that plugging anything in to it (ear buds, charger) is difficult. You have to have an adaptor for the ear buds and some after-market chargers won't fit in the small opening for the charger. I might have reconsidered buying this case if I had known those two things, but it does protect your phone....my daughter has already put it to the test!
Great case and so far no regrets with the price. Feels safe with it around water and seems to still take clear pictures.
While I really do love the protection this cover provides I do wish it was smaller. It is not as bulky as the Otter but for a female it doesn't fit well in a front pocket. Other than that it was worth the purchase price for protecting your phone.
A splendid case if you are prone to dropping in water, dropping on concrete, use it in dust or sand or generally do not take care of your phone. However, if you are a normal user and enjoy the iPhone's great screen, watch videos, listen to music, view pics etc, this case is not for you.
We bought this case because our 9 month old loves to play with our iPhones. So far it has passed the high chair drop and the chew tests.
Well, the good news is my phone cannot, get wet! Other than that I wish that I wish It was easier to press the buttons. The camera always gets smudges on the lens and the case always has fingerprints on it. I am constant ly having to clean my screen. For the price I would think it would resist smudges more and be easier to type a number
I love the case and didn't believe what it can do until I did the water test. My phone fell a few times but nothing happen to it yet. Still waiting for my phone to fall in water but not just going to but it in water. Did the water test without phone in side.
Great case for protection, but hard to attach accessories such as ear phones and auxillary cables. Unless the bottom latch is open, the speakers are very muffled.
So after having suerged my iPhone 4 in the bathtub TWICE (stupid I know), I decided to get the case for my new phone. I had a regular case and somehow the phone still managed to function with only minor problems. I love the fact that the life proof is waterproof, however it is so inconvenient to use. I always use my headphones to talk when I'm driving or the aux cable to listen to music. So the little screw in part is never inside the case. I've lost it once already. And if I want to play music in my dock of my home theater, the case has to come completely off. Charging is also a hassle, as is texting. So I've smartened up and now I just don't bring the phone with me in the bathroom. And I'm not a fisherman so it's not like I'm around lots of water. And speaker quality is def decreased. I would have gotten a refund but I lost my receipt. So I'm stuck with a case I don't use. I guess for some it's perfect but there are too many cons versus pros for my use.
This is a great case and really protects my phone, I had an otter box but it was bulky
Had case for 2 months. My 12 month old was in his stroller in our bathroom when he got the phone and dropped it on the tile floor from a height of about 15". Shattered the glass. I'm furious!
My brother got me this case for my birthday. I loved it because I love Hello Kitty. It looked super cute. Unfortunately, the first time I dropped my phone, the case cracked and a corner of it broke off causing it not to clip onto the phone properly. It protected my phone from the fall, but the case no longer worked properly after. In short, DURABILITY SUCKS. One drop and game over.
I am a huge Hello Kitty fan and bought this when I found it at FYE. It is a very cute case however, doesn't provide full coverage for my iPhone. It came with a screen protector but I had to throw it away because it has stickers on both sides of the cover. The case itself is nice but again, doesn't provide complete coverage for the iPhone. I noticed a tiny crack on the bottom of my phone where the case doesn't cover it so I had to get a new phone. Also, this thing is easy to put on but is very difficult to remove. I had a hard time trying to remove it twice now and I almost had to bend the case to get it to come off.
I bought this case at best buy the other day and I love it! I am a huge hello kitty fan and this case is great. It fits the phone perfectly and looks great!
I wasn't sure I could get away from my Blackberry. Well it was a short learning curve. I like the apps, the speed of the camera. the battery life is a little disappointment, not as good as my blackberry.
Great phone - great features. With all the features I'm more organized than ever.
i got this for a friend of mine that has never owned a mobile phone before and within 3 days he was addicted to it. the only phone better is the 4s
This is my second iPhone. I got t upgraded at bestbuy mobile store. They made the upgrade process hazzle free by transferring my data from old phone to new one at the same time keeping my existing unlimited data plan untouched. They also gave a good deal on trading my old iPhone. Highly recommend bestbuy mobile store and iPhone
This is a really GOOD phone. I wouldnt say great, because it does have its issues with crashing during apps and what not. A lot of people put Apple products down, but this is my 3rd apple product (2nd iPhone) and I love it. My fiancee and I live apart, and the FaceTime is making things a lot easier when I am able to see her every day.
I love it. It is so easy to use. Sorry I didn't upgrade sooner.
This phone is great. It took a few days to get used to it after using Android and Blackberry systems in the past. Now, I don't know why it took so long to make the change! Best touch screen of any phone I have ever used.
This is one of the best purchases that I ever made, I can't do without it, I saw others with the iphone and didn't think I would want one, but yes I got one and I've very pleased, happy, it's everything you could need . My other concern is they could have given me a better deal, I was very upset with Best Buy for charging me to install the screen saver that came off. I went back up and they would not credit me, I was upset about that and she have been given a refund, the person who put it on didn't know what they were doing and it cost me.
great phone moved from android to apple will never look back
This is the 4the iPhone our family owns. It is easy to use, great apps, all around perfect for what we need.
If you love Itunes Get this phone! You will not be disappointed-
The combination of gorgeous new hardware, that amazing display, upgraded cameras, and major improvements to the operating system make this an extremely formidable package. Worth the money, every dime!!!
I replaced my old iPhone with this one. It was easy to accomplish at Best Buy, and it was virtually free after a trade-in on my old phone and an iPod that I was no longer using because I bought an iPad. I'm glad I made the upgrade.
I love my Iphone 4. I purchased an android and I hated it, took it back within 3 days and paid the extra money for the Iphone. It was worth ever penny.
I'm enjoying the fact that I can do most anything on this phone.
I have had my iPhone 4 White on AT&T for about 2 weeks and i love it!!! It looks sharp and it is lightning fast! This is the best smartphone because it is a PDA,iPod, and a Smartphone. I use my iPhone 4 to help me in school! It has over 500,000, Apps in the apple app store a and almost half of them are FREE! I always get completes on my White iPhone 4! Some people may tell you to get the iPhone 4 in black but their are many advantages to having it in white. Some advantages are you don't see the scratches as easily as as black, it reflects the sun instead of a sorbing it, and you will get many compliments. I have a clear case with a built in white bumper that i bought at best buy. I LOVE the WHITE IPHONE 4! I WILL NEVER BUY A ANDROID CELL PHONE AGAIN EVER!!!
I strongly recommend the iPhone to anyone. It's the best phone available!! Once you use the iPhone once you will neve want to change it. You can use it for anythin!!
I owned a 3Gs before this phone and was reluctant to give it up. However, when I decided I wanted facetime, I did get the I phone 4. It is so much fun and much faster to use. I refer to it more to look up things on the net than I do my desk top.
I find myself using my iPhone for maps and traffic more than my car GPS. it is always handy for web browsing to check produce info or get prices. Weather, stocks, and sport reports are super to have anytime. Then there is always a game to play while the wife shops.
No complaints. Phone does what it should do. As with all apple products, it appears flawless. This is my third generation of iPhone and I look forward to the next release.
Need to get into more available options! So many to get into.
I love my phone although I did break the crystal already. AN otter case is a must!
Love love love this phone! It's the greatest smart phone!
I love this phone, I can do everything with it. I think its awesome, I definitely recommend this phone!
I enjoy all but one aspect of the iPhone 4. I upgraded from an iPhone 3 mainly for the camera features on the new phone. However, there is a major draw back to the sensitivity of the touch screen. I am not an overweight person. My adult nephew, Trevor, is actually quite skinny. This said, I have a constant issue with the MUTE button being activated when I am holding the phone to my head. Trevor warned me of this before I bought it, but I just thought maybe he got a faulty phone. NOPE.
I love it. Coming from a 3GS u can see the difference in display pix and games and movies videos the list can go on :) I love the bright flash and the retina display. It's faster and has better features ..... I HIGHLY recommend.
love this phone, so far it covers all the bases...
I'm actually on my second iPhone4 (the first was stolen). It is a very capable smartphone, with an easy to use interface, and lots of possible add-ons. Although this late in the life cycle (July '11), I'd recommend waiting for the next 4S or 5 version to come out. Those are likely to be the same cost as a current 4, and if you don't think you need the extra features the 4 will likely take a price drop.
I had an iPhone 3G so upgrading to the White iPhone 4 was way over due. Compared to this phone I guess my 3G was Grandpa. White iPhone 4 is a great phone its fast, sexy, and worth the upgrade. I also bought Bestby's buy back program, so when the iPhone 5 comes out if i want to get it they will buy back my White iPhone 4 for $300 within 6 month. After six months the price goes down, but anyways great phone love it to death. Always had an iPhone always will. Sorry Android just aren't my type. Everyone has different tastes and wants and mine is the "White" Apple iPhone 4.
This phone just is ten steps ahead of my old one (BB 9700). The apps really make the phone like I can use this to manage my cable DVR and run multiple social networking sites at once. The battery life is just as good as my blackberry's but this iPhone is way more attractive.
Got this for my husband and he loves it. It was easy to show him how to use it. I have an earlier model and am thanking of getting this one in Feb.
I pre-ordered this phone back in the summer of last year, and couldn't get it. I went with the black model instead, but as soon as I saw this coming out, I bought one. I liked my black one, but I've always loved the white iPhones. This one is better than any previous model!! It just looks so clean! All my friends that have iPhones want to check mine out, but I love it too much to allow that to happen!!! IOS is great! I've owned an Android phone, and I still prefer IOS on my phone. Now let's not get into the huge debate on which is better, because what it comes down to is personal preference!
The product words well, will charge an iPhone 4 from nearly dead to 90%. The Micro-usb does not provide a secure connection all of the time. In my car, with the iPhone connected to stereo it will disconnect and reconnect over and over again whenever I hit a bump in the road.
It's great having extra battery life for my phone. However, it takes several hours to charge the case. Even slower if your phone and case are charging at the same time. Case loses battery life quickly and rarely has enough charge to fully charge my phone
There are a lot of battery cases out there and they all cost quite a bit. I had a cheaper one for a while and it worked, until the micro usb port started to go bad and charging was a hassle. I decided to pay a little more for quality and bought the juice pack air (from a mophie partner so it was not counterfeit.). I am not disappointed. It looks great and functions perfectly. It feels great in my hands. The LED lights even manage to be beautiful. The color is perfect for my black iPhone 4S. The case also features an acoustic design that I did not expect to work as well as it actually does. I was shocked the first time I heard something at full volume. Also, my last battery case produced a glare in pictures when I used the LED flash (camera housing was built in such a way that it would reflect light back into the lens). This case does not do that to my pictures. Two small things I am not too keen on: The micro USB port is in a weird spot on the bottom right side (phone facing you) of the case, and if you use a USB cable in your car then you are going to be limited by the cables you can use. Because of the design of the jack, most micro USB cables cannot fit all the way inside the plug. The cable that comes packaged with the case is capable of relaying data between the two, but most of my other micro USB cables will only charge while driving, and not play music.
This case provides good protection for my 16 year-old's phone. Has protected against several drops during the first few days.
Only had this case for a month, the corners cracked off, and the logo scratches off, and wears off too easily. Buy a more rugged case, this is of a cheaper quality but looks nice.
This product is great for a person who needs a phone fast. It is easy to use and very thin. Something I don't really like is that its heavy, if it was a little bit lighter, it would be great. It frozed a couple times so I had to hold the lock/unlock and the home button at the same time for a couple seconds. If you are a texter, its good but you might press the wrong letter. The screen's resolution is good and the camera is good. The batter life is not that much, it needs more. I had been using this for about a year now and know everything about it. The sound is good but not Bose good. I recommend you use a screen protector because it will scratch at about a day.
Great deal!! Who can complain about an iPhone 4!! What a steal!!
Like most Apple products, the thing just works. Not the fastest but not the slowest. Battery life is acceptable at 12 to 18 hours of constant use between phone pics and texting with a little web surfing thrown in. Apps selection is excellent. Now that It is free how can you go wrong, unless you gotta have SIRI?????
I love hello kitty items. The rating for this case is average. The case is cute and easy to keep clean. The case however comes off very easy.
Another good ifrogz case. I got the pink and black one for my wife. She's not a "pink" kind of girl, but shee is more than happy with it.
This is a good sturdy cover. Needed a temp case for my phone. This is great.
The product is great when you drop your phone it is well protected!
I really like the feel and purpose of the cover....however within 2 weeks the finish color (pink and black) began to crack and chip off around the edges that surround the face of the phone. I don't ever remove the cover, which may stretch that edge and it still did this???????? Maybe a solid black one would not do this?
I bought this for a present. My buddy loves to tweek out his car and this Fiber looking like case cover just makes him feel faster while driving... yes it feels like you are a half a pound lighter... He maybe a bit more FAST, but he is still NOT THAT FFFUURRIIOOUSSSS!
This case does do a good job of protecting the phone if you drop it but the biggest problem I have is that around the screen on my phone I have a bunch of scratches from the hard case rubbing against it. I now use a screen protectors to help but of course the edges of that get all scratched up too.
I bought this case for the iphone4 and I have been satisfied so far, I have dropped it a few times and it didn't come apart or crack so its been sturdy, also fits good with the zagg screen protector.
The case works as advertised, but be careful if you're using your iPhone as your primary point and shoot camera. You can see a noticeable glare in the lense if you're standing under a light source while taking the picture. The glossy rim around the camera reflects stray light into the lens.
Been dropped numerous times and protected my iPhone 4S fine. Also relatively thin so I'd recommend this product.
This case works really well with the zagg screen protector. Also, the inside material of the case protects the glass on the back of the iPhone. However, after one drop, the case cracked. Now, one of the corner pieces won't stay latched. Don't buy this case at the Apple store...it's $5 more expensive there. Case looks good, keeps the phone nice, but doesn't hold up as well as other cases.
I've had three cases for my iPhone 4. The Otterbox which was way too bulky, the Switcheasy, which was nice but got lose from removing a few times, and this case. This case is great because it DOES NOT cause problems with screen protectors. The front of the case lies on top of it; which has been my number one problem with the Switcheasy Rebel. It is real slick and classy looking. Easy access to all buttons, especially the Verizon iPhone even on the top and bottom, very easy access to charge. It is a little pricey but not near as much as the Otterbox which cost me $50. I would recommend this case to anyone.
Works with a screen protector and protects the phone well.
I don't know about other griffin products, they look pretty great, but this one is just completely useless. It's two parts that click together around the iPhone 4, easy to use, right? Well easy to break apart as well: 2 corners have been broken off And the biggest concern and evidence of money thrown away: ****EVERY SINGLE TIME it falls it pulls apart, and each piece flies in separate directions, not to mention the iPhone flies in a third one on the pavement or floor**** It's got one darn job: protect the * iPhone! It fails miserably at it. Sure it saves it from table hairline scratches, but that's it. Oh! And one more thing: It develops these weird marks around the edges of the actual iPhone. DO NOT BUY. Buy another product.
Allow for non-slip handling. Show's off the iPhone while providing non-slip on almost any surface. It does not last forever.
Love it!!! But will like it in clear or more options in colors
As stated in other reviews, the white version of this case will turn blue on the edges after one time in your jeans pocket. Although I was disappointed in this, it got much worse. Within a few weeks, the white looked horribly dirty. I could not get the dirt off either. Loved this case at first since it really complemented/showed off my white iPhone. I am presently looking for a new case. Durability seems good too. Just looks filthy as it picks up any dirt on the silicone bumper.
After just a couple of days use, I noted that the case didn't seem so white as when initially purchased. Over time, it became clear that the silicone case was picking up color from my pocket, or wherever it was stored. Since I chose this white case to compliment my white iPhone, I ended up taking it back and replacing with a hard case instead. No problems with the replacement though - thanks Best Buy!
This a One-piece polycarbonate shell with ultra-thin rubber interior lining accents. I got this in White for Iphone 4. Great about this case it has thin profile without add of bulk. Clear plastic back protection for the back of the iphone 4 looks great but scratches too easy. The rubber piece slides in easy custom fit the surrounding of the iphone fits properly. Another bad thing about this case is after one week of use, rubber attracts dirt easily turning white case discolored and dirty looking. Also putting in my pants front pocket got blue smudges.Its hard to clean on the rubber edge even with soap on rubber. My suggestion if you like this case to get Black not White it get dirty too easy, If you carry things in your pockets mix in with keys, coins and etc. This will get scratch easy making the clear plastic back piece cheap looking. I return it to best buy and got Incase brand.
This is a really good case. The price is inexpensive, and the look is very nice and clean. The case is very durable and not difficult to keep clean. Also, this case is very light and thin. Overall a great case. I have a short video review posted below as well. Check it out if you like and see a quick video review of the case. Hope this helps.
Um this case, did not live up to what I was hoping. I like that the back is clear so the apple logo shows but what good does it do when the case fogs your photos. When the flash is used the pictures are washed out, fogged, hazy, whatever you want to phrase it as. I WILL return this case and get my money back!!!! You have been warned.
I really liked this case. That is why it pains me now to say that this white one is not a good idea. Unless you are very very careful with it, it starts to discolor after a few weeks. Get a different color somewhere else or the Black one here at Best Buy.
I exchanged the Belkin Grip Vue case for this one today and I have to say that I really like it so far. My two biggest complaints about the Belkin case were that using the flash washed out my pictures and that I couldn't use my AUX cables in the headphone jack without removing the case. I tested the cable and it works fine with this case. Also tested the flash a little by taking a picture inside a drawer and there was no wash in the picture. Of course, I can't know for sure until I take more pictures but I think this case is going to be great!
I am a die-hard fan of the ifrogz cases; which is what I bought after getting my new iPhone 4. After ripping 4 screen protectors, back it went along with the mutilated screen protectors. I had the same bad luck with Hard Candy and Belkin cases as well. However, this case works just perfectly. I too wish the bumper was a little bit more sturdy. And more colors would be nice. :-) But for the money and functionality, it suits my needs and protects my phone and I can use a screen protector as well.
I haven't had it too long, but this is one of the best iphone cases I've used. It feels sturdy, but as previous reviews have stated, the rubber can feel flimsy compared to the official bumper. Then again, it's not loose by any manner and it certainly doesn't feel like it'll break under normal use. The clear plastic back gives me a lot more piece of mind with the phone. Now if there were only some decent screen protectors I'll feel safe ;-) Seriously though - this case is good - and doesn't add much to the size.
I am basing my review against all the other cases out there. I have tried and returned the others (other ifrogz case, the bump from apple, etc.) this case is capable of holding a screen protector, it is light and durable, easy to hold etc...pick this up!
I created a BB login just to write this review. This is a "DON'T BUY" product ! The main issue is with is functionality. It is totally worthless when using your flash ! If you are like me, the flash feature was much anticipated on the iPhone4. With this case, you can't use the flash at all because the clear plastic is too close to the led creating a glare in the lens. In order to get a clear picture w/flash you have to remove the case completely. The other issue I have with this $30 case is the flimsy piece of rubber on the bottom in front of the dock connection. I could see this not lasting very long at all. The bottom line, if you want cheap junk buy a knock-off for less than $10.
I got the black version of it. It looks awesome with my black iphone 4. I went to BB with intention of buying Belkin Grip Vue. But I saw Griffin case and it looked very nice. It is well designed and there is no problem in pressing volume or sleep/wake buttons (both totally covered). Silent button is very easy to access as there is a big cutout for it. Overall I'm very happy with this case. It is extremely light and doesn't make phone bulky. Back of phone is totally visible with clear plastic.
I bought this case for the same reason another reviewer did, something temporary until more cases are available. Overall I feel that this case is pretty good, but I wouldnt exactly trust it to handle a harsh drop to well. It offers pretty good protection and allows the beautiful phone to be seen but I dont think it is that durable. This case would be best used as a second case or an alternate.
The Griffin case is good overall but I soon discovered that it dramatically affects your picture quality while using the flash. Guess the plastic backing material is close enough to the LED light that it causes a lot of glare. I had to use the flash today at a job site and had to take off the case in order to use the flash. What's the point of having a case when you can't really use it? I don't write reviews much... but felt this was important enough to give a DON'T BUY THIS CASE review.
I picked this case up (and the ifrogz 3 pack of anti glare screen protectors) the day I got my iphone as I needed something to tide me over until I had better option for casing. After I tried out the case for the first time I was very pleased at how well it fit and how much protection it offers. The only downside is that the material does have a tendency to stretch and warp just a tad but that is just me being picky. If it weren't for the quick nature of the plastic back to scratch I would give this case 5 stars.
I was very excited to find iPhone 4 cases at a local Best Buy. I just wanted some sort of protection until more cases are widely available. I "settled" for this one. However, after getting it on my phone and using it for a day I think this may be my permanent solution! The case looks awesome on the phone and I feel like it protects it well, too. The rubbery edges give a good grip and there is plastic on the back. There is no screen protection, so I will need to buy that separately. There may be a slight issue with my car connection cable (dock connector) not staying in all the way, but I'm not sure how bad that is yet. The standard iPod cable from apple stays in fine, so it might just be the design of the cable in my car. I love this case!
After recieving my iPhone 4, it became clear I needed a good quality case to protect my investment. This case is just that; the case is both stylish and protective. The case itself has a clear, hard plastic back (something the Apple bumper lacks) for good protection. Since this back is clear, you can easily admire the beautiful phone's design. The white bumper is also handy for gripping the phone and being quite stylish (also keeping the bulkiness level to a minimum). All in all, this is a great product I will always recommend.
the case is actually pretty nice looking- soft white rubber covering around the metal edge around the case with a clear plastic cover on the back. there is no front protection. it is well made and comfortable to hold. however, the issue is the cutout around the back camera lens and flash. and this is in no way isolated to just this case or this particular manufacturer. the shiny clear plastic case immediately surrounding the flash reflects the light when the flash is used and causes the actual photo to have a white wash/glare effect. this ruins the photo. using the camera/video function when you are not using the flash is not a problem.
I am glad I read the one review here as I thought it was my problem. I bought the AP1201 on Quid Bid and it would not work. XPAL immediately and happily replaced it. It worked for a couple of months and the USB connector separated from the device. XPAL again quickly re[placed it at no charge top me. This one lasted about 3 months and then stopped taking a charge. When I wrote XPAL 4 times they will not answer. So I was going to buy it from Best Buy before I read the review and determined that I am wasting money to do so. I wish they would fix the durability as it is a great product when it works. It does not add mush weight or size and adds so much time to battery life. But as it is you will waste money.
I've had two of these pieces of garbage and I'm getting my money back later today!! I bought one back in like March or so and after like two months, it wouldn't take a charge. The connection between the case itself and the cord where you plug it into the case, wasn't making contact. I called the company and they were VERY helpful in getting me to UPGRADE from the AP-1201 that I had to the AP2100 for another $35.00. I waited till it showed up and everything was fine until yesterday when I went to go charge it up and the same thing is happening. It looks good, feels sturdy and worked as it was supposed to but for like $80, it should last longer than a few months!!! I'm getting my money back and WILL NEVER BUY AN XPAL POWER PRODUCT AGAIN!! DON't WASTE YOUR MONEY!!
This thing was extremely hard to get an iPad plugged into. Had to wedge a piece of plastic behind the connector just to get it to work. After 1 day there was no sound coming out of speaker. I am returning it soon and will not be getting another!
i bought for my 8 year old son for christmas he connects his iPod and absolutely loves it. It is very user friendly!
I was initially skeptical of this unit but I was on the market for a compact speaker system that would work with my 4G iPod touch, iPad 2, and Droid X. I looked at models from other brands that incorporated clocks but they all seemed to lack sound quality, build quality, and/or they provided quirky performance. Being an AngryBirds fan, I was immediately drawn to this. The bird is actually quite compact taking up very little space. My iPad overshadows this by a large margin. It easily fit on my small night stand and has a smaller footprint than most other speaker docks in this price range. The sound quality also surprised me. I wasn't expecting this small setup to do much but it can easily fill my bedroom with music that isn't distorted. The bass isn't going to rattle your walls but I feel that the sound quality is better than others at this price (I have only experienced 7 models, one from Sony and 6 from iHome). This will fully charge modern iPods, iPhones, and iPads though it does not state anything about working with legacy iPods. The manual and box also state that the 1G iPod touch won't work with this. The included remote has a rather long range and offers some basic controls. I was able to select certain songs, playlists, artists, albums, etc on my iPod all with the remote. I can highly recommend this for people who want a compact solution with surprisingly nice sound quality that can easily fill a kitchen, bedroom, dining room, garage, or even a workout room. The only things I have against it is the lack of a large built-in clock and the lack of compatibility with alarm apps that would put my iPod to sleep after a certain amount of time.
I was pleasantly surprised with this speaker. My girlfriend and I are huge Angry Birds fans and she got this for me as a gift and I love it far. Does exactly what I need and more.
I do love this case, especially in the bright green that pops bright off of my black iPhone 4S. I think it has great style. The one problem is that it doesn't protect the phone. It has a lip so it won't touch a surface, but it still is open so when you are texting you are putting your fingernails on the back and could end up scratching it. I think it is nice, but to keep it in a pocket while moving could be risky, with a glass phone. If you get this case I recommend a screen cover on the front and the back. Just in case. I gave it five stars because it is worth them. It is really opinion to think it is unsafe. It depends on you.
Apple makes great products! I recommend them to everyone!
I'm very happy with this phone. One of the reasons I switched back to the iPhone was iTunes. Although Android had an decent music interface, apples music interface is far superior. If your considering a new phone that's easy to use this phone meets that need.
I have had every generation iPhone since the 2nd generation, the iPhone 3G. This is by far the best phone Apple has made. Their software getter better and better with each update. I use Siri all the time. It's a very helpful and accurate feature. I don't think there is a better phone on the market. People can say, "Well, it doesn't do this...." That's okay with me becuse it does so much more and it works. I don't have to take my battery out and reset my phone. Excellent phone.
This is another great iPhone. The data speeds are much faster than the iPhone 4. It looks great and works well. Just what you expect from an iPhone.
Love my iPhone. Tried many others had to come back. iPhone is just simply the best hands down. The battery you have to do a few full cycles down to get it to not die on you in the middle of the day. The first week is the toughest but after a few full power down cycles battery is good. (hint: get rid of location services on unnecessary apps/remb to turn off bluetooth once you disc your headset) I use my phone everyday all day and never have a problem. My only issue is the white hazing of the some random photos. BB guy said it is a 4s flash issue. We will see... other than that won't leave anywhere without it !
Having had two iPhones, an iMac and an iPad2, I must have had a mental break because I decided to try Android. Five months later I was so disillusioned I paid full price for the 4S. I trust my apps are vetted by Appple, as android market only sells a license to sell apps. Controls are once again familiar, almost intuitive after years of practice. There is no rational reason to change platforms, stay with Apple IOS
I have enjoyed using this phone and it is my first Apple product and since I have purchased an IPad.
Love my iphone After breakin my old iphone 4 i had to definately get te 4s and its just as Great! Siri is so useful too Cant be without it now
I don't really have anything bad to say about my new phone. I have yet to utilize it's full potential. The battery is the only downside along with if you are using 4G sometimes the connection is slow depending on your carrier. I went from a blackberry that still had a track ball to this and I am very pleased so far.
The main reason why I upgraded to the 4S from the 3GS was for memory. However I am very pleased with the additional functions that the 4S gives me, including Siri. While it has proven very useful, it still lacks a few functions. For starters, I can get the quickest route to a destination, but only from my current location. Also, sometimes it misunderstands my voice. The only other complaint I have is with the stainless steel on the phone. If I'm holding it sideways, it feels uncomfortable after a while. Getting a bumper or case would help. The 4S is pretty easy to use, and I love that it can also function like an iPod touch.
Above & beyond all the rest of all smart phones .It's the apps and operating system .
This is my first iPhone and I love it! It is super fast and have so many awesome features!
I purchased my iPhone 4 after I realized all the kids on the block had a better iPhone than me. Most embarassing. This iPhone was worth the wait. SIRI and I are BFFs. I enjoy the iCloud feature to sync my iPad2 and iPhone4. Pics, videos, surfing the net & using the alarm (SIRI sets for me) iPhone 4 doesnt let me down. A must have.
Great all around camera.Great phone good for everything.
Siri is so cool. It's simple to use to use. The photos are beautiful as well.
This is my second iPhone, the 4S is replacing my 3GS, which has now pretty much become an iPod Touch for my daughter. Siri is a great compliment to iPhone experience. Using it to place calls, play a podcast or send a text hands free is great.
Very user friendly, easy to pick up and just go with. Very fast and not much waiting.
There is so much to like about the iPhone 4s. Form factor, look, operating system (especially after having been on Windows Mobile for the past several years). It works for me as phone, email, web tool, and mp3 player. A couple of critiques, the Siri personal assistant could be better with help to launch programs (other than the iOS programs related to contacts, calendar, todos, etc.). Battery life needs to improve, I work around that somewhat by not using push email and just checking the emails when I have time, turning Bluetooth off when not in use, etc. (not a burden for me, but could be problematic for professionals who need those all the time). Other than these, I am glad I purchased this phone.
This is my third generation of iPhones. Each generation gets better and faster and each iOS update brings more and more features that I use daily.
The new iPhone 4S is a must have product that will help with your productivity both at work and at home. With "Siri" (the built in personal assistant) you can do tasks quickly and efficiently with only a single touch of a button. The stability of the operating system will mean that you will not have to reboot/restart your cell phone for months. The free software updates that Apple gives keeps the phone packed with all of the new innovated products that Apples offers.
i upgraded from an iphone 4 so this is not a huge step up...but definitely still noticeable. if you are coming from a 3g or 3gs, the 4s is a huge step up. as most iphone users, i probably will not own another make of phone other than an iphone. its ease of use and simplicity is unparalleled. it has almost completely replaced my laptop. i pay all of my bills online with it, have my online banking set up on it, my personal and work email setup, and receive constant notifications for everything. it is ABSOLUTELY AWESOME!! to clear one thing up... I AM NOT an apple fanboy! I love my i7 quad core, ATI Radeon equipped windows laptop. you can keep your "overpriced for the hardware" macbooks!! But the iphone.....LOVE IT!!! P.S FOR YOU GEEKS.....AS I AM....... JB IT !!!!
70% of the time the phone calls don't connect with each other...I can hear them but they can't hear me or vice versa, unless it is hooked to a bluetooth and all call with go through.
I've had the 3G,3GS,iPhone 4 and now the 4S!i love the 4S it's soo fast with everything like web sites,opening apps,doing anything on it!the graphics are super fast and incredible as well as Suri is a great addition and makes life so much easier!I almost fogot about the camera its the fastest to take the best quality pics from a phone ive ever seen!Dont hesitate just buy it!!!!
My 3GS had less no sound issues! My 4S has a lot of background sounds when I'm on a call!! Sent one back to apple and I will say they were quick, happy and more than willing to replace it!! Which will probably keep me with apple for the long haul because custome service is so important and they were awesome!! New iphone4S has the same back ground noise. Not always there but a lil annoying when it is.
I upgraded from an iPhone 3GS and love the new capabilities of the phone. For me, those capabilities also include what many have already been enjoying with the iPhone 4 such as FaceTime. I was fortunate enough for my pre-order to come in right before a business trip as I was able to use FaceTime to talk with friends and family while on the road. It works great and is a fun way to interact other than the regular voice call. The screen resolution is fantastic, although if you already have an iPhone 4 it might not be such an improvement for you. I use the phone to view YouTube and Netflix streaming from time to time and the picture quality is excellent. The sound quality is better than my 3GS, but is still probably the weak link in the multimedia experience; especially if you are in a place with a fair level of background noise. Then again, that's the case with a lot of smart phones I've played around with. Siri is great when it's available. There have already been a few instances where the service has been down. When it does work though it is amazingly useful. Especially in situations where you can't give your screen your undivided attention. Battery life has been good, but there are things that I do to conserve energy. For example, I turn off Bluetooth, reduce the screen brightness and tweak other settings. In doing so, I only really need to charge up about every other day and I do a lot on my phone. Overall I'm very satisfied with the phone.
I couldn't live without it my business depends on it!!
Awesome features, love the white look, Siri is my new girl friend. phone speed is pretty good. love the speed of operation. would definitely get the next iPhone. Camera is awesome, you can throw your point and shoot cameras away if you got this phone. Battery life is good but has been fading after a few times of letting it drain to less than 20%.
They just work, it isn't the size of brick, fits in any pocket nicely. Works flawlessly, very incredible product. Fit and finish is supreme. The materials it is made out of give it a very high quality feel. The touch screen is so responsive and SIRI is one of the coolest things I have ever experienced. Another home run for the team @ Apple. This is my third iPhone, each time I am amazed at what they come up with. Highly recommend these to anyone!
I just replaced my IPhone 3G phone with the lates IPhone 4S which I bough from Best Buy. And let me tell you the Phone is absolutely amazing. Also Best Buy handled this transfer in very professional and efficient manner. If anyone have not upgraded their IPhone I recommend people to do it as soon as possible. The Camera, SIRI and the Internet Speed everything is absolutely amazing.
Despite some of the really nice features of the phone, such as voice recording of e-mails, texts, etc..., the phone's battery does not last an entire workday, EVEN IF YOU DON'T USE IT!!! Though Apple is allegedly working on the problem, the phone NEVER should have been released. Using this phone, or rather not being able to use it, has been a complete nightmare. Also, the updated "operating system fix" actually made the battery life WORSE, not better.
The iPhone 4s is an exceptional product. Innovative , thoughtful , and user friendly . Any one can easily get the hang of this phone. I prefer this phone in white it gives it a sleek , clean look . The Internet on this phone is blazing fast . It's a great phone and packs a punch .
I had my 3gs for 2 years but it was smashed to pieces in a freak accident. I love my iPhone4s....it's fast and reliable and Siri is sooo much fun!
I have every version of iPhone. The 4s is by far the best. It is smarter than I am! Cannot live without it!
This phone has actually exceeded my expectations! It is fast, responsive, and the camera is fantastic.
Fast beautiful and easy to use. What else can you ask for?
It's a bit faster than the iphone 4, which I had previously. The battery life is considerably worse though. By 5PM I'm down to 35%. Multiple checks to email/facebook/foursquare is all I have done today. Maybe 20 text messages sent/received. So pretty pathetic for battery. Yes, I have auto-dim on and brightness at 75%. WIFI and BT are off. The phone is a lot more snappy compared to the iPhone 4. Sound/volume quality are equal. ATT is my service provider and for some reason I loose 3G often and then it re-connects. Not sure if it's the phone or the service provider. On a positive note the camera and video capabilities are amazing. Very impressive for a phone.
I've had all but the first generation and this is the best yet. The added antennas have boosted my 3G speed (AT&T).
Love this phone. Had a problem with the first one and new one has been fine ever since. Salesman was great except when I was having issues with the first one.
This phone with the A5 processor that is only clocked at 800mhz is faster than any phone on the market right now. iOS5 is very fast and fluid with no lag what so ever. If you are looking for a phone you should definitely get this phone. The apps on iOS are great, fun, and addicting. I moved from an android phone that also has a dual-core processor, but the A5 seemed so much faster. I do not regret moving from Android to iOS, i am happy with my phone and recommend you to get one!
Love it. I had an iphone 3GS 32 gig and it was awesome but what sets this apart for me are a few things.1.Siri.Having come from watching Star trek as a kid I never thought I would see the day, But it has arrived. REAL voice control, Speech to text that works and a helper, for me being a private music teacher, Siri is a God send.It Just works, and Siri has a funny bone as well, But a Real help in planing my day and week out. 2.The Dual core A5 Prosser is fast,3 The 8.0 Megapixel Cam 1080p HD Cam Is just awesome.Can't wait to use facetime and all the awesome apps. as well. The 1080p HD Video is sharp. If you have another phone be it a 3GS or android. Check out The Iphone 4S. I dont think you will be let down.I Think you will be Amazed.
I went form a 16 gb 3gs to the new iPhone 4s and I simply love it!!! Everything on this phone is amazing!!! Siri is absolutely great with all the things it does and it's only a beta still!!! It will get even better. Buy this phone you will love it! I will say do not buy a life proof case for it because they are terrible. Stick to the good old Otter Box for your protection of this phone. The life proof have terrible hearing when on the phone, I've got bad reception with the case on great without it. Stick to the otter box because this phone needs protecting. 90% glass front and back. don't take the chance on breaking it, buy a case. Wonderful phone needs protecting so go buy one!!!
iPhone 4s is a good phone, I'll give it 4.5 stars if I could. Its easy to use, easy to play around with, and it just works. I own a Galaxy S II, Dell Streak, and iPhone 3Gs and this phone is on par with the Galaxy S II. if your looking for something that just pick up and play then the iPhone 4s is it. Its way faster then the 3Gs, Looks good and feels solid. if you have an iPhone 4 I don't think this is for you and I would pass on this phone but us 3Gs owners been looking forward to this for a long time. Screen: While the Screen size is small 3.5 don't let it fool you. its still bright and vibrant and the games look amazing. still one of the best screens on a cell phone so far. Speed: Quick...So quick in everything it does. it blows the 3GS out of the water! any game that is optimize for the 4s certainly does look really good. its crazy because they are all running at a smooth frame rate. Web browsing is super fast I love it to death. don't let anyone tell you otherwise. Again if you have an iPhone 4 this may not be worth it for you. just wait til the iPhone 5 but us 3Gs owners are pleased. I am getting near full speed from AT&T in my area too. (Grandfathered unlimited data user) Apps: Same good apps are in the app store. Almost anything your looking for its almost certain its in the app store. and running perfectly I might add you won't be disappointed. it still has one of the best Ecosystems ever. Calls: Clear and loud for me (your experience may vary) haven't had a drop call yet but then again I am in a better area of AT&T. iOS5 / Siri / Camera: it improves on what was already one of the best mobile OS out there. Notification makes it a much more enjoyable experience. As for Siri, She works good as an assistant. I don't know what all the hype is about her but she does responds really well. just nothing I can see anyone really going crazy over. The cam on this thing is so much better then it ever have been before 1080p looks clean and clear. I'm not fully impressed since I have a Galaxy S II. but if you never seen it before on a phone your going to be happy to have it. Build Quality: Solid and it just feels right in the hand. just don't drop this phone at all. shoulder height will surely break the glass on the back so keep a case on this beauty. The bad: Well, The phone can get warm at times (much like my Samsung Galaxy S II) but this is something I experience with all Dual-core phones for some reason and when it get warm it drains the battery a lot but I haven't had this problem in a few days from my 4s. it seems to be operating normal. Overall: I just want to point out that this phone is not for Android junkies, its just not. if your coming from an android phone and that's all you've been using. I doubt you will be 100% happy especially if your so use to customizations. I suggest you guys get a Samsung Galaxy S II or Galaxy Nexus. But for iPhone owners that had a 3Gs and wanting to upgrade. I suggest you get the iPhone 4s. its a little hard to say if you have an iPhone 4 to feel the need to upgrade unless you want the 64Gb but trust me. the iPhone 4s improves on everything the iPhone before it was. I am pleased with it and glad that I added it to my collection of smartphones and I know you will too. It still have the best ecosystem, it still has the "just work" aspect and it still one of the best phones out there. buy it and enjoy!
its looks exactly like iPhone 4 yet it has more powerful specs and few new cool features. had it been redesigned, i'd give it a 5. siri is very helpful especially when you are driving. the one thing that reminds me i'd upgraded is that the one i got is white. (i had black on 4). all in all, this phone is still amazing despite being exactly look like an iPhone 4. unless you're a real techie, you wouldn't mind upgrading. who would thought you're holding a 4s, unless they start asking "can i try the sir?". :-/
I love my iPhone 4S! The battery life isn't what I expected but it might be because I have alot of apps. I am deleting the unused ones one by one. THe pics are awesome and love the front facing camera. I upgraded from 3GS so it is a big upgrade!
I swear by these, be sure to register this with Zagg because they will for real replace it if you can scratch or damage it! No questions asked!
The last screen protector I got did a great job at protecting but I couldn't appreciate the clarity of the screen on my phone. This protector does both jobs! I don't have to worry about my keys scratching it up or anything else that is in my purse. There are a few small dents where the "liquid" has protected the screen but it doesn't puncture or cut the plastic. I did happen to notice that a key started pulling on the plastic close to the speaker and camera. I just laid it back down and it was as good as new. If a few smudges don't bother you then you should be ok with this screen protector. Plus it has a lifetime warranty!
Great great screen protector it is clear! When igot he phone the best buy person put on there perfectly. Highly recommend
Ive always preferred the riged screen protectors. Although this is soft it's very clear. It also doesn't feel like your finger is sticking to the screen.
I like the cover, it seems very easy to clean and wipe off.
The older model stuck to my wallet and came off so i bought the HD version and wow what a big difference in the clarity. It is night and day difference. Even the feel is much smoother then its predecessor. Installation was pretty straight forward and simple.
A must for any smartphone owner! This product does not interfere with the touch sensitivity of my iPhone and makes me feel like my phone has a little Kevlar vest on.
I bought the upscale model and paid a little extra to have it installed for me at the store. Good move. They do not install as easy as the instructions read and with expert hands it went on perfectly and have had no trouble.
These Zag protectors are a must have. I use them on all my devices. Best of all, Best Buy installed for free. Sucks if you get hair or dust under it, but thats why I had them do it. Keeps the screen like new, just peel and replace if scratched.
Disappointed that the shield smears so fast and easily.
I don't know alot about screen protectors for smartphones, and this one was suggested by the Best Buy Mobile store when i bought my phone. They said the HD screen protectors are the way to go since i had a iPhone 4s - i don't know if i could tell the difference or not between a regular and a HD screen protector. All i know is that it protects my iphone screen and there aren't any large or visible bubbles on it that annoy me - i had the mobile guy put it on the phone for me. It looked like applying the screen to the phone was a little difficult - he had to use 3 different screens and it tool him 15 to 20 minutes. One of the screens had part of the logo cut on it, so it was a bad screen to begin with and the other kept getting smugged or had stuff getting stuck to it. I would HIGHLY recommend paying to have them put it on just in case there is a bubble or something wrong with the screen, that way they can just pull a new one off the shelf and you don't have to buy another one or return one that has a flaw. Make them keep putting it on until your happy b/c you're the one that has to look at the screen everyday.
Good cover. Would recommend if you drop phones a lot.
This shield protects the screen on my phone well. It keeps fingerprints and dust off of it, and protects it from scratches.
I've been very satisfied with the InvisibleShield HD for my iPhone. It is very durable, scratch resistant, and easy to clean. It is worth the money over the static cling type covers that rarely bond properly and bubble up, sometimes right away. Of course, this screen protector is highly dependent on how well it is installed. I installed one on my iPad successfully but it was a pain, and decided it was better to let Best Buy install this one. Worth the 7 bucks. The minor bubbles that may be there initially, go away within a day or so. Very pleased.
I heard great reviews about this protective screen and I think i just got a bad screen.
Looks pretty good so far (2 months) and I can see it's value to protect the phone screen. The store installed it and I get free replacements if it comes off. How can you lose on that?
This IPhone cover is just terrible. I've gone through three IPhones so this was the third time buying a cover and it was the most difficult to put on by far! I tried to make an adjustment to put the cover in place and basically ruined it. $30 down the drain. I would highly recommend consumers to look elsewhere for their cover.
Looked like it would be great since screen was glasslike. It was also easy to install (not sticky). Looked great for a couple of days... Now it's full of dents and I will need to replace.
I have used these Zagg protectors one every device that has a screen on it sense they started making them. This is the first time I've been disappointed. The clarity is Awsome on this HD version! For some reason, they made it just a little bit too small this time though. Mine keeps coming up around the edges with the cover I have.
I have had many phones and all of them have had screen protectors on them. This one is a waste of money, had bubbles days later and when I removed it to reapply it became hazy.
I swear by Zagg. I have it on my tablet, kindle and my iPhone 4s. All of my products look like I just pulled them out of the package for the first time. This is by far the best screen protector out there. If you get it pay the extra $8 to have it installed. you wont regret it.
It does help protect your screen but it also gets dirty, and scratched up and you have to pay $4 shipping to get a replacement. I know you can ship this thing for 50 cents. So that is a rip-off to me.
Very durable works great with the phone I'll save you money
I would not reccomend this product. It does a good job at protecting your phone. It makes the phone looks really dirty, especially if you have a white Iphone. It looks really scratched and feels funny when touched.
This is a case friendly zagg so you don't have to worry about the edges getting torn up. If it is installed properly you literally cannot tell it's on your phone. If you're unsure how to install or don't want the mobile associates to do it just watch a youtube video it's not too hard. It's much better than the smudge proof zagg because it doesn't take away from the amazing display on the iPhone. It seems to last longer and look better than the standard zagg. With the lifetime warranty you can't go wrong for the price.
This was put in by somebody that worked at Best Buy. There is a few small bubbles. But they are not that bad. You can barely tell that they are there.
Seems like a nice product. Nice clear picture but a couple of weeks after I had my phone the Zagg was starting show signs of wrinkles that appeared, so maybe in wasn't applied properly.
This screen protector is great!! It is the case friendly version just like the box said and protects from all sorts of scratches. The only downside I have found is that BB charges $10 too much. For $5 more of what I paid in the store, I could have gone to zagg.com and purchased the HD Maximum Coverage screen protector which completely covers the front, the back, and all the sides. Too bad BB doesn't carry this.
the film is sticking pretty good to the 4s phone. the only draw back is with the Olloclip lenses. The lens does attach over the film without tearing it off. It leaves an indentation in the film but it disappears by the end of the day. This film was recommended by the Best Buy mobile tech and she put it on. I knew nothing about them as this is my first smartphone. It was a pretty good choice though, I'm happy with it.
THIS SHIELD IS AMAZING ITS LIKE A SOFT GEL NOT A HARD PLASTIC SO IF ANYTHING HITS THE PHONE IT WILL GIVE AND NOT TEAR OR SCRATCH AND YOU CANT EVEN TELL ITS ON THE PHONE ITS ALWAYS CLEAR
I had the Best Buy employee install the shield (really, the $8 is worth it!) and it fits perfectly with no bubbles at all. It seems fairly tough and resistant, but I could see how the edges, by not covering the entire face of the phone, might be able to peel up with use; it has not so far. Overall, I would recommend this product, though the price is a little high.
When I first applied this shield, I almost thought I ruined my phone! You have to follow the instructions carefully & spray the sticky side with the little bottle of solution they give you, then apply it -It had all kinds of hazey patches & bubbles, but the directions said they would work out in a day, and they did. The finished product is beautiful -VERY GLOSSY - VERY CLEAR- no haze whatsoever!
I could kick myself for letting the Best Buy sales guy talk me into buying this very expensive ($30) piece of garbage! He went on and on about how great this HD screen shield was! When I got it home, I cleaned the counter, washed my hands & made sure that the iphone screen was 100% clean & without a spec of dust. I then spritzed the screen and started to apply the film per the instructions. I was able to line it up pretty well right off the bat. I used the squeegee to get the excess water out but there were still little air bubbles that would not budge! The shield started looking more & more splotchy as the day went on. I finally took it back to Best Buy but they would not accept the return because I had used it! I was also told that if I would have paid the additional $8 to have it "INSTALLED", they would have taken it back! Poor product & poor customer service from Best Buy --- certainly not anything I've ever experienced in all the years I've been shopping at BB!
I knew from previous mobile phones that the devices are prone to nicks and scratches from day to day use. Because the iPhone uses a touch screen, it will get smudged and dirty. The ZAGG invisible shield enables me to keep my iPhone looking new and the screen crystal clear. It took a steady hand to install it, but with a bit of patience it can be done by just about anyone.
I guess it does the job of protecting the screen but it is not seamless, I was hoping I could not even notice that it was there, but it is noticeable.
Overall a great product. Not too happy with the price, but it definitely has protected my screen quite a lot - since I usually have my phone in my pocket - sometimes with my keys in it.
I have always used Zagg screens for my iphones, ipads and itouches - until now. I always loved how they went all the way to the edge of the screen - never a snag, nothing. Now they have changed to the "case friendly" design - which i am sad to say, after $30, lasted all of two months (not destroyed but wont stay on the phone anymore). Since it is not going to the edges, it gets caught - on everything - from my fingernail, to something in my purse, to the edge of the darn mophie juice pack - it was a mess - once it was even stuck to my face LOL. I will NOT spend the money anymore on ZAGG as this was a true waste for a product that i depended on. They have also stopped putting "anti glare/anti smudge" on the product packaging - now, does this mean that they dont do that anymore or are we supposed to assume that yes it does protect from this, we just dont need to mention it anymore? and WTH is with the "HD" screen?? seriously? LOL
For the high price I expected a flawless protector. That's not hat I got. The surface of the protector looks like someone used an object and attempted to mar the surface. Next time I'll try a cheaper brand which by my experience are just as effective as Zagg. Plus they are easier to install.
I purchased the 4s " new" cover. It doesn't cover the whole screen and the edges want to peel off. I'm not happy with this product. I've already purchased 3 sets in the past. And if you try to do the " free" replacement you have to send in your old " damaged " protector. It doesn't cover the peeling. For the price I am not at all satisfied. It does protect from scratches , but it peels off to easily. Especially in the corners. Btw I am an engineer and I do know how to properly put the "shield" on.
The Zagg cover is a nice product. Easy to install and does the job. My only complaint is the price. Quite high for what you actually are buying.
Even tho it's not expensive, it's still not worth it - according to the Apple experts. He told me that the face is so hard, if you were to scratch the face, you would break it.
Not a HUGE fan of this, but then again I don't like most screen protectors!!
I dont like to give bad reviews for things, but this one needs to be known! We purchased this at the Bestbuy store for $25,99 Then it cost $14.99 to have it installed totaling $40.98 we were told that this was the best shield in the store for the i phone. Its junk! its soft and you can snag it with your fingernail and leave permanent marks and scratches in it. it is only a few weeks old and is all scratched up and marked to heck. Dont know what happened to the military grade stuff, but this is not it , by far. its not on the phone anymore.
Great product can't even tell it's on there. Best Buy salesperson installed it and it looks good, no bubbles, no hint of anything on the screen at all.
This screen protector is made of elastic, glass-cling material. As such: 1) Installation requires surgically clean utensils, as the adhesive will not stick to the face of your iPhone wherever it has contacted a non-sterile object. 2) The adhesive must also contain the substance that law-enforcement uses to lift fingerprints. If, for even a moment, you touch the back of this product with your fingers, you will have immortalized your fingerprint like an insect in amber. 3) There will be bubbles. Period. Your only recourse is to peel the material back and try again; during this process, you're extremely likely to enjoy points 1 and/or 2 above. 4) The material is only "glass-like" (as per the manufacturer's description) if we're talking about glass panes produced in the sixteenth century - filled with bubbles and about as smooth as denim.
I thought it was easy to install, I am not super picky as long as it protects my phone I a happy do not notice any little bubbles, finger prints, or weird colors.
Perfect protection for the screen and doesn't distort the view
I had the ZAGG Invisible Shield HD installed by Best Buy which to me was worth the $7.99. He had it done in just a few minutes. The Shield HD is amazing!!!!!!! It's very clear and still pretty slick feeling. I feel it is less tacky feeling than the original Invisible Shield. It is hard to tell the Shield HD is even on the phone. I would highly recommend this shield. If you want to maintain the crystal clear look of the graphics of the iPhone but yet protect the screen, this is an excellent product!!!!
I had my phone for a year with no case and everyone kept telling me to get one. So I purchased the case and within one week, a piece cracked and broke off from the side, and within two weeks, I dropped it for the first time and the entire back of my phone shattered. The case was fine. I ended up losing $250 in credit when I went to upgrade the phone. Buy the wrap around rubber type, it's worth the extra money.
Superior better battery life than my last droid. Boot up superior fast does not lock up.
Best phone I've ever had (but that's not saying too much, since I've had mostly pretty bad phones and even the good ones weren't as good as this one: iPhone 4s)
Lousy quality audio just like the rest of the iPhones. Would like to be able to remove unused icons on Home screen.
Finally 1 device, after toting a phone an iPod and a planner for a few years I finally have one device. 5,700 songs, my e-mail, 4 calendars, and to do lists all in one.
Switched from Android to iPhone - - love the decision.
The iPhone 4s is definitely worth the investment for those coming into the Apple fold or for those who may still have the iPhone 3. Any iPhone 4 user would be better of waiting for the next iPhone as the features are not that much of an upgrade. Siri is a funny and useful new feature - however her propinquity to her network is her greatest downfall. Siri not only seems to required a network signal, but a very strong one. Also often she has a hard time understanding what was said, which can lead to some very colorful exchanges between the operator and her. Kudos to Apple for all the humor that was embedded within this little gem. Siri is overall a great new feature and with some polish, she will become and industry standard.
Something is wrong with OS5, before you purchase, take a look at apple.com and look at the 499 pages of people complaining. Will they every have an update for the OS5.0.1 that fixes the battery issue?
Overall the phone is great only down fall is it is only 3G would be best phone ever if 4g
Switched from HTC 4G Evo to Sprint iphone 4s when they came out. Don't get me wrong, the HTC Evo is a great phone and I can't say enough good things about it, however, the iphone 4s has edged it out in my book because of Siri and the icloud concept. While the Evo has 4G, I haven't noticed that the 4s being any slower. I do hope Apple and Adobe flash come to an agreement soon, as the Evo works with Adobe flash and it's videos and the Apple 4s does not. While the screen is smaller than the Evo, it is crystal clear and the camera function works well. Speaking of screens, make sure you get an Otter Box because the Apple 4s screen is pure glass. I'm extremely pleased with the 4s!
This is really great iphone. I am really like it. Thanks to Apple Inc.
what My Review Hove The Phone. i Just Love The Phone its A Beautiful Thing Since Apple Make This
I love my new shell case for my IPhone 4! I had gotten several compliments!
This case is a perfect fit. It doesn't add bulk to the phone yet covers the back and sides completely. I soft texture of the case really makes it easy to carry.
I love this cover. It is a tight fit on the phone and feels very good on the hands.
I've only had this 24 hours, but it fits my needs and improves upon the apple iphone bumper...mainly (1# a thin bumper that doesn't feel bulky in my front jeans pockets and slides in and out easily #old iphone bumper was sticky# #2# a larger port hole in the bottom that fits my car connector cable #hole in old iphone bumper was too small for 3rd party connectors# #3# clear cover on the back still shows my iphone skin #I wanted a bumper that fit 1 & 2 above and this case was as close as I could find# Only possible negative is that the rubber at the bottom around the docking port hole is a bit thin and it feels like it may rip in the future...hence the 4 stars instead of 5. But for the combination of price #1/2 of otterbox), larger port holes, slim fit, and clear back, I'm very happy.
I like the edging that muffles sound when you lay the phone down, keeps the phone anchored in place on hard surfaces, and cushions the phone from shocks.
I love this case! Great price! I like how it feels and how easy it was to put on my phone. I had dropped the iphone 4 many times and my son helped a time or two-- it seemed to give great protection being that my phone didn't break at all. It didn't make my phone feel bulky. It fit nicely-- no problems with any the buttons or charging port. I would buy this again! I had 4 of my friends also buy this case! I do wish it came in more colors.
Case only has rubber covering the corners.... Case doesn't protect the screen what so ever
In purchasing this case you still need to purchase a screen protector. Since purchasing this case <45 days ago I have thrown it away and purchased the Otterbox Defender, loved it so much we got our son one too,
I had this case on my iPhone 4 for about a year and a half, and it did an excellent job protecting my phone. And I am NOT very gently with my phone (drop it occasionally, leave it everywhere, shove it in bags, etc.). It fits and slides into my pockets relatively easily (coat, pants, bags) and protects very well. I liked it so much that I searched until I found it again for my 4S (lost my last one) - thanks for carrying it, Best Buy. This case is the pefect balance of protection and slim/minimal design. If you want slim and not much protection, go with no case or a slim hardcase. Or if you like massive protection, then go with one that looks like it's made from off-road tires. But if you want the best of both, this case is great.
excellent case, it protects my iPhone perfectly, it's durable and best of all it don't stick to clothing like other rubber cases do, making it very easy to get in and out of my coat and pant pockets.
its overpriced and poorly crafted. the plastic is floppy around the bottom and top edges, it feels like its about to rip.
There is nothing really wrong with this case. It is attractive enough and does not cover the back of the phone except with clear plastic; therefore, the Apple logo is visible. The cover can be easily removed and put back on. My real complaint about this case is that it does not provide sufficient protection in the event the phone is dropped. I actually kept this case for about a month and subsequently replaced it with an Otter Commuter case which provides more protection.
I bought this cover for my brand new iPhone 4S and found that it made the phone feel bulky and awkward to hold.
This case is very flimsy. I would not recommend buying one.
I ordered this online based on its looks. But when it arrived it turned out that the plastic was very slippery and the bevel of the surface and the clear circles creates an uneven surface that is very impractical. It slides off of all but the perfectly flat surfaces. And even when on a flat surface, you can't use the phone as it tilts. I'm returning it.
It's great if you want Otter Box like protection and extra battery life. I just removed the speaker covers, like one of the users recommended and it solved the problems of the echo and flash reflection. In my opinion it's expensive, for having to take off covers to keep it from interfering with phone performance. But, it's shock proof, I dropped mine on the pavement by accident and the case and my phone were unscathed. The battery is great also, I kept my bluetooth and wifi on all day and part of the evening, and didn't have to plug-in once. It was expensive, but I got what I was looking for, after I removed the speaker and camera covers, and I don't think taking the covers off really sacrifices all that much protection (it's not advertised to be water proof, just splash and rain resistant), just don't squirt water directly into the speakers and you're good, and it doesn't effect the appearance of the case in my opinion.
Due to all the negative reviews for this case, I opted to purchase it from BestBuy instead of mophie.com. Results: Pros: Durable, shock absorbing, somewhat weather proof. Cons: -Effectively nullifies the use of playing music out of phone speakers. The max volume is essentially lowered by 50% due to the full encasement of your device. -Camera Flash Incompatibility: Back plastic covering of camera port captures flash reflection and destroys any image you are attempting to take. (Must have flash disabled or reflection turns half the picture white) -Front screen is extremely thin and easily picks up scuffs & scratches. -Port cover flaps are thin rubber and require extreme caution not to over bend, stretch, or snag and rip off. (Eventually with time, the rubber will dry out and these will simply crack off) -Overheating: For a case designed for rugged outdoor use, it raises the temperature of the iPhone to an unusable threshold when in direct sunlight as the case acts as an oven. -If you have a zagg screen on your phone the integrated screen cover will stick to it and cause air pockets where it adheres to the zagg and skews your visibility, I would assume this is the case for other covers as well. I used their provided screen cover as well and the same issue occurs. In the end I simply removed it. -Echo Issues: The person on the other end of your phone call will receive echo feedback from the sound reverberations through your case and reflect back their own voice as well as yours. Due to all the negative flaws in the design of this case, I have returned this to my Best Buy within 3 days of testing. If Mophie manages to fix the echo, flash reflection, over-heating, replace the "integrated" plastic screen film with gorilla glass or a sturdy scratch proof cover then this may be more of a contender against a lifeproof case. I've decided to stick with my JuicePack Plus for the time being and hope that these issues can be ironed out. I was looking forward to having the best of both worlds having 2500mAH and weatherproofing but this case would not be the one that does it. Stick with either the Juicepack Air or Plus if you're looking for doubling your battery life in the day. Proud owner of 4 other juice pack airs/plus over the years but this one is the first Mophie case that I am extremely disappointed in. For a $139 price point with taxes, I would suggest buying one in a local best buy to test it out for yourself so you don't need to deal with the RMA and hassle of dealing with mophie directly.
I just purchased this case and I must say it protects your iPhone much like the Otterbox defender series. I've been waiting for a case that protects and increases battery life. Before this case you had to pick one or the other. The only slight problem I see is that users will experience an echo for their callers while in the case. However, this is an easy fix, just remove the small covers for the speaker / microphone on the bottom and the one near the earpiece. You will also have to remove the clear cover for the camera as the flash reflects back. The company made this to be water resistant but i dont take a bath with my phone so it didnot matter to me to remove the above mentioned items Other than those small issues I think all users will enjoy.
Great case overall, with a couple of exceptions. The case is a beast I must say. But a couple of things that make it not worth the $130. The sound is muffled and the volume is reduced somewhat. The echo is also there, noticeable on the other callers end. Also, the included screen cover watermarks instantly once it hits the phone. I have an otterbox and have owned the survivor and neither of those cases do this. Great overall idea if the kinks can be worked out.
Overall product is a good idea. Pricey so I expected it to hold up rather well, but just after a few days, my charging port on the bottom right corner started to move and is not able to keep a charge unless the phone is sitting in a certain position. Also the last battery cell is not charging and it maybe a defect, I have contacted mophie, but no response as of yet. Will update when I get a resolution. Other than that, just be weary and careful with the charging port, other than this, the product is very useful when the phone is about dead and you need some juice.
I love the fact that I can go all day with my phone without plugging it in. Also, because I work outside, it protects it. But this thing is big and weighs too much. I also had to ship my first unit back because of a bad echo on the other end of my phone call. They did replace it free of charge without a problem. all shipping was paid. I suggest getting the plus. much more compact.
It is a great Case/Battery for the IPhone 4S. I would recommend to anyone looking to double or triple the battery life of the Iphone. Protects if dropped. and some serious splash protection.
I would have given it 5 stars but the flaw with the echo. There is a real easy fix for it. All you have to do is remove the 2 little black speaker covers at the bottom of the case. This was never a waterproof phone so its not bothering anything. After that, the echo is gone. I knew about the issue before I bought the case, but I simply had to have it. Called Mophie and they are sending out kits to everyone who purchased this case within the next few weeks that will fix the problem for everyone. The extra battery is amazin. I am always on my phone so I need the boost. Doesn't affect phone signal or sound. This phone case is worth every penny.
If you can deal with the extra weight an bulkiness then its a great case. Anyone who works outdoors construction, landscaping stuff like that it would be well worth it. This case is durable! The built in charger will keep your battery going for days. But for carrying all day it's just to big and heavy. It actually was pulling my pants down when I had it in the belt clip at work. Returned it next day and went back to the good ol otter box. Much cheaper and half as bulky.
I work for an EMS company. This cover is great because I do not have to worry about the battery life, but that is where the good stops. The screen got a scratch while I was putting it on the phone. The sound is ok on both ends. I found out that when I tried to take a photo with flash, the flash would bounce back on the left side back to the camera. This renders the use of camera with a flash useless.
No doubt about it the juice pack pro has it's drawbacks. It makes your phone big and bulky but if you are going to do something where you plan on using your phone and cannot charge it this is a good thing to have. Once your battery gets to low battery status you simply turn the switch from red to green and it fully charges your phone. Great for people who uses their phone for active sports such as biking, hiking, anything where you use a map app that drains the battery quickly. I haven't had a problem with the echo like others have, have not had to remove any part of the case in order to make it work better. The bottom line is you need to know what you're looking for before you buy this case. It's not for everybody but it is incredibly functional if you need a much longer battery life. If you can put up with a bigger, heavier phone in order to have a longer battery life then this case is a good option. If not buy the Lifeproof or wait til another option comes along.
This is a great product except for the fact that the screen covering scratches with normal use. It has no durability whatsoever. I returned the product for that reason
Overall not a bad concept. But I would recommend the next level down which you can buy a belt clip for. I gave that one to my girlfriend and bought the bigger one. Wished I didn't.
i almost past one month since i bouth it and the click of the case is failling! it si have warranty? for how long??
I bought this phone because I had a Mophie Juice Pack + which stopped charging my phone. When I exchanged it I decided to go big or go home. I should've just gone home. This thing is huge, it's turned my smart phone into a massive growth on my hip. Thankfully it's a shock resistant case because I hit it on just about everything I walk past. The battery life is ok, I don't really see a huge improvement over the 2000 mAh case. I like being able to charge my phone without having to find a cord as I am a pilot and I work full time as well as being a single pilot. There are days where I simply am not near any sort of charging device. My main complaint is that lately, as soon as I unplug my phone from it's nightly charging session my phone drops to 98%. Now, I believe I'm sort of defeating the purpose if I start off less than 100%. A secondary complaint is the sheer bulk and clunkiness of the design. It's nearly impossible to keep in a pocket, so if you don't have the clip on your side, you must hand carry it everywhere.
The corners wear (after a week) and turn white (the case is black, but not all the way through)
The white part catches denim dye very easily. I like my phone in my back pocket, so blue is now a part of the color scheme. The earbud hookup hole on top is not big enough to fit my auxiliary cord. I have to take the case off to listen to music in my car.
The Otterbox protects my iPhone from damage. I like that it comes with a screen protector as well.
fits perfect around the phone and protects well, although would have like to have something cover the face of the phone.
This case does the trick and balances protection with a slimmed down profile.
The protection with a combination of soft rubber and hard plastic is the best balance for a protective case that stays trim and attractive.
The Commuter is a great case for anyone needing a more slimline case for their iPhone instead of the more bulky Defender. I also got the Zagg screen protector to help with the areas not covered by this case. My only complaint is that I wish I had chosen a different color. Mine is pink plastic with white silicone. The silicone has a tendancy to discolor. After only a week of use it was already showing usage. Other than my not thinking ahead, there is really nothing bad I can say about this case. I love pink and when the salesguy brought out the multitude of accessories I went straight to this case and not the black one for obvious reasons.
This otter box has already saved my iphone many times. Have had the phone drop from waist high distance and NO problems with the phone.
My wife uses her phone constantly, after the first few days of use. The white rubber part of the phone started to get dark. When I first saw this, I regretted buying this, because I should of know this would happen with this white material. My wife tried to clean it to get it back to looking clean. Unfortunately, that was not possible. You think the company would do a better job of testing these cases and work on the caveats, especially after spending $40 on a case. To say I am disappointed is an understatement
This is a great add-on for iphones used by kids, provides good protection from being dropped.
This case is a little hard to get on the phone at first but once it is on it is not going anywhere. I feel like my phone is safe I am every happy with this case
There are others on the market that fit better, but this is a good one
The case is a very slim and lightweight addition to the phone that does not get in the way of anything, except during charging. The Cut out for the Car Charger to connect is not big enough, so it frequently disconnects, but if you flip off that end, it is fine. An Annoyance, not a biggie.
Bought the case for my 15 year old son and he is very particular, Kudos to the manufacturer, My son loves it. The case itself is light but strong, looks awesome too
I got this because it was on special when I bought my phone. I like the texture and that it is not bulky at all. I also like the non-slip feel of it. This was the most basic color I could find at the Best Buy store I was at. The other options were few and not my style. But I am pretty gentle with my phones and so I went to Amazon and got a pretty case more my style. And also, not black so my phone now stands out more on a table full of smartphones. I like the case and still have it. I am sure I will switch back when the new one gets beat up.
Great design and lots of grip. It offers better than average protection for the price. Case pricing can be absurd nowadays. I am very rough with it and I have had no problems with the phone being damaged. It feels really good too. Easy to get on and off fast. Mine is starting to flex a little at the top and bottom because I remove it constantly (I only use it when I do outdoor activities).
Unable to charge phone well with this case on, and I barely use it because of this. I also don't believe it provides Icy protection. Like the look of it-
Great product. This case fits nice and snug around the iPhone 4S. It was easily installed and provides a fantastic look and feel to the iPhone. Every port is exposed for access. I am able to charge the device without having to take off the case. The only issue I have is that with the case on the sleep/power button is not as easy to push as I would like. I was actually expecting a silicone type material and discovered it is a harder material, which I think provides a little more protection. The holes provide a great grip on the device. The device slides easily in and out of my pocket. Highly recommend if you are looking for a slim case and moderate protection for your iPhone.
Purchase this because the iphone is very slick. This keeps it from sliding around in a vechicle or on a table top or desk. Also provides a good grip when you're holding it.
I've used this on 2 long runs and many short ones, so far it works great. The only drawback is the plastic screen. it makes it hard to see and it is not real touch sensitive.
Might work well for some but not so great for me. Doesn't fit if you have bigger arms
I am a road cyclist and love this arm band for my I Phone. It adjusts to anyone's arm size and keeps my phone in place while I ride. This allows me to listen to music on my rides which is so helpful and much needed on long rides!
Poorly made paid way too much this should be priced at $9.95 to match how badly it's made. Ugly looking and not good for larger arms. Total waste of money!
I hate having to remove my iPhone from its OtterBox to use this. The plastic is not tight enough, so I am unable to use the touchscreen to access my workout apps. I wish I had not wasted my money on this.
Do not bother wasting your money on this item. The armband is either too loose or too tight. It was slipping off of my arm during my entire work out. The screen protector feels like cheap plastic that isn't tight to the screen. In other words, when you try to swipe on your phone, you can't because the plastic is too loose to do so. I can't even begin to tell you how disappointed with this purchase I am. I will be returning the item tomorrow.
The neoprene material makes my arm really hot when exercising. Fastening buckle is more challenging than the Belkin FastFit. Got that model when I returned this one.
In order to place your iPhone in the armband, you must first take it out of the other protective case you may have the device in, then slide it into the armband. It is a pain to constantly swap from one form or protection to the other. After doing this for a week, both protective covers are now loose. I would like to find a case that snaps on to an armband. I had one like this for my previous iPods, and never had any issues.
Overall a good case but the film for front of phone didn't fit. Had to get ghost armor for screen
I recently purchased this case and have found it to be fine until I noticed one huge flaw. I'll start with the positive. Case looks good, has a great feel, and seems well built. The red/black combo really looks quite nice, better than a solid red case IMO. The soft touch finish feels great in hand. I was in love with this case till I used my iPhone to take a photo while in the case. If you do this and use the flash, your picture will have a red tinge due to the case being too close to the flash and light bouncing off the case when the flash goes off. It is a serious problem for me and I am going to see if I can return my case. I have included two photos taken seconds apart (long enough for me to remove the case) so you can see the drastic impact this case has on photo quality when the flash is used. These photos were only 30 seconds apart and the only thing I changed was removing the case.
Been through quite a few iPhone 4s cases and never found one as good as this for overall protection and comparability with a holster clip. The case itself is the best one I've had yet, offering double protection with the soft gel case that's bolstered with a snap on harder plastic shell that grips and protects the corners very well. It's a really durable case and looks likely to be solid for a long time to come which is where all the others I've owned failed. Best of all it comes with a great clip in belt holster. Had many belt holsters to date, none of which lasted more than 3 months but this is one is again solid and durable and shows no sign of wear/ tear after 3months. Very easy to clip phone in and out, appears well made, and is by far the best case and holster combo I've found yet for the iPhone. I'm using it daily for business and would highly recommend.
If you're looking for a rugged case to carry your iPhone while you're working this probably won't be sufficient. I work on a ranch and this just didn't keep the dust and dirt away from the phone.
worked pretty good although I returned it. I decided I needed a leather case with a cover for the front of the phone as well. As for these kind of clip cases I was very happy with it. You can clip the phone in either front or rear facing. The phones feels very secure when clipped in the bracket. BTW.. I'm finding some leather cases online but you have to order them from China or Hong Kong. It takes a little while but they do eventually arrive. Why these are not available locally I don't understand. Very good quality. Look up HOCO.
it's okay but kinda thick and "spongy" feeling it gets little "nicks" on it
Glad I have this, will protect my screen, and is guaranteed for life.
Had the guy in Best Buy put this on the new iPhone 4 I bought for my daughter (he seemed like he knew what he was doing). He messed up the first one so badly he had to go get a 2nd one off the shelf (thankfully I was not charged for the 2nd one). After he spent at least 15 minutes with the liquid and the squeegee included in the package, it was "okay" but not perfect. Now a month or so later the thing is starting to come off on both the top and bottom. The application process is so complicated, if a guy who does them all the time can't get it right, then I give up!
I got this shield when I bought my I phone. I've had 3 or so replacements from Zagg at 4 bucks a pop and I've never had one last more than a couple weeks with out getting a scratch/snag in the middle of the screen somewhere. I''m very careful and it still happens. Over priced junk. I would give it less than 1 star if I could because of the price. If it was a dollar a cover it would be a good deal, but not 20 bucks new and 4 dollars for a replacement. Love them till they scratch and then it's all I can look at. If you carry your phone in your pocket like I do. In a week or two it will get dinged up. I'm going out to find a better shield this week... Had enough with Zagg.
I would recommend this for everyone. Although it is a bit more expensive, I have not had to replace it. The cheaper ones last about 2 months. I have used this product my previous phone and my current phone and have not changed either.
I bought this with my phone and was told they would replace it for life if they put it on there and I went for it. Later (6 weeks) it started peeling off and I returned to the store and was told I had to go to a Zagg store over 4 miles away inside a shopping center to get replacements. No one told me about another store doing the warranty and I have trusted Best Buy in the past but a lot of that is gone now. Beware
This invisibleSHIELD was put on my new iphone at the time I bought the phone. It helps protect the glass screen and protects from fingerprints.
Expensive, but lifetime warranty if professionally installed. You have to register it, but that was easy.
THE SMUDGE PROOF ONE IS 100% BETTER, THE PICTURE IS CLEARER ON THIS ONE, BUT SHOWS ALL SMUDGES.
Perfect screen protector so I won't scratch my iPhone. Something you'll need if getting an iPhone.
This screen protector is definitely worth the buy. It works great when my phone is taking a beating at work. No scratches or dings at all.
Overpriced piece of garbage. This does not fit the iPhone 4s properly. It is clearly too small, so does not go to the edge of the phone. It leaves about a 2mm wide gap around the whole phone that is not protected. It installs ok, but the non-glare surface ends up feeling wrinkly and does not allow your finger to glide smoothly across the surface of the glass. After having it on my phone for about 3 weeks, the edges started crinkling from the phone being put into the holster until one edge started lifting off on it's own. At that point I gave up and just removed the dang thing. I knew my daughter had a much nicer protector she purchased at the Apple store, so I went there and found out the brand, then purchased directly from the manufacturer a protector for the front and back of the phone for LESS than what this cost for just the front! POWER SUPPORT brand is the bomb!
Don't believe the hype! In this case, you do not get what you pay for (or maybe in some twisted way you do at this price). I have gone through two of these since September 2010. It DOES NOT stay bubble-free if you use a case or bumper and it will eventually begin to peel off. It loves to attract and keep dust and oils/grease from your fingers. My second time around I even bought what ZAGG called a "case safe" invisibleSHIELD. It was not "case safe" as it began to bubble and peel after just two days. Additionally, ZAGG did not honor their so-called "lifetime warranty" with my first invisibleSHIELD even though I registered my product. Spending $20+ on a screen protector is just plain nuts anyway. Get a multi-pack of cheap protectors and live with replacing them every now and then. Or, take care of your phone, don't scratch the screen and clean it every now and then while it is turned off with a little water and microfiber cloth.
Necessary to keep smudges to a minimum - - having little kids makes this a must buy.
I cannot live without a shield on my phone or ipad2. Zagg is the best in the business
The cover doesn't fit perfectly onto the screen and has a lot of space. Its overpriced but at least it gets the job done. Should be a better fit since it is made specifically for the iphone. Dust and other particles love to stick to the screen and gets dirty quickly.
Had my phone for a few months now...no bubbles, havent had to change it! super clean! will probably buy these the rest of my life!
I like the invisible shield - it's thick and protects the screen pretty well. Easy to clean and best thing about it is Zagg will replace it for free!
The first thing wrong with this item is that the spray that comes with the protective shield that you use to apply it to your phone was open and had completely leaked out inside the packaging. I had to use what I could pour out of the little pouch it was in and thought I had enough to go ahead and attach it. Once I got it on it stayed on pretty well for about a day or so, but it would easily peel up on the sides and air bubbles would constantly get underneath it. It didn't matter how many times I would try to push it back down...it started to look awful. This product is WAAAAAY too expensive for these kind of issues. I ripped it off and threw it away after a week.
The Zagg invisible shield for my iPhone is durable. It was easily applied and there has been no trouble using the screen since applying. However, there seems to be a line across the film that I have not been able to erase or buff out. This does lead to a visual deficit when using various programs. I liked it enough to purchase from same maker for the household iPod touch.
I bought this with my iPhone 4S and had the staff of the store install it expecting that they would do a good job. I had to go back a week later because the protector was coming away around the speaker due to improper installation. The re-installed and the new one bubbled up after a couple of days but the store staff was able to smooth the bubbles out. To this day, the protector continues to slide around on the surface of the phone causing me to have to push it back into place. This sliding around has caused unsightly separation around the home button and the microphone. The $15 dollar screen protector from the Apple Store for my iPhone 4 had none of these problems. Additionally, the material used is slightly spongy to the touch and often will catch a fingernail if I'm not careful with how I place my fingers. A lifetime warranty is no good if it doesn't last long enough to deal with the hassle of replacing it.
I like the screen shield. It is a little hard to clean to get the smudges off, but other than that, it does what it is supposed to do. They are a little hard to put on, I would recommend having someone at the store help you to put it on. I like that the screen is protected against scratches.
The screen protector causes a hazy look, like a 1960's television. The plastic in the material might be tough, but it makes the iPhone screen look like it is floating in water. They advertise that the screen will prevent smudge, I agree, But they never said it will cause a the display to look blur and hazy. Horrible! I would not recommend it. There is no point if a screen can be scratch proof if it spoils the looks of the phone.
Your better off with the disposable screen protector. Screen Protector was easy to put on but it was cut a little smaller than phone screen size. Save your money and buy the disposable protectors. The clear Disposables are much better and they are more transparent and more natural than this protector.
The Zagg shield goes on easily. There is time to adjust the shield before it sets. It fits perfect and is thin enough for touch but thick enough to protect.
It keeps the phone protected and looking amazing!!
By far the best screen protector I've ever bought. It's worth the price.
I thought this was pretty spend when he first showed it to me. But with the lifetime warranty and the fact that the warranty will cover any damage to the phone, I was sold. Everyone who sees it, wants one for their phone too. I have had my phone abut a month now and it is still on there perfect with no peeling or bumps or anything. There are no scratches to my phone or to the Shield. Definitely worth protecting your phone!
Was really doubting the claims of clearness and clarity, but I love my Zagg protectors. I have both the front and back version, and couldn't be more pleased. We bought the front ones for our kids' iPhones, and coupled with cases, we feel their devices are very well-protected now, without being too bulky or having some screen cover that interferes with the touchscreen. Love the Zagg!!
Screen is protected and it does not affect the functionality of the phone. I dropped my phone, as I have seen many of my friends do, my case completely shattered but my phone was not injured. I have seen my friends drop theirs and their screen broke with much less impact. Will never have another phone without this!
HAve been using zagg Shields for years now. Great protection and lifetime warranty. Wish the HD version would have came out sooner.
Not sure why all the negative reviews, other than install issues. If it is installed correctly, there is no better screen protection available. I bought 2 of these, one for my wife and one for myself. The sales person installed it for us and did an outstanding job. No wrinkles, bubbles, lint, or anything. Looks and fits perfect. Fingerprint proof, and grease resistant. Screen always looks clean. My only advice would be to pay the $ to have the Best Buy personnel install for you. If done correctly, this is an outstanding product. Getting one installed for my iPad as well.
This protective shield does what it is designed to do. It protects the iPhone screen from dirt and fingerprints very well. It is a lot more attractive than others I've seen, because it is more invisible and allows easier screen viewing in bright light.
Just had this installed on my White Iphone 4s for Verizon. Great Looking Product. Love the little Zagg Tag down in the lower Right hand corner. Have to wait 12 Hours to put my Speck Case back on my phone due to tightness of the case. No problem tho very happy with GeekSquad and their quickness. A++
Frayed quickly around the edges and then peeled right off and disappeared one day. CAn't even get the refund/warranty on it because it's lost. Totally not worth it. Buy the 3pack of screen protectors for $15 and replace them.
I drop my phone a lot and this screen protector works great. I put a big scratch in the film the other day and it buffed right out. Very easy to put on your phone if you follow the directions. Worth the $$.
Easy use in sun and home light. Fingers slide easily on face of phone.
This keeps your phone screen like new. I have one on my iPad as well. It is a little pricey, but it's the best I've found for my mobile screens!
I have had 2 of these, they come off and get dirty
you do loose a bit of the clarity of the picture but i dont wont my screen exposed.
Instructions to apply were clear and concise. Application was easy when following the instructions with no bubbles, streaks, or smudges. It is easy to clean. The touchscreen works as if the shield wasn't installed. There is no reduction in the clarity of the display. This cost a bit more than the cheapies at the discount store but application was easier.
In the adv these guys shows all junk videos like it will protect like any thing, its not true. I brought this product and got some scratches. Sale representative said, they will cover this product for life, but its not true. When I ask for the replacement after 6 months they are charging me 14.99+shipping and handling. When I try to call customer care, they kept me waiting for 5 min and nobody responded. I am really disappointed with this product, do not buy this one..
Had the manager of the cellular phone dept put the Zagg on my new iphone4s but it slid right off a couple of hours later. The are pricey too!
This are really nice for a lower end ear bud. We received them free for upgrading to the iPhone at Best Buy.
The screen shield is a good investment. It does keep the screen from getting scratched and a little easier to cleen.
The shield is probably great for protecting my phone, however, it stuck to another piece of plastic in my purse. When I tried to pull the two apart, the sheild buckled. I took it to an ATT store and they told me to take it back to the Best Buy where I had purchased it. I will do that in the near future.
This is a nifty little screen protector that is absolutely amazing! My other screen protectors got scratched easily. I drug my key across it and it didn't leave a scratch. Plus it has a lifetime warranty so if it does get messed up ZAGG will replace it for free! Yes, it can be a little tricky to install but of you follow the instructions it's fairly simple. My 5 year old sister had no problem putting one on her iPod.
worth every penny and easy to put on. just take your time. easier than the ipad
This product does exactly as advertised. It's well worth the investment for your iPhone.
The shield works great, no problems with it pulling up or anything.
Protects phone from scratches. However, you can see smears from fingers really easily and it has a sort of textured look to it if you look at it angled wise.
I purchased and paid to have a Zagg screen protector put on my iPhone at Best Buy. The person at Best Buy who put it on my phone didn't do it correctly. There were bubbles at the bottom of the screen and I was told they'd go away. They didn't go away, but they did get bigger. She kept the spray and cloth, even though I paid for it. She said I didn't need it. I would have been able to fix the bubble problem myself had she given me the spray and cloth. After this, I don't plan to get another Zagg. My screen protector looks really bad because it wasn't installed properly. Now I need to get a new screen protector but it won't be a Zagg!
I had too much pride when I purchased this to have Best Buy install it. Boy was I wrong. It was worth every penny. Not only did I completely ruin my first one, I didn't follow the directions as well as I should have. I'm a guy, sew me. :-) I then bought my second one, paid to have it applied, and now am very happy. The feel of it is great, and you can't even see it on the phone. Now that I have seen it applied, I know what I did wrong and what I would do if I got another one for a different device. Live and learn. Make sure you really wet both sides of the shield. Place it on the phone and move it around to the exact position, then squeegee it. I didn't wet it enough.
This product is awful. While putting it on my iphone it got dirty just from lying around when I was waiting for the solution to dry a little and I could not get the dirt off. Do not spend your money on it.
This screen protector is overpriced. Do not buy. The view On the screen is altered. It ultimately sucks. And your phone is better at risk with the $650 replacement fee.
Once you have it installed it works great. It stays clear and it doesn't get in your way
I got this about 2 weeks ago and it is already scratched! Now I need to see if their guaranteed replacement holds up. What a pain!!
The proximity sensor does not function properly when this protector is used on the white iPhone. When in call the screen does not go dark when placed against your face resulting in muting, speaker and dropped calls. Would not recommend.
First purchased for iPhone in November 2010. Easy to apply. There were small air bubbles on the screen, but disappeared as the instructions indicated. No issues with screen responsiveness. After approximately 5 months product edges began to loose adhesion. Used the warranty replacement offered by Zagg to get a new one for just the price of shipping. This time it lasted only 2 months, then lost adhesion. in both instances when I removed the product, even the parts that were still stuck to the device had turned a greyish or blueish tint. When I removed the first screen protector I noticed how cool (as in blue, not awesome) the screen looked and how much warmer it looked without the screen protector. After I applied the replacement, images were still clear and warm, but after about a month I noticed images looking a little cool. I believe it that this product will protect your screen from scratches, but I can't recommend. For me, it didn't last, and it affected screen quality. As a comparison, I used the Power Support screen protector on my iPhone 3G for 2 years without any trouble.
This product is a little tricky to apply, but... once it's on correctly it is virtually invisible and (mine at least) does not move. I can only tell that it's there because of the 1mm around the edge of my iPHone4 that it doesn't cover. I'm using it with a bumper case and carry it in my front pocket. I haven't tried carrying it with keys, but it is much tougher than the screen protector I'd used with my iPod Touch. I am not too gentle (dropped the phone many times!) and my 5 year-old likes to take photos/movies, but there is not a scratch on my phone. Also, the lifetime guarantee is great. Apple replaced my iPhone4 (home button) and Zagg sent me a new shield. I think I had to send back the old one. Now I'm getting one for my wife..
Horrible product not worth the money pain to install then dosent even do good job. Buy another protecter
Solid protection for IPhone--had to replace one for my IPad and Zagg sent me a new one free of charge. (Not defective, but installed incorrectly)
Read so many reviews about how great these screen protectors are... they are not.. They are not easy to install, but I installed it perfectly. it has an orange texture to it. you can clearly see that it is there, and since it doesn't go all the way to the edge, it collects dust around the edge.. it looks cheap, feels cheap, and takes away from the overall cool look of the phone.. Now they claim that screen protectors that go all the way to the edge are not compatible with bumper type cases... this is wrong... after a week of using this screen protector, I took it off and replaced it with one from Power Support USA and a Reveal Frame case from Griffin, and couldn't be happier!
Even after keeping my iPhone 4 in a case and protecting the front, the bottom of the Zagg stretches under the home button with normal everyday use. The Zagg also DOES NOT cover the whole front. There are edges around it that are not covered. Luckily I have yet to get scratches in those exposed areas because I am careful. Also, I noticed after having a Zagg installed on mine at Best Buy Mobile that my screen is LESS responsive. This is also the case on a Co-worker's Droid X. I'm shopping for other protectors. After 4 months a product that is shown to "withstand a tool taken to it" is proven to be a hoax.
They promised big and delivered small. Cover is really tough to install properly. Does not lay smoothly on the face of the phone; its got a texture. And after two weeks of careful use it has a stain in the most used part of the screen. No pass
covers my phone, but not easy to put on, and is quite expensive; but my friend saw mine and wants one!
I absolutely love Invisibleshield and completely stand by their products. I have had them on my three iPhones and have never once had a problem. It is literally impossible for me to mess up the screen. I highly highly recommend it. It is a little pricey but well worth the investment
When I told the sales lady at Best Buy that I needed a screen protector, she automatically grabbed this one. I was put-off by the price, but she convinced me to purchase it by saying it had a lifetime guarantee if I would register it online. I went home and immediately registered it, but found it difficult to choose my product on the Zagg website. Oh, well. This screen protector has been good to me. The Best Buy employee put it on for me, and she lined it up perfectly with the buttons. It hasn't folded up in the corners, and it remains with no bubbles on the screen. I've only had it for a month, and it's going to take a few more months until I actually feel like I got my money's worth, but....overall, I think I'd buy this product again.
The protector was put on by Best Buy for me & has worked really well so far.
This has been the best screen protector ive had thus far. I was one of those people that would buy the cheap ones in bulk off ebay and just replaced them when they got scratched. I finally broke down and bought an expensive one. The guy at best buy put it on free of charge and did it very well....straight, no bubbles, etc. I work out in the oil field where sand is everywhere. Even with that, i still have not seen any scratches. I highly recommend this.
Does what it's supposed to. I paid to have it installed which I'm glad I did. I have little patience for putting screen protectors on.
i thought that the ZAGG InvisibleSHIELD for Apple® iPhone® 4 - Clear was a horrible product so i returned to my local best buy
My kids are always using my iPhone. They get goop and grime all over my IPhone, but the shield works great, I just wipe all the mess and fingerprints right off and the screen doesn't have a scratch on it! I had the guys at Besy Buy put it on my phone (I think they will do it for free if you buy the Shield there) and you can hardly even notice that it's there. I don't think it's made the touch screen any harder to use by having the Shield, I am able to play games, text, etc just fine.
My wife wanted a screen protector for her new phone, one that would work with her case. I didn't like the price (more than 3X the other brand that was available), but now that she's been using it for several days and I see what a high quailty product it is, and how much my wife likes it, I'm glad she made this choice. Installation was pretty easy ... it installs a bit like privacy film on a window ... they provide a small spray bottle of lubricating fluid, which you use to wet both sides of the protector, position it, and then rub off the fluid to remove bubbles and secure the protector in place. The sales rep pointed out that some of the boxes (perhaps newer version?) stated on the package that they would work with a case, so we bought one of those ... the protector is sized slightly smaller than the screen, so that it works perfectly iwth the case that she bought (a Belkin Grip Vue). And it has a tactile feel that she likes much more than the bare screen. A really good purchase for your iPhone 4!
The screen protector works amazing, it absorbs any kind of scratch or drop. Nothing gets through to the phone unless you were to throw it into the ground.
I do like this screen protector. I have found that it does still shift (slide) when I carry it in my pocket. I usually have it in a holster but not always. I can always slide it back into place so not that big an issue. The biggest is that if the protector slides to far it will hang over the edge and get dust on the under side. I have not been able to clean all this dust off so now one edge will not lay flat. This is very noticeable and I have not come up with a good solution yet.
have used several, cheaper versions, quality on this is superior to anything else on the market. Price is a little high, but can not see having to replace anytime soon.
product material is great. It protects the phone while still keeping the sleek design. However, this isnt the easiest product to install if you want it to look great. The product goes on fine but you must be very careful to avoid getting bubbles, lint, or alignment just right. Just know going in that there will most likely be smudges or bubbles which distracts from the phone display
This shield was tricky when applying and not getting finger prints or bubbles. The bubbles did work out for the most part after three days- but they are not completely gone. The price is ridiculous for this little piece of plastic. I have a sony MP3 player which scratches easily so I needed a shield- this works, but way too expensive.
I purchased and had installed for a small fee at Best Buy while I waited, it only took a couple minutes. Great protection because I keep my phone in my purse with keys, etc. You will not believe how good it is! It does not affect my touch sensitivity at all. I have it on the front screen with a Rocketfish brand gel case on the back. Excellent product!
Shield was a challenge to apply to my iPad. I happily paid to have the Best Buy staff apply it. I had to take it back once to be applied again. Overall happy with its performance, but would have never gotten it on accurately by myself.
Its awful it costs way too much money to be broken after a few weeks.
Like a complete Gomer, I slammed my iPhone in my car door. With the back spider-webbed, I needed a case that would enclose the phone and allow me to continue to use it until the iPhone5 comes out (and I can upgrade). The hard plastic back is awesome because it allows me to get it out of my pocket WAY more easily than rubber cases. I also like that there are rubber pieces that protect the headphone jack and charging port. (minimizes pocket lint, dust and risk of water damage) My only issue is that I've had it about a month and the rubber is split near the mute button.
Just a few years ago, Otterbox made very good and durable cases. Recently, I have been through two of these cases. The first one lasted a grand total of about six months and then the plastic outer shell cracked and broke at the bottom where the plug is inserted (I am very easy on my stuff and work a desk job). So, I got another and that one lasted a grand total of about two months. I took that one off the phone to hand wash in cold water. When I put it back on the phone, I found that the plastic piece had warped and no longer fit snugly on the phone so it was snagging my pocket as I took it out. As I said before, Otterbox used to make great products, but now I think they are more concerned about quantity rather than quality.
Dropped my iphone from about 6ft into the concrete. The phone landed on the top left corner. Caused a nice dent on the hard plastic part of the case and absolutely nothing done to my phone.
I love this case. I've dropped my phone a few times and this case certainly saved the day on those few occasions. The look is definitely professional and sleek and I wouldn't pick another case!
I have two older teenage boys that I have purchased these for. They have proven to be less than durable. Maybe if you never use headphones with your phone, or never dock your phone they would last longer. Both of them have had two sets...was trying to give the product another chance. But will move on to something else now.
Good protection but the rubber cushion under the outer case shifts, taking it in and out of my pocket, and I have to remove the cover and reset it.
Returned twice. 1st one rubber protection got lose during the first 3 days. 2nd one case cracked after a week. Went with a different case. Not worth the price. Paying for the name brand.
Great case for the DROPPER in your family, some times you have that slippery hands family member, this is their case!
Overall, this a very durable case without being unnecessarily cumbersome. I would say that this case provides the "best of both worlds" satisfaction of protection without feeling like you're holding a brick. Well worth the money.
This is a good case that is not too bulky and protects the phone.
If you're looking for a case that really PROTECTS, this is definitely the case. It is bulky and thick, but it's not too bad. You get used to it, and I think the benefits definitely outweigh the alternative of breaking the phone, because I drop my phone A LOT. It works well, and the built in screen protector is nice because then you don't have to apply one, however after a while mine got a weird rainbow-ish bubble thing (that was only visible when the screen was off). It still works fine though, and if you're really worried about it i've heard of people punching out the screen protector and adding their own ZAGG. I will say that the bulkiness of the case does mess with the signal just a bit. My wifi/3g takes a tad longer to load and I don't always have full bars, even on the wifi in my house. Overall though, love the case and the color is great. I keep other cases too to switch between, but when I know i need protection this is the case for me. It is a little pricey, but I think it will last.
works great and lots of apps to help you wiht all your needs!!
iPhone 4 is a great product. I would recommend this phone. I would also highly recommend an OTTERBOX DEFENDER series case for this phone...has great protective case + optional belt clip. Because...if you drop an iPhone with no case on it...well, you will probably be buying a new iPhone. The screen can crack/shatter easily. So, DEFEND yours. :)
If you've been looking for that new phone, you've found it. With all the amazing features the iPhone 4 has to offer, it is by no doubt the most obsolete product on the market. Reasons being that you're able to download music and movies on the go while at the same time either writing an email, listening to music, taking pictures, texting a friend, playing one of thousands of games and these being only a few possibilities this phone is able to achieve. Now if you're worried about running out of battery before lunch, don't be. Because all the stories about low battery life are false! The Phone is good for an entire day's use, just charge it during the night and you will have a good charge throughout the day. This Phone is your multitask genius, the simplicity of everyday is now combined into a light weight easy to use Smartphone.
Non-Apple fan here, decided to take the leap from flip phones to smart phones, and thought I'd start here. BOY HOWDY is this thing awesome. So easy to use, I've never consulted any kind of owner manual, yet I am using this thing liberally. I watch Netflix movies on it, watch the NFL Ticket on it, play Fantasy Football, record my own songs using Garageband and peavey's $29 LINK kit, and so much more. Oh yeah, it works great as a phone too. It's friggin' awesome. THIS is Apple's best product.
Love it .. so far so good!! great product over all
This phone has excellent reception, which is more than can be said for my last phone. It has lots of features that I have yet to explore and learn about. The only reason I gave it 4 starts was because it is soo much different than any phone I have had before and there is a bit of a learning curve.
This phone is amazing and you would love it! Never been happier
I love my iPhone. I had been wanting one for a while and had to wait while my mom and sister were able to get one, but it was well worth it! I don't know how I lived without it. I'm totally addicted to having the internet and music and games at my fingertips at all times. It is, however, very breakable as I learned just 2 weeks after buying it! I would definitely recommend the Best Buy insurance plan. It took 4 days, but I had a phone back at no charge, except the monthly fee.
This is my first smartphone and I can honestly say I am very pleased.
so first off i really like this phone. It has many great features such as the screen resolution. The screen resolution i would have to say is pretty imrpressive comparing to alot of other smartphones. Another great feature is the app store. U can buy so many amazing apps such as Cod Zombies , it is $5 and so worth it cause almost like the xbox version :D. so overall has some really amazing apps(and yes there is MUCH more apps than just that) Also the battery life is good , not amzing but good. U can play games for about 3 hours straight non-stop without it completley running out of battery, u can listen to music (when on stand by mode) for like 1-2 days total ,u can also talk on the phone with ur friends for about 8 hours non-stop. So ya the battery is easily comparable to alot of other smartphones , but not every smartphone.Another feature is the 2 cameras. They are both pretty good quality and i was shocked by the front camera, i expected it to be bad , but it was like almost HD. Lastly i would like to talk about the internet speed. It is faster than my laptop (using wifi) when having 5 bars. Using the 3g mode it takes about 1-5 seconds to load a page depending how good of signal u have. So overall i really enjoy this phone very much. SO GET IT , ITS WORTH EVERY PENNY !!!!!
Save your money and get an Android smartphone instead. You'll spend half as much, get a better camera, and you won't be missing out on any "special" apps because of the elitist exclusivity of the iphone app market. Oh, and my favorite missing function on the iphone? No speech-to-text recognition software available. It seems like a minor thing, but after time with an Android phone, its like losing your wallet.
Easy to use, long battery life, so many free apps, no delay on touchscreen, and the itunes/ipod feature rocks! The best phone I have ever had by far. No other product on the market compares.
Love the camera, the way you can access facebook and upload photos easy!!!
iPhone is awesome. Very simple to use. Went from Droid X to this phone. I find it a much easier phone to use. Screen is awesome. Sound is great on it.....although the iPod part is not very loud when playing music. Battery life is pretty decent when not playing Angry Birds.
Basically I ws never told that all of my voicemails would be deleted by going to the iphone. Verizon Wireless claims they don't backup their production servers so they refuse to restore my voicemails. They do however blame Best Buy and Apple for the unfortunate situation.
Love the phone just wished the battery would stay charged longer!
Love my new iPhone 4G. Is so fast. I can do anything I need with it from personal to work related items... can access the internet faster than my laptop.... love it, love it, love it.... the best phone i have ever owned...
i upgraded from a HTC Droid incredible and got an Iphone 4 and i love it no mater what you hear its the best phone on the market today, buy it and don't hesitate!
I LOVE MY iPhone 4G!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It's the best phone I've ever had & I've had all types of cell phones & carriers. Verizon Wireless has the best coverage! I never had any dropped calls & I NEVER can seem to find a "dead zone" at least in MI that is! I highly recommend an iPhone for your next purchase! I'm never getting anything different!
I have never had a iphone until now. I was very very familliar with Apple though. What I like about the IPhone is that there is a very sleek design, the speed is like lighting, and the apps are unbelivable!
First, let me say that this is a great device. Not only is it a phone, but it's also an iPod, camera, game station, and pretty much whatever else you want it to be. However, I have some good and bad points about this phone. Bad: The price. Let's face it- you're paying for two things here: 1) The Apple logo and 2) Bragging rights. The battery life isn't the best, but compared to other smartphones, it's above average. Now for the good. The touch screen is amazing. The reception on the Verizon phone is great. The back and screen aren't easy to scratch. There are so many apps and things you can use this phone for; it's amazing! The camera isn't out-of-this-world, but it's way better than my last phone, so I'm considering that to be a plus. There's one last thing I want to mention. On the Verizon phone, you cannot do the "talk and data" thing. Basically, you can't be on the phone and order flowers for you wife because you forgot it's your anniversary (as seen on the TV commercial). Based on my experience, you CAN talk and use wifi at the same time! Since most places have some sort of wifi, I'm not seeing this to be that big of a deal. All in all, I don't think I could have been happier spending $200 elsewhere.
This is the best smartphone on the planet: period. I've been playing on a Droid for months now, and I'm happy I went with an iPhone. There really is no comparison. I'm not going to go into details about different features, because I don't feel like typing a thesis. Just know this is the best phone that money can buy, and you should buy it on Verizon's network.
I love this phone. The camera is great. Nice size. Like to watch netflix. Retina display to amazing.
this is the best phone ever put onto the market!! :[) not only is it the best phone its on verizons network!! best combination ever made. the only slight problem is the battery only last's one day if your on it. but other than that and a glitch here and there its amazing!!
There was so much hype about this phone and it has lived up to its name. I am an average phone user that thought it would be fun to step into smartphone land, and I love it! I have never had the need to use talk and data at the same time...I actually think that it is quite rude if you were doing this. I wasn't worried when reviewers started knocking down this phone for that reason. Battery life was horrible until I turned off the notifications in my settings. Now, my battery life skyrocketed! For me, and many people, you do not need 8 different apps pushing data to you 24-7. When I want to see a facebook message, I'll open my facebook applications and see it. When I want to check the score of the game, I'll open that app and check it out.
The iPhone4 is a good phone for some things. But, it has a problem with some phones dropping calls when held at certain angles. It also has A LOT less free apps than the Android system. Also, you can't remove the battery or plug on an extended battery either. For your money, I would get a Droid phone. I got one after having the iPhone and being disappointed and also reading negative consumer reports about the iPhone 4 just like my problems. The Droid gives you tons of free apps and is more customizable and my HTC Incredible has an extended battery with a case that fits it. But you're the consumer, so the decision is yours.
The features and apps available for Iphones are limitless, you just simply have to give in to Apple and purchase their product, as there is really no other competition.
I was number one in line and I was real happy to get this phone and I was thinking what to do first because I had an iPod and it worked great. So I love having all the options that it gives with all the very fast processing and it runs with no glitches and I have had it for a few weeks now. it's so useful. I wrote this review with the iPhone4 from verizon!!!
First off, buy it at Best Buy. I kicked myself in the butt for not doing it. iPhone 5 will be out this summer and with the Buy-Back-Program at BB (free at the time of writing) you can get the iPhone 4 or any other phone, now, and then when iPhone 5 comes out trade it in. Doesn't have anything to do with your carrie's upgrade time; it is independent. Review of iPhone 4: I love it!! I tried a Droid Incredible first, but I use Bluetooth/Handsfree a lot and the Voice Dialer preloaded is worthless. I hate LG, but I would take an LG over it any day. Looked into apps, couldn't find one that was decent and hate the droid market scheme. I began comparing the Samsung Facinate to the iPhone (having looked into the Facinate too). If you don't want an iPhone, but like it's layout go with the Facinate, it has the Droid feel mixed with iPhone interface. I ultimately ended up with the iPhone because I was secretly comparing all the other phones to iPhone. Mostly because of the App Store. The productivity Apps I wanted they already had and with good reviews. Yeah, Android will get it, but everything said "Coming Soon!" Why get something new, that you cannot fully use (at least in my case) and without a release date. I also began looking into phone security, these are just computers now with phone capabilities, and for the time iPhone/Apple appears to be safer. Android will tell you everything that a program will have access to, but if you don't want to have access, you just don't install it. Where Apple takes care of it all in the front end when a developer wants to produce an app. Of course, then you are relying on Apple not to screw up. The fact that Netflix will not go to Droid until they clean up their security issues because of their DRM for the movies was a huge flag for me. What I don't like about the iPhone: Proprietary (I knew this before hand), which makes everything more expensive. Lack of expandable Memory Lack of UI change/design. Android has the iPhone beat here. They just look cool! However, I did find out that just like regular cell phones, each manufacturer can use their own UI, so just because you buy an Android doesn't mean you will like the user interface; it changes per manufacturer. I liked the Samsung Facinate because it mimicked the iPhone. I hated the Incredibles' 6 different screens, however they too designed the phone to look like the iPhone 4, at least in initial appearance. Bluetooth functionality: It works great, when it works. The voice dialer works great. It is Apple's own and does a good job. Not as good anything by Nuance, but still better than the rest. I have found that it does not like to reconnect so easily. I use a BlueAnt speakerphone for my office and driving. If when I am driving and need to run into a store, I turn off my speakerphone, upon returning, the speakerphone will not reconnect to the phone. I have found, I must turn off Bluetooth manually on the phone, make sure the speakerphone is turned off, then turn on Bluetooth on the iPhone and then the speakerphone. This process works every time. The bluetooth functionality is very slow. I also do not like it is always in discoverable mode. With that being said everything else just works. I use a Windows PC in the office and sync through iTunes just fine. I had to forward my email accounts via Google and set up an IMAP solution. It works. I wish the MAIL app on the iPhone was better, but it is pretty much useless to me. Not much else to say, other than I love it. My only hesitation with jumping headlong into an iPhone was because Apple products don't always play nicely with Windows PC's. I've been down the Macbook rode before and on the business end, I don't care for it. Hope this helps. Everyone uses these for a different reason. Really if I didn't have to have a smartphone I wouldn't. It's something I put off for nearly 3 years. Having said that, I would recommend this phone to anyone.
Moved over to Verizon from my AT&T iPhone and while the dropped call issue is better (not perfect) I found out the hard way that I miss the voice and data running at the same time! I was on an hour long conference call and miss 2 critical emails while on the call. I also found that you cannot conference more than 2 people or have 2 conferences at the same time. Speed also lags to a big degree with the Verizon iPhone which makes a difference when pulling big files like Word or PowerPoint. Also, no international so I would need to rent again with Verizon when I go overseas. The Verizon iPhone may be a great phone for personal use but I found out that you should NOT use for business purposes! I will be switching back because I need the features that AT&T provide. I can put up with the occasional dropped call if it means not losing a half million dollar deal while on a conference call.
Lovin every minute of it!!!! This is a great way to stay fully connect via everything.
Just picked up the iphone 4 and a new verizon plan. No hassles setting up and the phone is so much easier to use than my Windows HTC phone. Chose iphone over android and Verizon over AT&T after heavy research. So far phone and plan are exceeding expectations. I had the ipod touch for a while and liked the navigation. Iphone, as you'd expect is quite similar. Windows and android were simply too much...of everything, for me. I lightly browse the web, facebook and manage emails from my phone mostly. This phone performs quickly and efficiently. It does lack an indicator light and a newer iphone is surely due to be realeased soon. Also the buttons on the side are slightly off from the at&t version. So case choices are limited so far. Overall, I recommend highly and I'm sure more tech savvy people can do 10 fold what I'm capable of at this point. I actually like using my phone again!
When I went to get my iphone at Bestbuy, no one knew it was even being sold at this location. I walked in and got my iphone 4 for me and my wife within 20 mins and I was out the door with 2 new phones. I was with AT&T <-&*()&)%^*&%&^*$%^!! Yes, thats how I felt when I was with them. I am just so glad with Verizon and was happy to see VZ got this. I had mine for 3 days.. I have not had one single drop call yet and got service with full bars where I didn't have before with A&TT ^&%$%^&$&$. I work as a pilot and I've traveled many many places and Verizon has service where AT&T wouldn't even get a single bar. I am speaking from experiences. If you have choice to choose. GET VERIZON iPhone. It's the BEST!!
Had AT&T iPhone 3g, changed carriers to Verizon and upgraded phone to iPhone 4. AT&T coverage and dropped calls was just unacceptable. Verizon is so much better in this regard. I was going to wait for the iPhone4- 4G, but after seeing the better reception and better screen graphics with the iPhone 4-3G I bought it and transferred my service and phone number to Verizon. Some negatives: 3G is not 4G, but Verizon's 3G is plenty fast.... for some reason faster than ATT's 3G service. Verizon's current iPhone 4 will not work in Europe or in most places outside the USA. Since 99% of my cell phone use is in the US, the fact that I'll need to rent a phone outside the US is bothersome, but not a deal breaker. My AT&T service was running about $85/month. Verizon service, bundled with two other cellular phones, is about $40/month. All in all, the phone is really quite good.
I got the iphone 16gb for verizon on the 7th and it is amazing. The display and touch is godly. The 720p video is terrific. Well worth $200
This is quite simply the best phone out there, very sold feel. Hold one, outside of all the security gear, you will agree. I absolutely feel this is the best phone overall avaliable to the mass-public. Buy with confidence!
I have been a Verizon customer for 7 years this is the best phone I have ever owned. I am a big fan of Apples, iTouch and iPad. And have been wanted the iPhone, thank you Apple and Verizon for bring us this phone. All the calls have been clear. Was able to load all apps, songs and audio books with out any problems. Down loaded the GPS app worked just as good as our stand alone device. The screen text is large enough for this nearly 60 year old to read.
Like others, I've been on Verizon for years, as they have far and away the best coverage in my area. I purchased the first Droid on release day, and use my Smart Phone on a daily basis. So, how does the iphone compare to the previous Android offerings on Verizon? I've had the iphone for 4 days now, and its very, very good. Not perfect, but overall a better smart phone experience than Android. Foremost, its an excellent phone. Voice quality is fantastic. The 1st gen Droid had terrible problems with echo on the receiving end. So bad, you had to cycle the speakerphone to eliminate the echo. iphone is crisp, clear, and hasn't dropped a call yet. Bluetooth sync with my car was instant and painless. The iphone virtual keyboard in phone mode comes up quickly, and works everytime. Beyond its base phone capabilities, the smartphone experience on iphone is excellent. I've used an ipad for a year, and the operating system is the same, so transition was seamless. The app store is quick, and has nearly anything you might want. It's far beyond this review to get into details of apps. As good as the iphone is, it does have a few quirks and I find I miss a couple of things. There's no message indicator light on iphone. You have to unlock the iphone to see if you have a text message, call, etc. I do miss not being able to glance at the phone to determine if I've missed a notification. iOS v4 has other limitations. Most annoying, you can't change the screen behavior in a charger (like a car charger/mount). The screen powers down after a few minutes (this is settable), or can be set to never power down (not good for battery life when not charging). Android will change this behavior easily. After a few days of searching, iphone doesn't have this capability, and no app supports it. The one killer app on Android is not yet on iphone: Google Navigation. I do miss this. The price was right on Android (free!), and I've not yet dived into the world of iphone Navigation apps. The Apple specific charger connection is both a blessing and a curse. A blessing, because all my ipod and ipad chargers worth with the iphone, including the docks in my bedroom alarm clocks. A curse, because you have to buy all-new accessories otherwise, like car chargers. I did find an excellent windshield mount at Best Buy (Rocketfish), which thankfully easily holds the iphone 4, and connects via micro USB, which I've already hard-wired in my car. As far as I can tell, iphone OS base screens do not work in landscape mode, a shame again for car mounts. A note about the virtual iphone keyboard: this was my biggest concern pre-purchase. Droid had the hard keyboard, and I text frequently. The iphone keyboard and touchscreen is excellent, and I adapted very rapidly to soft keys on iphone. Simply put, it works fine and I don't miss the hard keyboard at all. I'm nearly as fast when typing on iphone as I was on the Droid after only 4 days. I have big, fat fingers, so you should be fine. If I can soft-key, anyone can. These criticisms are minor compared to the overall experience. The iphone is a stunning piece of hardware, superior to the Droid I used for 14 months, and well worth the wait. 4 years of development of the operating system on iphone have polished a lot of things that Android is still working on. It's not perfect, but it's very, very good.
Got mine on 2/7/2011 and it has been great. Been with verizon for over 6 years and this is the best thing to ever happen to Verizon. The phone is so easy to use and the battery life has been great no issues. The hype about buttons being different and not being able to use the old AT&T cases is BS I have both the Otter Box Defender and Commuter and they work just fine!!!
I was nervous getting the iPhone with Verizon afraid there would be issues. It has been perfect! Very smooth! The phone does any and every thing! If u want the best phone this is it! And everyone already knows Verizon is the best service! Great team! Only problem I'm having is that I can't put the phone down! I wonder if there is an app that will sleep for me? Hmmm there is one for everything it seems! I got this awesome phone Monday, and I haven't put it down "much" since and even the battery life is great!
Fell in love with the color scheme, the cover goes on easily and does not interfere with the camera. I often like to switch covers (currently rocking an old school Gameboy cover) and wish that the Gameboy cover was of a similar quality to this cover (the Gameboy one interferes with flash pictures). The old saying is true-you get what you pay for. (Go with the accessory bundle package to save some $$)
This case provides SOME protection from accidental drops. The case on the phone is not bulky at all, but It feels slightly slippery in the hand, so gripping it may be an issue with some people. I wish I could find it in more colors. The essential 050 is hard to find for some reason.
Picked this case up when I bought my iPhone 4S on Sunday. I got it mostly because bb was having an accessories deal but I'm glad I did! Fits snuggly around the iPhone. The case is well made and all buttons and the headphone jack are easily accessible. Will protect from short drops and bumps but nothing major. Overall a great case!! The color looks really nice too against the white iPhone! Good case if your looking for something smaller.
All in all I like it....but I'm a little harder on my phone than I thought I would be so may have to also purchase an Otterbox.
Nothing fancy or impressive... I probably should have gotten a different color... anyway, it's fair...
I bought this b/c it was on sale and I saw it on another website and it had very good reviews. The other main reason for choosing this item is b/c it has the alarm clock/radio function in addition to the iPod speaker in one compact unit to be able to fit in my very limited space. It was easy to set up and generally easy to operate. I thought it had a dual alarm function, but it doesn't. or maybe I haven't figured it out yet. There's a free app from the iTunes app store that you need to get your iPod/iphone to work with your alarm dock, but it will still play music even if you don't control it thru the app. but I think the remote won't work to control the music that way. I was disappointed in the sound quality/volume that this speaker puts out especially when listening to music from my ipod/iphone.For some reason the sound when playing music from my iPod/phone plays at a very low volume even though I adjusted the volume on both the iPod and the speaker. The radio sounds better on this. it has limited volume and although I don't have a musical ear and I don't have any musical talent whatsoever, the music doesn't sound the way the artist intended for it to sound in my opinion. This item is expensive for what it is, even on sale. I looked at/listened to other similar items for around the same price, maybe a bit more but sounded much better. The reason I didn't get one of the others was because there was no clock/radio/alarm and they were too big for the available space. I kept this item anyway b/c it's suitable for my current setup/purpose in a small bedroom and/or office in which the volume is adequate for a small area. It does what i want for now. I also like the blue color of the display and it shines just bright enough to provide a little light when sleeping so the 1 foot or so directly in front of the clock is softly lit so it somewhat doubles as a nightlight. keep in mind I'm not bothered by things like that when sleeping and I'm a very sound sleeper, so even turned up to Max. volume the music doesn't always wake me. I lived right next to the subway and on a very busy street for a long time & was never bothered by it. I still need a backup alarm clock or 2 or 3. i haven't tried the buzzer for the alarm since I didn't have time to test it and at the time I set the alarm I had to be 100% sure that it would wake me in time. However, I have a feeling that the buzzer alarm on this is like many other alarm clocks these days that aren't even loud enough to hear when you're awake. So all in all it's not the greatest sounding speaker if your particular about having great sound, but it's useful to me and even though it was overpriced for what it is it's what i needed right now. It should be adequate for use in a bedroom/office like I'm using it now, but if you want something more powerful and better sounding this is not it.
I had two slider style cases that just didn't work. One broke near near the volume button area (weak design) and one comes apart every time I pull the phone out of my pocket. This one is fantastic. A little weird at first being a two part case but great once you get used to that. The hard shell is easy to take off (a requirement for putting it in a jogging case or speaker dock) and the rubber inner cover does seem to cushion it well. If it came in green we'd have two.
Got this and a screen for $35; pretty good deal, I suppose. Haven't dropped it yet, so still have to wait and see how well it protects the phone.
We bought this case and it arrived with a black front, not a blue one. Thinking it was a mistake, we brought it back to the store, checked the image online and the sku numbers and tried again. Black again. If you want the Otterbox phone case with a blue front, you will have to purchase it from another store. This one is black on the front, not blue, but no one at Best Buy.com can figure out the problem.
fit my iPhone 4 well, can put ID card or something else, easily accesse
This holster clips securely to my belt. It holds my iPhone snuggly enough that it won't fall out on accident, but not so tight that it becomes tough to remove. The magnetic closures hold secure as well. My primary beef with it is that it has a fuzzy lining that lets off from the very first use. I'm constantly having to wipe the fuzz off of my screen. I bought it due to the style and price. I think I'll probably go with one of the Otterbox Defenders instead.
With the Iphone 5 out, I finally upgraded to the 4s for a great price. The pictures from the default camera are great, display is sharper. My favorite improvement though is the much better sound on this model. The one thing I'm not impressed with is Siri. While entertaining, it generally cannot find what I'm looking for, usually redirecting to something similar. For instance, I ask for home painters and it gives me a list of retail paint shops. You have to be very, very specific and even then Google Voice will usually do a better job. Also, the battery life isn't the greatest. I make sure to delete apps from memory if I'm not currently using them.
It's a good phone. New keypad functions really well. Mic doesn't seem to work as well as my last phone and if the reception is weak, the phone beeps in your ear a lot. Camera works well but only for close up shots.
- Solid/Secure - Mounts to any bike. Mounted mine on Ritchey stem despite irregular cross-section. - Ball joint allows landscape or portrait or anything in between - easy to insert and remove phone - minimalist design (simple, few parts, lightweight), but if you're shaving grams you probably don't want your iphone mounted to your bike. - heads up...requires Lifeproof case (over the top protection which you may not like for everyday use).
I purchased the LifeProof case a few months ago and love it (it really works by the way. I have gone swimming with my phone in my hand). Anyway, I also use my bike quite a bit for exercise and was happy that LifeProof has a bike mount to use with their case. It is extremely easy to mount and safely and securely holds your phone on your bike. The mount allows you to rotate the phone in any direction you choose and the LifeProof case gives you easy access to your phone. If you are a bike rider this will be a great addition.
I am an obsessive 365-days-a-year bike commuter, and when I got a Lifeproof case for Christmas, I had to have one of these. (I LOVE my case, too, by the way.) Someone who knew something about bikes and cycling designed this. It comes with three different rubber shims to allow it to fit various handlebar clamp sizes (all the way up to 31.8mm). The ball mount allows you to tilt it in lots of different directions. It's easy to get your phone in and out, and it has an easy-to-use lock that you can slide so that you can be certain it won't fly off your bike (and it REALLY won't--more on that below). The mount itself also comes off very quickly and easily so that you can take it with you when locking your bike up in an area where it might get stolen. Since I've had this mount, I've had two crashes (bad luck!), and my phone, the case, and the mount were all 100% unharmed. In one of those crashes I lost front-wheel traction in the rain, got my handlebars all flipped around, and slid out. My handlebar mirror was smashed, and so was my knee, but my phone was just sitting there in the mount, good as new. The second of those crashes was even worse, and I ended up in the hospital with nasty injuries, but again, the phone was just sitting there on my handlebars like nothing had ever happened.
While riding my motorcycle, I quickly decided I needed a better way to navigate through the crazy city around me. Aleady having the lifeproof case (military makes this nearly necessary) I dec ided to try this product out. This is by far one of the best investments I've made to date. The mount comes with different sizes of rubber to allow a multitude of fittings and has multiple clamping positions. I've ridden for 4 hours at 70 mph speeds and the mount didn't move an inch. The best part was, with the ball tightened down, neither did the phone. Excellent purchase and highly recommended.
This is a great high quality mount. Have had this on my bike on some moderate trails and it was secure the whole time. It is one of the only mounts I know that allow you to have a (their) case on while it is mounted. Great build quality, worth every penny.
What they fail to mention is that for $40.00 you only get the holder but also need to purchase their own special case for your phone. Should have been a bit clearer on that so back it goes.
Looks very attractive and is made of solid material. But after about a month the outer design decorative material is now peeling off from several spots. This has been on my wife's phone and hasn't been treated harshly. Its never gotten wet and nobody tries to pick off the "taped" on design material. Piece of junk.
I love this phone, love using iCloud, iTunes Match and all the apps. This phone is my life and am constantly using the apps that I have. Love the fact that all my info is backed up in iCloud and iTunes match. Can't wait until the iPhone 5 comes out.
When I went to purchase this phone, the sales person had trouble getting it to charge in order to set it up. It was fine after that for 30 days and then it stopped charging. When I tried to return it the next day, I was told I was one day past the return date and so, since they had none in stock, they could not order me a new one.
The iPhone is fantastic! I am looking forward to all the great apps and things this phone can do for me. Apple makes there products so seamlessly and effortlessly. It's a pleasure to have a phone that works so well and has so many features which make my life easier. I love my iPhone and wouldn't hesitate in buying another.
It's good. This is the first ihone I ever used and I am really impressed with this.
Some improvement in features makes it better and faster than the previous generation iPhones. I tried Atrix but returned it within a week. If you liked previous iPhones, stick with it and upgrade to the new one.
Complements our itunes and ipad nicely giving us additional mobile capacity. We find that this uses more bandwidth than our ipad thanks to mapping and other services we use on the go
I switched from a Blackberry Curve to an iPhone. At first I wasn't too happy because I had trouble creating my own ringtones and I wanted to return the phone and go back to the Blackberry. Once a clerk at the store taught me, it worked great, but you must be computer-savy to figure it out. I'm still not happy with the choice of only one email alert. The Blackberry could set any ringtone for your email alert, but the iPhone only has one choice, on or off. Not happy with that. Overall, I have adjusted to the change, minus the email alert problem, and I'm happy with the phone. Maybe a future update will have the email alert options.
iPhone 4 is a great improvement over 3GS. Multi-tasking is coming handy, retina screen is amazing, the same easy - intelligent - intuitive handling, that no one on the market can beat. Simply the best, ever!
The previous review confuses me a bit. As far as muting when in an otter box...I think that is more of a fault on the otter box and not the phone. I think Apple did some modifications with the white iphone because I experience much less signal drop than I did with my black one. I have owned every generation of iPhone, as well as two android phones, and I have to say, anything other than an iPhone is a wanna-be copycat. The touch functionality of the iPhone is far superior than that of an android or palm phone. Its so smooth and sleek. Apple is doing it right by being selective of the apps that are allowed on the phone. I remember with my old Treo, I would have to reset the phone often due to faulty or malicious programs that I would install. This keeps malware and spyware off of the phone. Bottom line, you wont be disappointed by this phone, at all.
Great phone, had it in black and i liked it,got the white one and liked it also but can't use any case with it ( like otterbox defender or other heavy duty case) keeps putting calls on mute when using those cases
I bought this because it is cute. I wanted cute. I need cute. I dropped my phone today, and it is just fine. My cover did protect my phone... And in case you are wondering, the cover held up and is still cute!
Its great but hard to clip off i had to use a key to take it off but overall ot good!!!!!
It is more of a skin than a case. There is no protective value to this skin. Rigid clip-on style skin that would probably break if dropped. Also quite overpriced.
Great product but they need to come out with an iphone5 compatible version now that apple ditched the 30 pin connector.
Like the case and love that it is waterproof. I have tried it under water. It works but still makes me nervous to put it in water. Bought it with reward certificates. I don't think I would have paid the full price for it.
This case has been so much fun. First I tested it underwater without the phone inside (warranty requirement) then the fun began. "Accidentally" dropping into water around friends gets great reactions. Taken some pictures underwater (a few inches) and they are great. This case slips easily in and out of your pocket. The only complaint is the headphone jack. You have to have an adapter to plug your headphones in, but this is due to the case being water proof, so I can live with it. After a bike ride or run, I just rinse the phone off under the tap and it's cleaned right up. This is a great case for your iphone.
I had 2 Otter Box cases previous for my iPhone. I am prone to drop my phones and didn't want to take the chance with such a fragile phone like the iPhone. The Otter Box, although very protective, doesn't last long. The rubber stretches out within 2 months. A friend recommended the LifeProof and I haven't looked back. I've dropped my phone a handful of times and nothing is wrong. I haven't droped it in water or anything like that but after doing the test the video said to do I am certain my phone will be protected. I like that it isn't bulky like the Otter Box. I wish a belt clip was included but still would recommend it highly.
I recently purchased a lifeproof case took it in the pool completely screwed on and ready, blew out speakers and flash on camera wont turn on
This case provides excellent protection - waterproof, dustproof. The only drawback is the 'door' to the charging port; if it opened just a tiny bit more it would be easier to connect and disconnect the charging cord. But I would still recommend spending the extra dollars on this case over the other available options.
I love the size and weight of this case. After 2 days I had to rip the seal off of the ear speaker so I could hear people. Also, using the speaker phone is useless as no one can understand you because of the seal. I understand this is protected for water but if I can't take a phone call where I can hear people what is the point? The charger slot is SUPER tight! Even my apple charger for my ipad is too big. None of my after market charger work, only the apple iphone charger works and it is still very tight to remove the charger. I do still like the case, sad I had to remove a seal on the phone though. I emailed the company today so I will followup if they contact me.
For people who think that this case is too expensive, stop and think about this case compared to others. The Apple Bumper Case, half the price as this case that breaks within a few months. The LifeProof feels almost just like the bumper case with just a lithe back cover. Also, this is WATERPROOF! Do you know all the opportunities this will open up for the average iPhone user? I have brought this thing in the pool, lake and river. I used a bluetooth sound system at the river and could change songs with out the worry of my iPhone getting wet. You can play music through your iPhone speakers which sounds louder than normal, and then bring it under water, where the water amplifies the sound even more! You can also bring this in the shower and do what ever you'd like, if you know what I mean. Overall spending $70 on this is definitely worth it because it will probably last about 5 years.
I'm reviewing this after having the case for 6 months. It's the summer and you now want to use this case in the water. Don't risk it. The case is very fragile when it comes to water. The most common flaw with this case is the speaker membranes not the o-ring that wraps around the whole phone backing. Believe me, it happened to me. I'm not gonna lie the case works in the water, but you have to follow the Lifeproof rules and the average person is not going to bother after the first test. Before using the case, it must be water tested. Before going in the water, it must be tested. I did not test before going into the water. It turned out there was a tiny hole in the ear piece membrane that allowed water to infiltrate. The first sign was fog in the lens and then water behind the screen protector. Then I started seeing fog in the actual iPhone lens and the water actually completed the circuit to the led light to where the light was on even when the power was turned off. My phone was still functional till it got to the backlit of the screen. The screen worked but not the light and now I think it's finished. No response in iTunes. Luckily it was the iPhone 4S and I had Apple Care + which will cover accidental liquid damage for a fee of $50. I only get two replacements. If you really want to take your iPhone in the water, your best bet is to Liquipel the phone and use this case. You have two times the protection. On the bright side, this case protects your phone from drops. It's much sleeker than Otterbox. If you buy this case with your phone, your phone will be well preserved and when you want to sell it, the exterior will be in mint condition. You also wont have to worry about the rain or getting splashed on. There is some downside. You can't use old iPhone chargers and third party chargers. The headphone jack is annoying and you can't use iHome. You have to get rid of your old screen protector. If you want no hassle, just Liquipel the phone and get an Otterbox and don't take it underwater at all. Get a Go Pro.
I don't have to worry about dropping my iPhone or getting it wet - my new Lifeproof case has it protected.
I wanted something to protect my phone without the bulk of the Otter; Lifeproof fit the bill. However, I have to remove the case if the audio system I use only has an iPod/iPhone jack/connection :((. I purchased extra connectors and replacement caps so that I could have one in the car and at work (I teach group fitness) as well as on the earphones that I use at home.
It is strange that I question the durability of a case named Lifeproof. The screen protector is good but there is a lot of glare but it does the job well. The speakers still work as does the microphone. For being a waterproof case the bulk is less than some regular cases and that is the main reason I bought it. There are however a couple of major chinks in the Lifeproof case. The first being the headphone adapter. The thing is so flimsy and loses connection with the iPhone easily. It would be nice to have a smaller more ridged one available. The second is where mine failed, the dock flap. How mine failed is beyond me, I noticed it after waking up when I pulled the charger out of the base I felt a crack when clicking the flap back in place. I had not dropped it or stepped on it so I have no idea how this could have broken but now that it is cracked all the way through this case is no longer water proof and is for all intents and purposes a bad screen protector and an annoyance if I use headphones. This case was purchased so that I wouldn't need to replace the cheap ones so I didn't mind the price. Now I have to spend 30 bucks for a replacement back piece. I also had to purchase the dock extender to work with my stereo.
this is the best case that i have ever used and will probably ever use again. before this case i have been really close to ruining my phone when i was using my (otter box defender). i have spilled stuff near the phone, gotten water on it and finally most of all dropping it. the otter box is good for protecting against dropping but not water so when my old case broke from general wear i had to make the decision on what case to get. as soon as you touch this case you can feel a real difference its not bulky it hugs the phone, so with anyone who hates to put case on their phones cause their bulky heres the answer to that. final the main feature of the phone case is water proofing and i was a little like i don't think it really is going to work however straight from the box (after reading instal papers a must) i dropped it into water and was shocked it really works my phone survived. also drop protection works to.
I tested it by dropping it in a cooler full of ice and water. Left it there for to minutes, then called. It worked just fine.
- very easy to install - keeps the phone pristine - still takes good pictures. - need to buy a dock extender because most plugs beyond the OEM plug won't work with the case
As soon as a I saw the lifeproof case I immediately bought it. Who wouldn't want a, no pun intended, life proof case? Well the first day I bought it I accidently dropped my phone from about chest height and, the case broke. I then got another and noticed that the sound quality was terrible and the phone speaker wasmuffled heavily. It was waterproof, I put it in a bowl of water and submerge it and my phone was fine. Also, there is a noticeable gap between the screen protector and the screen itself which took away from the responsiveness of the touch screen. I have since returned it and moved on to an Otterbox defender and removed the screen protector and replaced it with a Zagg cover.
I like this product, will continue to use it because it takes away the fear of dropping your iphone, getting it wet, or scratching the screen or back. In other words, it can truly take a beating in this case. However, not surprisingly, it makes the phone rather bulky, and the rubber rim makes it especially hard to get your phone out of your pocket when someone's calling you. The most annoying part, however, is that the clear protective screen, after about a week of use, has formed what looks like an oil spot where the keypad is (where your fingers touch it the most). I've removed the phone and cleaned thoroughly, but can't get it to go away. It doesn't make the phone unusable, it's just an annoying drawback, like you've constantly got a smudge on the bottom part of your screen.
I bought one because my iphone started to rust within and apparently now the situation is solved. I think a great product maybe overpriced for what it is. Main advantage it is not bulky nor ugly like the competitors. Other small problem none of the manufacturer thought of putting a clip that would clip to women purse inside or out that would be convenient and pretty at the same time.
I highly recommend this product. Pricey, but worth it.
Yes, it is a very expensive case, but it is only 10% of the phone's retail cost. Very slim, it doesn't drag out my pockets. It is not a tacky finish like silicone based covers, but maintains a good grip. I am not prone to test limits, but I have seen an otherwise sane person throw her phone across the room. I have used it in the tub whilst soaking aching muscles Negative; the power synch port is cut exactly to fit the original Apple cord. Only one after market cord (Kuhmo) fits in to charge or synch. Since all aftermarket accessories seem to be about the same cost as original, save yourself trouble and by genuine Apple.
After having had water damage on a previous iPhone I knew full well what water damage can do to one. So, when I heard about these wonderful "everything proof" cases I figured it was cheap insurance to cough up the $80+ price for the case. After 6 months of careful use (I'm a stay at home dad, so most of the time it's sitting on a table or in my pocket) the charging port door developed a near invisible hair-line crack. While on vacation I took the phone into the water to film my son on his first time snorkeling in the Caribbean. That was all it took to fry my phone. The crack in the door allowed water into the case and that was fatal to the phone. There IS no recovery from seawater with an iPhone. So IF you buy this case be diligent to inspect it very carefully if you intend on using it around water. DO NOT just trust, as I did, that the case was the "Anywhere, Anytime" case that they advertise it to be. I'm living proof that it isn't.
My romance with the lifeproof case was short lived. Other than the novelty of telling people the case was water proof (which WAS its only useful function), there is little else to discuss. The case is poor quality and is in shambles since I purchased it months ago. You may argue that I was rough on the case, but for $80.00 you expect a product that would be able to stand up to 3 falls from waist height....it hasn't. I will be purchasing an otterbox soon. I will however miss youtubing in the shower.
I wanted a case that can keep dust and lint from my phone when carrying it in my pockets and this does that perfectly. The built-in screen shield is also perfectly clear with no noise or grain. It's like there's not even a screen protector. Since the screen shield doesn't stick to the phone's screen, you don't have to fight with air bubbles or lint between the screen and the shield. Although it gets finger prints easily, it's very easy and simple to just wipe it with warm wet paper towel since the case is water proof. Or heck, you can just use your shirt. The design is also very attractive and it's very slim. It's not much thicker than the iphone 4s itself. Unlike some users, I have no problems with sound. The lifeproof site stated the sound issue is a problem with the phone and teaches you how to solve it, though I don't know how true this is. There are a few minor problems that may affect some people: 1) The USB slot for charging is very small. My 3rd party USB chargers can't fit into it. 2) You have to unscrew the cork to plug in earphones. This is annoying if you don't use a bluetooth headset instead. 3) It's impossible to flick the mute switch while the phone is in this case. I suggest you try this case out. Keep the receipt and if you don't like it, return it for a full refund. It's easy to repackage everything.
I think the case is great and does exactly what is advertised to do but I was bummed out to find out that I wasn't able to use any aftermarket iPhone chargers because it won't fit in the flip down door. Secondly I can't use any of my aftermarket headphones except for the factory Apple headphones. Buyers beware that most of your aftermarket chargers,USB cords and headphones won't work.
I bought this for my daughter's iphone 4. Great low profile, integrated look for the phone. She has not dropped it or spilled water on it, but it does look like it is well protected. The only two cons or drawbacks are the price (costs more than average covers) and the fact that not all charging docs or cords fit with this case on. one out of my 3 recharging cords fit.
Case seems to be doing it's intended job so far, but, I am not thrilled with the clear screen cover. It's not nearly as touch sensitive as my previous protection case.
I bought a Lifeproof case in Best Buy last week. I followed all the instructions and use my phone underwater (about 1 foot deep) for video for about 15 minutes. It worked at first, then bubbles went out of the speaker hole cover. Then my iPhone 4 has problem with its flash light and it would not turn off even I completely shut down my phone. When I opened the charger cover there is water running out of it! Obviously the case did not protect my phone as it is expected. Do not believe their videos on Youtube. You are under risk on your own! They already claim they have NO liability for any property loss caused by this case, but on the package they tell you to take it to snorkeling! When I called them for the whole day there is only voice mailbox and nobody answers. One more con is: you cannot take pictures under water with this case. Because finger touch does not work in water! Only thing you can do is starting video recording before enter into water and keeping it running. Not very convenient
Everyone told me to get a otter box, but i was interested in a waterproof case. The only issue i have with this case is the flap that covers the usb port has broken off after 3 months. never dropped it. Maybe otter box is the way to go.
This is ideal for those who are paranoid about having their phone destroyed. The only downside is you would have to buy an extender to use it on a docking station or if you want to use the mirroring feature on the iPhone 4s while still having it on. The touch response can be a little hampered as well from the screen protection. This is not a case to take off and on a lot. Whats nice is that its water proof but if it dropped in deep water I am not sure it would float.
Phone dropped in the pool within 1 week of purchase. Saved me $600
I've had this case for over 3 months now and haven't looked back. Yes, its waterproof. Hands down so kick butt to be able to take this underwater and shoot video and pics. Dropped it many times.. no problems. trashed it outside. Love being able to run it under the faucet to clean it. No problems with the touch screen. Call or voice clarity is great. No problems. Like the case isn't even on. It's not bulky like other cases. Very slim for the protection that it offers your phone. This is a case where a company creates a product and knocks it outa the park. It's that good. The is the best iphone case you can get. Hands down, no if's and's or but's..
The Lifeproof case is the ULTIMATE case for the iPhone. It doesn't make the phone much bigger, yet it provides drop protection, scratch protection, and even water protection. All without affecting the sound quality or the touch screen sensitivity. Now I don't worry about my iPhone. I listen to music in the shower and even while swimming (with their water proof headphones). The only thing to look out for is to check the seals after a big drop. Oh, and a few times the raised home button got pressed while in my pocket. So just be aware of that...
Best phone cover by far!!! saved my phone many, many times! A bit pricey but worth the investment!
I have one black case and one white case. The Lifeproof case is the perfect case for everyday use, accidents, and intentional exposure to water, dust, snow, etc. The Lifeproof case is rugged, but very slim with little bulk added to the phone. My Lifeproof case has saved my phone several times already from accidental exposure to water, both at work and home, and has been used to take some great underwater pictures. Lifeproof has great, professional, and dedicated customer service and will take care of any (very few) issues that might arise during your use of their product. I love my Lifeproof case and can't wait until they come out with products to protect my other electronics as well.
Definitely worth $79.99. I decided to do the water test today (no phone inside), leaving it under water in the sink & weighed down for an hour. No water inside! The best part is now the screen cover feels a lot smoother after doing that! I've only had it for a day now, but I am already happy with it. I don't plan on EVER actually having my phone underwater since ya never know if it could leak that one time.. but I will definitely not be afraid of rain! Never drop my phones either.. Might be overdoing it with this case, but I'd rather protect it (def. from rain) now so I can sell the phone later when it's time for the iPhone 5 =) Now if only they made one with a kickstand.. maybe they could make an an attachable one =) Or I'll try to make one myself some how haha!
Just bought this case today at the Best Buy on 622 Broadway in Manhattan NY. Took a chance before researching and love it. I've had the Ballistic and the Otterbox both of which clips broke. The case themselves were good but bulky by comparison to the Lifeproof case. The Lifeproof is made of a different material than that rubber used on the aforementioned cases. WOW no lint. The waterproof feature sure puts my worries to rest. I read some of the negative comments about this case. I resolved as follows: Oil slick under protector- shake a container of baby powder, turn screen protector upside down, hold above open bottle, squeeze, fine mist = no oil slick. As for the headphone issue I use the Rocketfish RF-MAB2 bluetooth headphones. Excellent sound with a built in mic to answer calls (love these). The only complaint I have was that at the Best Buy on 622 Broadway I was followed around like a criminal buy what i assume was a store investigator. I know a certain amount of footwork is necessary in that profession but this person crossed the line. Time for some retraining. Really wanted to leave but i needed the case.
I have had the iphone 4 for only 2 weeks, but knew that I needed some really great protection for it. It fell in the sink the first day, then on the floor 2 days later, and it was put on the counter in a puddle twice. I did a lot of research and went to Best Buy after reading all the reviews and bought the Lifeproof cover after reading VERY positive reviews on it. NO problem getting used to the new plastic cover at all! It was $79.99, but to me, was better than paying insurance on it. The cover is light and looks nice, I think : ) I love this cover so far. I have NO complaints at all!
I purchased this case because I wanted to see how a slimmer box cover would be compared to Otterbox which I have been using for years! First impression I think it is a pretty cool design concept! Yes it is totally water proof but I myself do not plan on taking my expensive piece of technology into water! My biggest problem with the case was the screen cover! I cleaned my phone and case before I placed it in like the directions said to do! After doing so I noticed and oily spot! So I pressed around on the screen cover and it disapeared. Then after a while of using my iPhone like I usually do it came up again! So I decided to open the case and take my phone out and clean it again! Note in the directions it says the case is not made to be opened more than 50 times! So this was the second time opening it because you are instructed to do a water test before you even put the phone in! After cleaning my phone and case a second time the same oily spot came up! If your the type person that things like that don't bother you then you should have no problem with this case! But if you are like me then I say do not get this case! I returned mine and got the new Otterbox Realtree Camo case! To me bulky is well worth knowing my phone is protected over a slimmer case!
product speaks for itself ! Indestructible! and FULL GUARANTEE !!!
THis is a great concept, but really a pain to use. You need a special cord with a small adapter. A regular cord won't work. To make it truly waterproof, you need to keep an ear phone adapter screwed in all the time. This means you have this wobbly thing plugged that is very awkward when you use it as a phone. I would return mine if I could.
Great case It feels good in your hand and is nice and slim. Only complaint is the sound quality is a bit muffled I believe you lose about 20% loss of volume. I guess this is due to being completely waterproof. I have yet to take mine for a Swim but have washed it off in the sink. Facebook feedback is truly telling with lots of product failure due to being a new start up company. I would recommend. White is awesome and of it gets dirty can be washed. Great concept and would recommend. Hope the company fixes the glitches for the future customers. Had to return my first one due to speaker being broken. Second one fine. Touch screen works gr8
This purchase was actually a Christmas gift for my boss. My daughter has one and showed it to me and I immediately knew it would be a great gift for him. I want one for myself but I don't yet have the 4 and it's not made for others yet. With my daughters, I watched as she dropped it in a glass of water and left it there for 10 minutes with no damage to the phone. Then she let her 15-month old throw it around to show me. Amazing! I'm already on the list to have one for the iPad when it comes out as a gift for my Dad.
I am a mother of four and I have been pretty hard on past phones so when I got the new iPhone 4s I knew I needed something that could protect it well. We were planning a trip to the Florida Keys and when I saw this case it seemed the perfect fit. $80 seemed a bit steep for a phone case but I justified it by the fact I could take it on the dive boat, to the pool and also the beach without fear of it getting damaged by water and sand. I now have a phone, camcorder and camera all in one that is protected. I wasn't taking any chances so I followed all the steps on the website. I am sure glad I did as there was a small hole in the cover near the microphone. Took it back to Best Buy and they replaced it without a problem. This case has already proven itself. At one point on the trip it ended up in a trash can. Found it and just washed it off! It has also been dropped a few times. I took it in the pool and got some great pictures and videos of the kids. No worries for the summer at swim team practice. Now they just to hurry up and release one for my iPad to protect it from the kids!
Purchased for my daughter on Black Friday weekend. She used it about 3 weeks before is started making her Apple iPhone 4 overheat and turn off. She also lost the headphone jack cover (i.e. screw). Best Buy does not carry replacements. Only place to order was on the LifeProof web site. Had to order 3 at a cost of about $5 each.
Love this because it's obvious I have a white iPhone. I didn't want to cover the color of my phone but I wanted to protect it. Love that it's waterproof because I have dropped past phones in water.
I got this to protect my Iphone from the same fate that my EVO 4G suffered. A cracked screen. This is VERY good protection. However you cant but this phone on a dock because of the bottom. Maybe makes some sort of extension. Also my rocket fish car charger plug wouldnt fit and I had to chop off the plastic of the rocket fish to make it work.
This is, by far, the best case for active people! I am a coach, so I constantly have my phone on me outside. I have had this is rain and shine, wind and cold, and it hasn't failed me. The only issue I had was the charging cover got a crack in it, but I messaged the company directly, and they are sending a new back for my phone to fix the problem. 3 e-mails, and the issue was solved. Not a lot of companies provide that kind of customer service.
This case is pretty awesome...but having to use the dongle to insert the headphones is a bit of a pain. And the case prevents the use of any dock.
I love the Lifeproof Case, but the inside cover can be VERY easily scratched, so be careful when you are trying to get the dust off the inside when you are installing the thing. The outside seems really strong and scratch proof. They do have a long drawn out process to make sure it is waterproof, but I really didn't plan on swimming with or showering with my phone just need the occasional splash protection. It is a pretty strong case, and lightweight!!! Good buy!! A little pricey is why I put it lower on the rating..
They need to make the next Lifeproof case with wider headphone and charger openings to fit aftermarket accessories. OEM charger and earbuds fit fine but not all aftermarket headphones and chargers fit. My Griffin car charger and Skullcandy ear buds do not plug in to the phone with the case on. There is a headphone adapter that comes with the case but is very annoying to take everywhere. Minus one star for headphone capatibility and minus another star for charger compatibility. Almost there Lifeproof, work those kinks out.
Charging is a pain. I can not use the chargers with the thicker connection interface. The fact that you have to use the audio connection supplied to use headphones is inconvenient. I find myself having to open the case to do these things which defeats the purpose.
They claim you can drop it from a distance of up to 2 meters....I don't plan on doing that. However, I am fully aware of the exorbitant cost of a new iphone when you are not getting the new contract price and it's fully worth it to protect your phone which is glass front and back (i don't agree with that design).
Two weeks ago I would have given this product five stars. As someone who is really rough with phones, it protected my iPhone against falls, coffee spills and even a bad incident where a leaking to-go box of food drenched the case in fish sauce. The phone was fine. I especially loved being able to use it in the pouring rain. However, after less then four months, the adapter for the headset (which you have to screw in to the top of the case) broke. Unless I held the adapter a specific way, I could not hear my music nor could people hear me when I was on a phone call. A new adapter is $20. Total bummer because I love everything else about the case.
When I first got the case is was a bit discouraged about the feel of the touch screen. My IP4S didn't feel right anymore. But after a few days I got use to the extra force one must do to operate the phone, and now I can barely tell. As for some reviewer saying the charger doesn't fit, this is not true for my case. Yes, no aftermarket charger I've used fits into the case, but the one that comes with the iPhone works perfect. The speaker sound from the case does sound a bit murky, my solution to his is just open the flip cover for the charger (if your just sitting in work desk and not worried about the surrounding elements hurting your iPhone# and the sound is almost as good as without the case #ALMOST#. After about a month with the case I can tell you that I didn't notice any of the inconveniences I first had when getting the case. The LIFREPRROF case has been on my iPhone since the day I bought it, and hasn't been removed since. #Accessories worth mentioning that work excellent with my iPhone is (A# the Sony MW-600 Bluetooth earphones. Now with the new Bluetooth profile, the song playing or the person calling is displayed on the tiny led screen of the unit. #B)The Bose Sound link though a bit expensive sounds pretty amazing for such a small unit)
I just upgraded form the iPhone 3G, and I was so excited to get the 4s. I definitely wanted something that would protect my new phone. I am more than happy with my decision to purchase this case. It is very slim (compared to otter box) and it is very solid. It was a very nice and secure fit on my phone, and I love that it is completely waterproof. I love the fact that it doesn't grip your pants when you put your phone in your pocket. I've had other cases in the past that would do that, but this one doesn't. I would recommend this to anyone! Especially those that live very active outdoor lives, or are around children a lot. It gives me the peace of mind, and I'm sure it will give you the same :D
Ok, so I am not going to try and sell you on this case. But I must say that for the money it offers you peace of mind. The case is very slimming and looks great. If you are also like me and have the iphone in black and always wanted it in white the case looks even more amazing. I have the Iphone 4s and the case is a snug fit and looks great. The screen protecter is not flush all the way to the screen and so yes you do have to hit the screen s little bit more harder. I mean very little. In a few days with the case you will not even realize it. The water proof feature does work. I have taken calls in the shower and text as well in water. I would not fully recomend taking the case diving when on vacation but if you drop your phone in a puddle or spill a drink on it, rest assured your phone will be unharmed. If you are on the fence about spending the $80, I say it is worth it knowing that your phone is protected from just about any reasonable thing besides a car running over it. PS the sound reduction is really not bad to any person that is not always watching a movie off there iphone with the speaker.
I did a lot of research before purchasing this case. Having used Otterbox cases for my phones, I had a particular standard and expectation about how a case should protect. The two things that appealed to me the most about LifeProof was its waterproofing and slim form factor features. After watching all of the videos, reading the forums and trying out the case myself, here's my verdict: the case is very impressive. It completely lives up to its claims about making the iPhone waterproof and shock proof (can't wait for snowboard season to test the snow proof). For the first few days, I loved scaring people by "accidentally" dropping the phone into water. The other thing I really like is how truly thin it keeps the phone. My wife still uses the Otterbox for her iPhone 3GS and it's twice the size. While it does add about 1/3 of an extra inch in length it hasn't really bothered me. What I do have issue with is that the screen interface and sensitivity is reduced a little bit. For the most part, it's been ok but I do have to make a few extra tap attempts when needing to press around the edges of the screen. This has been the biggest point of contention for the LifeProof's critics, so it really becomes a subjective assessment for each individual. For me, I can live with it because the benefits outweigh this particular concern. The other small issues are the buttons. Interestingly, the case covers all of the buttons, affecting each of them differently. The main menu button actually becomes more sensitive which has accidentally turned the phone on when in my pocket. The power button has become a little more difficult to press and the way they designed the covering of the audio select switch causes it to work in the reverse (push up to mute and down for sound). Again, all of these are a small compromise for everything else this case provides. I recently had to use my SquareTrade warranty for my iPad2 when the screen cracked. This caused me to think about purchasing a warranty for my iPhone, but honestly, I think LifeProof may be all of the added protection I need. my advice, if you need a truly minimalist experience with a phone case, leaving the screen and buttons unaffected or hindered then this case may not be for you. If you are really looking for solid protection and are ok with using bulky cases like the Otterbox than the LifeProof case is definitely worth checking out.
I have used this case for a while now, and while I understand the few complaints such as cable compatibility and screen cover not fitting tightly, these are very minor compared to the level of protection it provides. Even while offering unparalleled protection it remains extremely thin and stylish. This thing is cool. In my opinion it matches the iPhone 4s itself in quality and innovation. I have absolutely no affiliation with Lifeproof, I'm just a very picky consumer who insists on near perfection. This case comes close to that standard. I have given it only 4 stars until I see how it holds up over time, but so far, I believe this is easily the best tough case and perhaps the best case period!
At first glance this case seemed like it would solve all of my problems. I received the case today. It looks and feels kind of cheap. The screen protector doesn't sit well on the phone (did all the tricks to fix that) . There is a "bezel" on the backside of the proximity sensor that makes the protector separate from the phone screen. Also, visibility is greatly reduced because the screen protector is so shiny. Outside it's nearly impossible to see the screen, even with the brightness turned all the way up. The speaker output is greatly reduced, more so than anyone let on. I had a very hard time hearing my brand new loud iPhone 4s. For me, that is a deal breaker in itself. Charging the phone while in the case is also difficult. I ordered a dock extender (from Amazon b/c life proof was out of them) and it didn't fit. The door that you must open to charge/sync is in the way, even when fully opened. The fact that you need to take a dock extender everywhere you go, if you want to charge your phone is too much hassle. I really wanted to like this case. But for everyday college use, it's not for me. There are too many inconveniences for me. In my opinion, it would be great for a camping/hiking trip. I'll be returning mine and searching for something else. ]
I' so happy with this case, it save my iPhone® 4..it fold down in 10 "of water nothing happened is the best money spent to protect my iPhone® 4....
This case is great if you are using it for sports that involve elements you need to protect your phone from, ie. water. I only gave it three stars based on the reduced screen sensitivity with this case, the difficulty hearing a caller and the caller hearing me, and the size of the case. This may have been the sleekest case at one time but the Otterbox Reflex line is the exact same thickness as the LifeProof case and it is not as long. I can't figure out where the extra length is coming from on the LifeProof case but it makes it harder for smaller hands to hold and text comfortably with.
I first read about the LifeProof case on a tech blog. For about 2 weeks I repeatedly went to the product website and debated on spending the money, especially with a new iPhone coming out. I was worried about spending so much money on a case that might be "obsolete" within weeks. I went ahead and purchased the case directly from the LifeProof website and when it came I went right to work, testing the case empty underwater. It worked perfectly. I was a few days into using my case when several people commented that when in a phone call I sounded distant. I went and looked up this issue online and it was noted that sometimes there is a small flaw with the membrane covering the microphone which doesn't allow sufficient vibrations to transmit sound. I contacted the manufacturer and they replaced my case with the Gen 2 case. Now the case works flawlessly, both for the watertight/drops and the sound quality. Overall, I HIGHLY recommend this case, especially if you're someone who doesn't purchase AppleCare for your phones. The case is expensive, but it may save you much more money in the end!
This case was the end to my search for the perfect case. I wanted a slim case that didn't add much bulk to the phone, was waterproof and drop proof. This was it! Other cases had some of the features but none had all. This case allows you to use all the buttons on your phone, you can charge the phone in the case with the original apple cable (others may not fit but they do have the Radtech adapter to use any cable or dock you may have) the screen is perfect either right out the box or after a short break-in period (it can take a few days to flatten upon initial install. When I opened the box initially I was a little surprised, the case felt so light and almost flimsy, no way this could do everything they say. After you put in on it transforms into a sturdy and attractive cover. I used to be a fanatic about always putting my phone back in a holster in fear of dropping it and carrying ziplock bags around to keep it from getting wet. No more! I stuff my phone in my pockets now, fear no rain, use it in hot tubs, spill stuff on it and simply dont worry. You do have to follow their instructions to ensure waterproofness, initial water test without phone, inspect all seals before immersion, and retest after a major drop. No case will guarantee that your phone will never break, but I trust Lifeproof more than any other case. I've had a white, black and now purple one, just because I couldn't decide what color was best. Call quality is great and the case feels great in your hand. I keep a spare as I don't ever want to be without this case. On the rare occasion I take the case off I'm sure I'll break my phone and worry until I put it back on. I've had these cases for 4 months now and they still look brand new. No scratches on the screen, I do clean it with a damp cloth or just detergent and water in a sink. Dry increases the risk of scratches. Try it! You'll love it.
As an iPhone 4 user I've gone through so many cases only to be disappointed and would continue my search for that perfect case. That search stops here with the LifeProof case... No more wasting money on cases for me, this is truly the end all of searching since I found this case and company. Who doesnt want a mil spec case that is really waterproof, shockproof, dirtproof, and snowproof? I've had my case for awhile and have nothing but high remarks for this product and company. Excellent/innovative/magnificent thin design and access to all the buttons and charge port without removing the case, can't beat that, I honestly can't wait to see what this company has in store for us next, I'll be a LifeProof'er for life! So what are you waiting for? Ditch those other wannabe cases and get a LifeProof. Let's Go!
I love it it's hot and it keeps your phone safe ! Water snow dirt drop it whatever and your phone will still work and look great ! This case kicks other case to the curb ! Must have
I have this case in white and my husband has black we love them! He is on the swat and dive team at the pd and the phone has held up threw all kinds of thing it's sleek light weight and works great we love it life with out iPhone in a Lifeproof case is so much more fun and relaxed not having to worrie
When I bought this case I thought, why test the case for waterproof-ness if I never would trust it enought to put my phone under water in it!? I never did test the case for waterproof-ness as the directions instruct. I knew I would never trust it that far. That is a risk I just would never take. I like the case though, I hang out at the beach alot and would NOT be afraid if it got splashed or dropped into the sand. I wouldn't be fearful if it dropped from my person while riding my bike either. I took it out of the case for a few days, but worried about droppoing it everywhere I went; then put it back in. I think I use the blutooth feature alot so I am not so worried about the sound quality but it seems fine to me. I think it's probably overpriced and it would pay to shop around. I see from other reviews that my gut not trusting the waterproof-ness is probably valid. Good case... good value... maybe, but lower your expectations when it comes to waterproof, just buy an underwater camera... The belt clip comes in handy too.
I was a little concerned when purchasing this whether it would affect being able to hear during a phone conversation, or listening to music considering it is completely enclosed. Very pleasantly surprised to find that it doesn't affect anything at all. I work in a rather dirty environment and chose white to match the phone- it cleans off really easily, just something to keep in mind if you are not sure of what color to choose. I feel that my phone is VERY well protected and am very happy with my purchase
Overall this case is AMAZING!! I have tried the phone underwater and it still works perfectly! Case is very durable, I have dropped my phone a few times already and it still works great with no disruption--I took the phone out of the case and still no scratches or water damage--its awesome!
Very rugged case, handles all the outdoor situations a summer director and father of 3 can throw at it. Slim and easy to grip. Only major gripe is need for headset adapter. Seems they could built adapter into case. Otherwise all around best case I've had for any iPhone. Highly recommend.
I would not recommend buying the waterproof cover by LifeProof for the iPhone. LifeProof, AT&T (who sold it to us) or Apple do not cover the phone getting water damage from the case (yes we tested it for 24 hours beforehand and registered it). AT&T says they did not realize this when they sold the case to us less than a month ago, when they told us LifeProof would cover any damage. IF SOMETHING SOUNDS TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE, IT PROBABLY IS.
Decided to buy a Lifeproof case a couple of days ago. So far its been one of the best cases I've own! I use to be very careful with my phone up until a month ago when I just started dropping it constantly. After two cases, I decided to go with this one and see what the fuss was all about! First of all, its very slim and very lightweight. Probably one of the lightest cases I've own. It lives up to the claim of being waterproof as I left my phone submerged for a few minutes with a video playing and nothing happened! I can even drop this phone and no damaged to the phone at all! One thing I was really worried about is the video quality. Luckily, the built-in screen protector actually helps retain the visual acuity of the retina display. Only complaints I have about the case is that I can only use my original apple cable for charging so it loses all functionality within my car! And of course you can not dock the phone with this case, but then again, any case I've own in the past that was worth anything also ran into that problem. It just one of those tradeoffs. Overall, I'm very pleased with this case! If you are looking for something to protect you phone and not be as bulky as an Otterbox, this is the phone case to go with!
Watched their instructional video, walked through their instructions (including holding the case under water for 30 minutes before putting on iphone), never took the phone below 3 feet of water. After two weeks the case leaked, soaking my iphone. Left my iphone in a bowl of rice for three days. It works, but is unresponsive sometimes, home button has problems, and warranty is void. Many people love the case and have rated it very high. LifeProof must have quality control issues because a lot of people have complained about the case leaking. LifeProof needs to address the lack of quality control and respond to all of those of us who have lost hundreds of dollars because the LifeProof Case failed to deliver on the company's guaranty.
I purchased this case with my new iPhone. Did everything as per instructional video and did the water test for two hours. Installed the phone and never opened it till yesterday. After a day on the beach, where I used the phone to take some videos and pictures returned to the hotel and discovered that the phone is not working. Carefully opened the case and discovered that there were some moisture inside and the phone is dead. I think the case is nice but it is not waterproof as advertised. It can handle a light splash of water or wet hands. But not more than that.
I took it under water and by the time I got it out of the water there was water inside the case. So now my phone won't play music throw the speaker and the home bottom sticks also it's hard to turn the phone off and on with the case on anyway. Don't buy the case! It says water proof but it's not!
I bought this case primarily for use in pools as a way to take photos underwater during family vacation. After having this case for a month, I took it into the hotel's pool for photos. When I got out of the pool, the bottom of the case had water in it. It had enough to keep my phone working but ruin the speaker so it no longer rings or makes any sound whatsoever. The mesh looking protector that covered my bottom speaker leaked water into the case and I now have to pay for a new phone since I do not have apple care. Lifeproof also does not guarantee that their product works. They also do not have anything to back their product up butnto only replace the case. What good does that do with a ruined phone!! DO NOT GET THIS CASE!!!!!
OK, based on their claims on their packaging - you can take this thing swimming, snorkeling, etc. Thats true, as long as you don't mind destroying your phone when it leaks. We bought one, and it did leak when we took it into the pool, about 6 inches underwater. (And yes, we did follow the installation instructions exactly). When we called Life Proof - they said they would guarantee just the case, and send us a new one, but wouldn't offer anything for the damage this case did to the IPhone! It cost me $200 to get the phone replaced. Their claims give you a very false sense of security. Do NOT expect this case to protect your phone!!!
I liked the case ok but don't buy this product if you think you will ever need customer support or to enforce the warranty. If you are ever able to actually get a response from customer service the procedures they put you through to file a warranty claim are outrageous. After hours of trying to file a claim I just gave up and bought a competitor's case. Needless to say, neither I nor any of my family or my associates will ever buy a product from this company again. Look elsewhere!
Great product. Well built, durable, and water tight.
After getting caught in a rainstorm outside and having to pony up $50 for a new iPhone 4s with Applecare Plus, I decided to give this case a try. It IS waterproof, and easy to put on the phone. It's expensive, and only comes with an adapter for wired headsets, and the adapter limits their functionality. Press the button to pull up Siri or answer a call? Not with the included adapter. The membrane does let some sound in while keeping water out, but you'll either have to use it with a wired or preferably a good bluetooth headset, or you'll be yelling at your handset for people to hear you. What really galls me is that despite paying $80, you still have to pay $30 for a belt clip and another $30 for a 30 pin adapter to use with your existing dock devices, or any charger than the original Apple white usb connector. So, for $140 plus tax you can also get your phone replaced three times through the applecare plus warranty. I guess their philosophy and business model is that consumers of Apple products don't mind getting price gouged for added functionality. These accessories should either be included with the case or their prices should be halved. I'd love to love this product, but with it's functionality, price and accessory pricing, I'd only recommend it if you worked as a dolphin trainer at Seaworld or stupidly didn't get the Applecare Plus warranty when you bought your phone.
My iPhone was less than 30 days old and I never drop or damage my phone. One day I removed the case for cleaning and my phone was cracked! Big cracks! All over the back. I probably dropped the phone less than 3 times and from no more than waste high. Nothing even significant I can remember. I could not believe it was cracked after all the reviews and hype. $80 and it breaks within 30 days and NO rigorous treatment. Junk. I returned it. Also, the screen is protected by a thick plastic covering which is more rubbery feeling than the otter box so you have to really press Te buttons hard to type. Totally annoying, and totally not worth it. Also, the ports for music/headphones and charging are really sealed well for waterproofing so charging is sometimes a headache and some charger won't fit. Music ports require an adapter that is included but inconvenient. Without the adapter you have to remove the case to plug headphones or aux cable in car. Stick with otter box. Don't waste your time or money.
We have one for both mine and my wife's phones. Piece of mind. I use my phone during search and rescue operations and its nice not having to worry about rain and snow. I have dropped it several times inside, on pavement and concrete with only a few scratches on the case. I have not dunked it in water, just don't see the need, but I don't worry about it getting splashed or rained on. They have one now for the ipod so my son wants one for Christmas. I am even waiting to get the iphone 5 until they come up with the case for it.
I purchased this case in Aug and in Sept the phone got wet and now my white iPhone 4S is damaged and LifeProof has refused to cover my device, all they can do is send me another case for a broken phone. My advice is DO NOT TRY TO GET THIS CASE WET, it will destroy your device and they will not replace it. Per my phone carrier they are supposed to cover my device but they won't.
This phone is an upgrade for me that was need. I am very glad that i di it. all the features are great!!
This phone sucks, you cant do half the stuff you can do on android. Apple sucks, the better choice is android.
The best phone ever don't ever need another phone.
Don't bother with a 16GB version. Other than it being overpriced as per usual with Apple products, this phone is brilliant! Does everything I need it to do and a whole bunch more things I don't need it to do! Like Angry Birds and Cut the Rope. Setting up e-mail is a breeze even manually setting up a pop3 account! Syncing/Back-up with iTunes is just super slick and user friendly. Battery life was better than I expected! What can I say, it has it all! Music, Movies, TV, Video, Pictures, Apps...
Thats all i dont have this but its great my brother has it.
The new 4s features SIRI that is very helpful when driving. It supports messaging, dialing and email responses without user looking at phone. I love this phone.
This is not a 4G phone. Apple openly states this. However, AT&T continues to say that it is a 4G device. The device is great. I would recommend that you do not get into contracts with AT&T. Thier advertisments are extremly misleading. Do your homework.
I had the iphone4 before this phone. This new phone is very cumbersome because i have to charge this phone twice a day. When i first got this phone i had to charge it all the time it seems and did not have this problem with my iphone4. This phone also has to be reset every couple of months and i have to clear out my cookies and history in my web browser because my 3G stops working. I don't know if i got a faulty phone, but this does not stack up to my iphone4. Such a rip to pay $400 for a downgrade! This phone does however have a great camera, but i expected the front camera to be better as well and i can't tell the difference. Siri is also kind of a mystery to me because there was an app for siri. The program still misunderstands me quite often and i think using it to text (while driving) is more dangerous than just texting because you have to read to make sure that siri got it right. Waste o f a program in my opinion.
You pay for what you get. The iPhone is the best smartphone on the market, bottom line. I've owned every iPhone since it's inception, not one problem with the device. 64GB is needed if you have a lot of media and things of that nature. Only thing I'd recommend is getting a case, dropped the thing 4 times. It's glass-like texture makes it really easy to slide off surfaces.
Definitely worth the upgrade from my 4.... Dual processors make a notable difference and Siri is awesome!!!
This phone is great...I can agree with some of the other reviewers about the battery life seeming short, but other than that, it's great! I've been an Apple fan for years...I had an iPhone 4 & sold it to get the 4s...in the interim, I borrowed a smart phone from a friend and found out quickly how much more user friendly the iPhone is...it's very intuitive. The other phone was extremely frustrating, I was so happy to get the 4s. Like I said, it's Apple...need I say more.
The best smartphone available, whether you want an app loaded powerful task completing, personal information manager, music/media provider and great gaming device or just a very simple phone that anyone can figure out how to use. The iPhone is your phone.
I upgraded from the iPhone 4. Was disappointed that it wasn't the iPhone 5 that we all anticipated, but once again, Apple has a hit on its hands. Siri is great. Like having a personal assistant at your disposal 24/7. I also noticed the increase in speed over the 4 and am so glad that the battery/grip of death issues have been addressed. Not to mention that the 8 MP camera and HD video have eliminated the use of my stand alone camera and video devices. Apple customer for life!
Love the speed, love everything about iPhone 4s Love how easy it is to work it or find something on it...
Best phone, I don't know why I left ! This phone works hard! Camera is excellent.
Im an Apple fan and I do love my iPhone. The only thing that is not working for me is the battery life. My previous phone lasted all day. This one I have to have a charger close.
My iPhone 4S Is the epitome of how a cell phone should operate. It has an incredible camera, the Siri is a time saver, and it is significantly faster than iPhone 4 in daily use case scenarios.
This little gem of a phone is zippy. I never have lag like I did on my 4s. No dropped calls ever in the 2 months I've had it. Don't use Siri much but I do use the speech to text recognition features within the email and text. My iphone 4 friends are insanely jealous over that feature!!
this is the only mobile phone they should sell on the entire planet. apple makes the best consumer electronics on the planet
I like the design of the phone. Apps open quickly and videos look great streaming over home WiFi. Siri is helpful for the times you are not able to type. I'm grateful for the larger memory capacity.
I have to say the the 4s is great!! i had an issue with "Siri" fading in an out in between operation. The battery life is an issue I hope will eventually be resolved. The internet browsing is pretty awesome. The camera takes great pictures. There are allot of little upgrades that were made that were bothersome in the past that make you say "cool, i hated that..." I was comtemplating buying the 16 gb model and I have to tell you that im glad i didnt, i already used up 15gb on my 64 already!! Love the Iphone 4s...
Thus far I've had great experience with the 4GS. Calls don't drop, faster speed is obvious, the voice recognition is excellent and available for most apps to use. Who says you can't text while you drive!! The photo quality is terrific. Whereas the 3GS showed me a "battery low" warning every morning, this doesn't. Really have no negatives. Plus the Best Buy purchase experience was very pleasurable.
I've owned the iP4 for 3 weeks now. I listen to it at work at least 3 hours each day. No, this is not a deep bass boom box, but it's bass is good for all types of music and it's mid-range and treble sound quality is better than many more expensive docking systems, especially when using the SRS TrueBass. The other review complains of no power. I'm not sure what the reviewer was looking for in a portable, battery powered device, but I find the music volume to be more than enough unless you plan on using it at a large, loud, party. In that case use a more powerful system designed for that type of environment. I wish the remote control would also control the othe iPod functions (menus), and I wish it had a telescoping FM antenna. Some FM presets would have been nice also. All in all I really like the sound, and I think the austere design is pretty cool. That said, iHome has the iP4 priced about $75 too high.
I bought this boombox because it caught my eye as an old-school boombox with an iPhone dock. Looked cool online, but when I got it in person I was extremely disappointed. It feels like it was made with "rubber" on the surface, it's hard to explain but it doesn't feel right for a speaker product. It also feels like it's easy to wear down. The sound for the money is frankly TERRIBLE. There is no power, and the "bass boost" simply takes you from absolutely no bass to very little bass....some boost. C batteries in a boombox nowadays should be a joke, this thing should have a rechargeable battery but it doesn't. The dock works fine, protects the device fairly nicely, and the buttons feel OK but overall I am not getting the performance I would expect for $200. Bluetooth listening would be nice at this price too! Save your money and get a portable speaker/boombox with a little more BOOM.
This is One of the best Boombox radio there is. It has that old school 80s look to it and mixed with the new school. Im 19 so i know old school and new school and this a great buy. The Volume is Great on it. After all its a Boombox its not gonna go blastin thru ur house. This is not a stereo so people stop sayin its not loud enough. If u put this in a bedroom or kitchen, the volume will fill the whole area like it was a stereo. I love this boombox to death lol. The stations are very clear like it was a Mp3 playing or something. If u like old school with good sound and feel get this one. Its Perfect
I really like this case for my iphone. I was surprised that the case has a velvety feel to it; not hard plastic feel This holster lets you face the phone in or out. The holster has a velvet lining inside for extra protection. My sister is going to get one.
This was a gift from my boyfriend. I was leaning toward the new Samsung, but I don't have 4G available in my area and won't for a while, it's huge and decided to go with this iPhone. I am very happy with my choice. I did purchase the Mophie case which is not only very protective, but nearly doubles the battery life. It is worth the money, seriously.
I upgraded from my droid which kept freezing up multiple times a day and this is such a nice change, I love it. I seriously have no complaints. I had to take the battery out of my droid at least 15 times a day to get it to unfreeze especially when trying to end phone calls. Working with Best Buy was a lot easier than working with VZW, since all VZW wants to do is push the 4G droids. Another plus is that I can actually hear phone conversations, unlike the droid where I had to say what ALL the time.
I had the droid and this is must better and faster, easy to use
I can't give enough Kudo's to this phone...everything about it is great. So far, I have no complaints. I'm learning new things on it every day. I guess there is one complaint...I can't send emails out, but I think that's because of CenturyLink...I keep forgetting to contact them about this! Otherwise, I am thoroughly satisfied!
My first iPhone. Loving it! Easy to use. I text much better on this phone than any other ooh one I've had.
I got this on mothers day for my wife. She loves it and it makes perfect sense for her because she has the ipad and ipod. It synced perfectly with the apps she already bought. She uses it a lot which is probably why battery life is poor and it is constantly buzzing/chiming with updates and notices. I know this can be adjusted, but it's not a big deal to plug in for her at home or in the car She charges about 1 -2 times a day depending on use. Otherwise the phone works great and I get a kick out of Siri.
i rec'd this in the middle of May.it has never held a charge. I have to be inconvenienced and go back to the store. even if i use the mophie it takes hours and hours to regain cell life. too funny all the verizon reps say are your apps on? lights dim.. yes..nothing is on. Siri - isnt all that. i rarely use her. she does not understand much. TV makes it much more user friendly. if you call verizon about the iphone they tell you to call apple. you call apple and its a verizon problem. i am seriously disgruntled. the phone is very fragile too, of course i have it in a case.
Great phone. Can do everything from phone, camera, entertainment , tv and personal computer.
The product just works. It synced up with all my info in a snap. Love it. Really wanted the 32 gb version, but best buy doesn't carry it, or at least that was what the clerk told me at the store. I get two days out of a charge.
First time smart phone and I am very impressed. I get why everywhere you look people have the iPhone. It is the best. Don't waste your time with any other phone and get the best.
after a few short months the battery only last 4 hours on stand by bought the morphie extra battery case can barely get through the day.
I like the phone but there is so much to it and I got absolutely no instructions on how to use it. I'm sure it does so much more than I have figured out! The keypad is small and I often hit the wrong letter when texting. The auto-correct loves to change the words I am trying to type and that is very frustrating! Although I am some what disappointed in the ease of learning to use my new IPhone 4S, I do like it and I look forward to figuring out all its capabilities.
Upgraded from the iPhone4 to the iPhone 4s after dropping and breaking the 4. (It was upgrade time anyway). Came to Best Buy and was able to trade in my old phone and get my new one for far less than Verizon Wireless charges to upgrade. The sales staff was knowledgeable and taught me things about the phone that I did not know. The 4s is worth the upgrade for Siri alone. When driving, having Siri send messages or find directions is phenomenal. The camera on this phone takes better pictures than my Canon Powershot digital camera. I'm totally sold on anything Apple after having this phone (and my MacBook Pro)!
Love this phone, very easy to operate immediately upon purchase. The battery life is not that great and I have to keep the charger with me all the time. Also very disappointing that this phone was not eligible for the double data deal due to not being a 4G phone.
This is a fun phone and has so many new features that there will be a longer learning curve for those of us with fewer skills. I am still learning, but it is truly a magic device! Yes, by the time I am proficient there will be a newer device. Too bad! I'll just enjoy this one I have now for some time!
Apple should have put a larger capacity battery and a micro SD card slot.
I have had so many phones in the last 15yrs, and this is the best sounding phone for calls. I traded in an android phone for the 4s. I really love this phone. Now I know why so many iPhones have been sold.
Nice phone but you would think that since Apple updated to the 4S they would have a lot more features than Siri. A little disappointed that I spent the money to upgrade from my original 4 for the little difference.
Going back to a droid. The phone works fine but I am not a fan of the email. I prefer the touchdown app therefor I am going back to droid.
Battery life is good. Lasts me all day. Even playing games. Screen colors are crisp. I have no complaints about this phone. I came out of a Droid and am glad I made the switch!
I got this phone for one reason: the wife wanted it. Now, I'll be the first to tell you she had determined this in the space of 20 minutes playing with the store phones. Tried this phone for 15 minutes, and then the next phone for 5 minutes before switching back. iPhone in hand on the way out the store, it has seen more use than the old phone. Apps have made it more than a phone: it's communication central. She has used all features than you would expect, and not looked back.
At first I hated this iPhone - I couldn't get Siri to recognize anything I said and she just wouldn't do what I wanted her to. It is getting easier. I'm not sure the phone was worth $200, but it is fun to play games on...
I like it because I can video someone when I talk to them
I have had my iPhone for several weeks now, and I still haven't even used it to it's full potential and I LOVE it. It runs so smoothly. The ONLY complaint I have is that my email doesn't automatically update. I have to go into it before it refreshes and downloads new emails. That aside, this is a great phone. I am not one to spend a lot of money on a cell phone, but I was sick of the LGs and Samsungs - even if I took the best care of them, they had issues between 3-9 months. I was skeptical about this phone because I like to have a keyboard, but I have found texting on this phone to be just as easy. Telling Siri to remind you of things is the best feature. I work 2 jobs and am in graduate school, so I have a lot to remember and Siri helps me out. The photos it takes are also fantastic!! I love my iPhone and highly recommend it. (I also recommend getting your phone through Best Buy, of course. Their insurance plan is by far superior and they have great customer service!)
Very happy with this phone. All the apps I could want and very easy to use.
Everyone seems to have this phone.Of course the one I got was a flunky..Speakers went and the phone had to be replaced.I have only had it 2 weeks.My wife wants to get one but I dont know....Thank God I purchased the protection plan is all I can say. another person was at the store exchanging for the same problems....
Had the razr for a week and hated it. It kept having glitches. Switched and love the iPhone. If you've ever had an iPod touch you'll love the iPhone. Battery life is good if you don't have Push for every app.
I love this phone, it has everything I could possibly want for personal use. Easy to use, fun to play with, everything is at your fingertips.
Faster for everything and god for music and games app olso luck good in whith
I will never go back to any other phone! Great purchase!
Bought the 4S for my wife, next week have to take it back, head phone jack only plays out one side, I've swtiched three sets of headphone and it does it on all of them, other than they wife seems to enjoy the phone. Will see if it can be fixed or trade out
Our family has ipods, ipads, and now 2 iphones. We switched from droids because they were overall terrible and EXTREMLY slow! We are now in love with our phones and love being able to synch everything. The cloud is wonderful for pictures, too. We never have to worry about losing any, and we can always access our favorite music.
I love the phone. The negative is don't let Best Buy associates hook you up with a phone plan. I wanted to go onto my husband's plan and was told I would only be paying 30.00 data plan for me. Went to Verizon a month later and they said my plan was ridiculous. Best Buy associate put my on family plan with my husband but he had unlimited and they made my plan unlimited so both of us paid double. I wil NEVER use Best Buy again for phone plans. Best Buy cost me quite a bit of extra money! So I recommend the phone, but not Best Buy.
I held out for a long time thinking I wouldn't use the features of this phone enough to make it worth the expense. Boy was I wrong . I may not actually need to have all these features, but I love the access to the internet, the camera, and the email access. I will never be without it again.
This is my first smart phone. It's pretty easy to use and I love the apps. Tried a Droid for a few days but it was to confusing so back it went to Verizon and I went to Best Buy where they didn't try to get me to buy what they wanted. My only problems are Siri doesn't always understand what I say and the keyboard it hard at first to get used to but the positives definitely outway the negatives. Would also recommend getting a protective cover for the front screen. Makes taking care of it much easier.
I was one who was never going to go from a basic phone to a smartphone because I just didn't think the additional expense was worth it, that I wouldn't use it very much. Oh, my, Goodness, was I wrong. This phone is just perfect. It is so absolutely intuitive and easy to use. I've tried so many things without formally planning ahead to do them. I would be in the middle of something and just keep right on going. For example, I was reading a text from someone who had forwarded the phone number of someone else. On any other phone I would have thought, "Ok, get something to write this number down...", but I did't even think about it, I touched the phone number string of text in the text message and a "Copy" option popped up. So I open up the Contacts and created a new one. For the phone number, I pressed my finger to the screen again until "Paste" showed up and touched Paste. That was it. But the point is, I didn't think have to think ahead to do that or while I was doing it, I just did it because the phone makes things so natural.
This is the best phone purchase I have ever made. I know that it is more than a phone, you have a mini computer in the palm of your hands. This phone does everything I want and more. The more I use this phone the more I like it. I don't know why I did not purchase an iPhone sooner. The only thing I wish was different is the battery life, but if that is the only down fall, I can live with that.
I've had the 4s for a month now and I have no complaints. Next to friends phone with bigger screens the iphone is still so much clearer. I love that the phone is not huge, but very clear to read and navigate. The only negative part sometime is the non supported flash for some videos. I'm not super techy but I can get around as needed for other electronics just fine, but the iphone is just easy. I never had an android phone, but I had an android tablet that lasted in my household for 3 weeks and I returned it for an ipad 2, which the reason I went iphone.
Works much faster than my old 3g phone. The rep at Best Buy was great and very helpful
I love my Iphone 4S, its a great phone, best phone on the market. i had a blackberry curve and it operating system is slow as f***. at first i thought it was just the 3G thing since the 4G came out. But on my Iphone 4S, its super fast no matter where i am.
I wouldn't choose any other phone. This phone pretty much does everything that you need and let me tell you that once you have this phone you are addicted to it you wouldn't know what to do without it. It makes androids look dumb and I hate androids and would never own one. So over all this phone is a 9 out of 10 the battery could be a little better. But other then that it's supper fast.
This phone is definately scary to invest in because of the price but it is well worth it. Verizon kept giving me cheap broken phones and wouldn't help me at all. When I went into Best Buy to just buy a phone out right they didn't push me to the most expensive phone. They should me a phone that was perfect for me. This phone has no problems so far. Its perfect. The 4s is definately faster than the 4 but still pretty much the same phone. Love it! and never giving it up.
Good luck asking her that, she will turn you down. I love my iphone 4s, i have it in white, i just think the black is more masculine. I Have over 800 songs from i tunes on my phone as well as a few hundred pictures and it has a ton of more space on it. the screens are easy to move around, the internet is quick. i dont even have to type out my texts any more siri does it for me! i also love that when i dont know a phone number i tell siri to call the best buy in dekalb and it finds the number for me! i love the forward facing camera and facetime is pretty cool too. its not as customizable as i would of liked, but personally in my opinion, this is the best phone on the market!!!! I Love and i would never give it back!!
I have enjoyed having the iphone 4s. You can do so much with this phone. I like having the flexibility to make calls, take pictures, read mail and surf the web no matter where you are.
I've wanted an iPhone for the longest time and after killing my Droid I figured "What the heck". And I'm so glad I changed to the iPhone! This is the most amazing phone yet and it does everything I need it to,and more! It's incredibly easy to text & navigate. The apps are endless (as everyone knows). Not to mention, the camera is amazing for a phone! I used it at a concert and got crystal clear pictures from 16 rows back. I did have a problem with the battery life at first. After tweaking a few settings (gps, wi-fi, etc.) I don't run into any problems with it (battery lift) anymore. It lasts me almost 2 days before needing to be charged. Also, it charges wicked fast. I'm used to charging my old 20g iPod classic and it took hours to charge. The iPhone takes less than an hour to fully charge.
Bought for everyone during the holidays 3 total. The product works well no problems so far. Hard to find, Best Buy was only place i could find so i drove 90 miles to get. They set up everything before i left so i did not do anything which was great. Camera works well and streaming works well good picture. Would buy again but get a Otterbox case to protect expensive and fragile.
I love my iPhone 4s. It has so many great features. Siri is awesome it comes in really handy. The cameras take great pics and videos. Its an overall wonderful phone.
Great phone love iOS 5 and cloud integrated into iPhone . Had android phones (droid Eris, droid x, Samsung fas.) no were near the quality of this phone
Made the switch from my Droid Incredible and I'm thoroughly loving my 4s. Siri is a little dissappointing, but overall the phone is great. iOS and the hardware throttle anything that Android can deliver.
I love this phone. This is the best phone I have ever had and I thought my i-pod touch was great. The phone has so many more features. You can get so many different apps and most are cheap or free. It takes great pictures, games, puzzles, music, video's and so much more.....
I love my iphone, great internet and web access. Seri is very cool, and the speaker on the phone is great.
great service and customer at the Bloomington Indiana Mobile store in the mall. The phone is more than it was touted to be. Siri is a great "tool" to have and the battery life is supberb!!!
I purchased the iphone 4S in white about a month ago and I love everything about it. Its easy to use and has many features. Your firends will have phone envy!! I almost never use my laptop since gettig this phone. Its a mini computer. I used to have blackberry phones and got used to the touch typing in a hour.
I wasn't sure I'd like the iPhone after being a blackberry user for years. I thought I might be slowed down texting & sending email with the touch screen vs. the keyboard. The features on the iPhone 4S soon made me forget about my Blackberry. I use for both work and personal use so I like that I can access contacts, calendars & email to help keep me orgainized. The phone works well for me, I've had no issues with dropped calls. The camera takes great pictures and I love having all my music, pictures, calendar all available on my phone. Internet searching is much more functional on the iphone than I ever experienced on my Blackberry. Siri the electronic assistant is both fun and functional once you get the hang of how to speak to her, it's great for searching the internet or voice activated dialing.
Great phone. The apps are great. Camera takes awesome pics.I love having conversations with Siri ( yes I'm a teenager). The only thing is that she sometimes doesn't understand what I'm saying and gives incorrect informaton. The bad thing is the battery, it doesn't last very long if you're using apps and the phone frequently. I hope they can fix this at some point with a system upgrade.
Everything I wanted and expected, best purchase of 2011!
Best phone ever! I will never go to android again.
I love this phone. It is my first smartphone so I'm unfamiliar with how they work but this one really is so easy to use. Love the look too! My daughter dropped it on the hardwood floor and the hard case chipped. Recommend a using a case. It was easy to replace.
Great phone...of course. Easy to use and great looking.
Was time to upgrade my phone, and most my friends and family have Iphones, so I said why not. As far as the phone goes it is everything I expeted it to be. Easy to use, fun, Siri is a bit of a joke but can be entertaining. The camera's on this phone are flat out amazing for a flipping phone. My contract pricing was aviable and I had some gift cards, and this is my only issue with the phone was Best buy. The rep who were taking care of me did not know what to do, she kept asking for help, and got none from her co wokers. During the processes she actually deavtivated my wife's phone and almost terminated my contract. I ended up having to go back to the store to return the phone and rebuy it to use my gift cards, again due to the rep not knowing what to do. quick summery, phone good, best buy phone reps, garbage
I love this phone. The apps and extras are well worth the time it took to figure out how to use it. My only frustration is with the texting. It is impossible to put the cursor in between two letters to change a letter which would be useful since it frequently changes words I spelled correctly to a different word. When telling my husband I love him it changed it to I live you. It does this frequently. Other than that I love this phone. My fav so far.
i was always an adroid user but them i stopped using all the features that you get with android like the multi screens and all that other stuff.so i decided that since i was going to verizon i might as well try the iphone.and i have to say that i am very impressed.the user interface is good for me i hated ios 4 cause the notification system was awful.but ios 5 is way better even tho it is just android redifined.i love itunes and siri is awsome i love to use it while im driving so i never have to touch my phone.overall this is a good phone but it jsut depends on what kinda person u r rather u will like it or not
The phone was not available at any stores within 17 miles except for the Glendora and Riverside stores. I chose Glendora. The reviews of this store being a nightmare are true! I didn't believe it until yesterday. I ordered the iphone online, paid for it, etc... then, received notification that is was ready to be picked up. I checked my online banking and the money was already processed. Ok, the whole process of picking up my phone from start to finish was exceedingly and excruciatingly long. I got there around 3:30 and left at 5:00. Also, the mobile employee didn't care that he was entering my information from my drivers license incorrectly, the spelling of my name, birth date etc... I even told him, but he's like it doesn't matter. It matters to me! They were not even going to call corporate to get help with my problem but when they finally did, the corporate employee handled it and I was finally able to leave the store. The exact problem was that their computer system wouldn't let them "pick" my order and close it out. Geek Squad, where are you?!
I absolutely love my new Iphone 4s! I just upgraded from Lg EnV touch. It was horrible. I decided to not get a droid, from what I heard they are horrible. Then i turned to the Iphone, I was sketchy about it. I have the tendancy to drop my phone. Since the Iphone is glass, I was worried. But if you just get a case you should be ok. I highly recomend the OtterBox phone cases.
I went from a Samsung not-smart phone to the iPhone and used Gift Cards to pay for it! I stayed with Verizon. I found the iPhone 4S to be much more sensitive, i.e., gives me more bars almost everywhere than my Samsung. The voice quality is excellent. As far as the apps, they are a pleasure to use either on 3G or WiFi. It delivers the expected Apple Experience, It Just Works! I used the Pre-order and had my iPhone on Bay 1! I stood in no lines and was activated and out the door in under an hour, despite the slowness of the systems of Verizon and Best Buy on one their record-setting traffic days. I highly recommend both the iPhone 4S and Best Buy!
Great phone! I can't believe that it is not 4G. That is the only downside which is a big one for me.
I'm glad that i returned Samsung-Droid charge & got my 1st iphone. Eventhough i had to waite about 2 1/2 weeks but it was worth it. i just wish Apple could offer more color choices for the iphone.
I love my phone and would buy another. The only problem is that in order to protect it from damage I had to give up the slim line and go bulky.
This is my first Iphone. I love the Siri; and am very pleased with the phone.
With all the features it has I went on a trip without taking my computer. I didn't need it. Just the phone!
This is my first smartphone. I have had it for 5 days and I will be returning in when I get home, possibly in many pieces. It will not hold a phone call for more than 30 seconds. You cannot hear it ring or feel it vibrate. I have spent over 5 hours trying to set up a personal ringtone, unsucsessful. I would think that a company that is growing as rapidly as Apple would have user friendly devices. This thing is the biggest piece of junk I have ever seen. I would not recommend this to anybody, even if it was free.
This phone is AMAZING! To me it is the best apple product. If your thinking about getting the iPhone 5 DON'T! They did NOT raise the battery life, and the screen is as big as the iPhone 4. So the battery life will really suck! But seriously the iPhone 4 and iPhone 4s are the best Apple iPhone products. So if you are thinking about getting an iPhone get either one of the iPhone 4 or the iPhone 4s. THEY ARE THE BEST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I would highly recommend this phone. The learning curve is easy. Much easier than most of the other phones on the market. Suri is great and I am amazed at the technology that goes into her responses and how you can ask her almost anything and get an answer.
The iPhone 4S is a great phone, the a5 chip is fast, I love the Siri feature the battery life is great, the iPhone 4S on Verizon is the best.
The phone is very well made. You can see and feel the quality in the phone. The OS not very innovating. This is my wife's phone and she is not very technical so this phone is great for people with low tech skills. It does the job for her but my Galaxy S III runs circles around it when it comes to features, power, speed and camera. Over all the phone is a good phone.
I never intended to get an iphone, but I wanted to be able to text occasionally. This phone is great for my purposes.
The phone is technologically wonderful and easy to use. It has many wonderful features. The screen is horrible. Very easy to break!!
I love my new iphone 4s. This is my first smart phone and found it to be really easy to use and find all the features. Love being able to facetime with my kid in college.
Even if I wasn't such a fan of Apple's product line, I would be thrilled with this particular Smart Phone. The iPhone 4s succeeds in a variety of ways. It fits comfortably in my hand. The color display is resilient with colors that capture the natural tones. Some others attempt to recreate the colors, but inevitably approximate them. Sound quality is exceptional. The voices that emerge from phone calls sound as if they are right by my side, close at hand. Even though I have large hands, texting is relatively easy and a relief after using other brands for way too long. Syncing with my MacBook Pro is easy and highly customizable. I don't mind taking my time to get the iPhone 5. I've seen it. It's great, but I am content for a little while longer!
IF U PEOPLE WANT THE BEST PHONE IN THE WORLD GET THIS ONE ITS AWESOME! YOULL FALL IN LOVE WITH IT!
I had a EVO - I thought that was the greatest thing - but it can't compare to this phone. The 4S was easy to set up, easy to start using, and it sooooooo has become the new Favorite Phone Ever!!! The aps are easy to get - the fact that it doesn't limit you to only 4 or 5 screens is wonderful - I love the texting - you on one side of the screen - the textee on the other half. I wish they had a free voice GPS as I use this feature a great deal. That is the only thing so far that I have found I would change - I have had this phone for about 6 weeks now.
The IPhone does it all! I use the calendar to remind me of the whole families schedule, check emails, go online & it's a great phone to. Siri is great& funny too!
It's exactly what I expected, it's easy to use, very nice, great features, light, it gives you a lot of options for different things. One thing I don't care for is that you can't send more than one photo in an email, and you can't attach photos or files to an email, you have to go to the photo or file's options and send it from there directly.
You can't really go wrong with any iPhone.. Love the ease of this phone...
I would highly recommend! Have wanted one for a long time and I got the chance to get one!
works great on Sprint, I reccomend the 32gb it seems to have enough storeage with alot of apps and movies, icloud with itunes matchh is also a great feature
The apple i4s is a good phone, easy to use for most basic functions. The manual is a bit much, would be nice to have a short phone cheatsheet. For example if the phone is ringing and you don't want to answer, it does not give you the option to ignore (hit the power button) on screeen.
I've never had an Iphone but this 4S is great.easy to use and understand the Apps........
Going from an android phone to the Iphone is a big let down. The android phones allow you to do so much more with your phone. The only thing I like better about the Iphone is the battery life. The phone interface is poor, The fact that all installed programs must have icons on the home screens. Each home screen is top left justified so you cannot choose where to keep the icons. I like to put icons near the bottom of the screen for easy thumb reach for one had operation.
Im warming up to this phone, but I miss my android. I found my HTC EVO Shift to be more user-friendly than this one. Just something I have to get used to. Battery life isn't great, but I guess most smart phones are in the same boat. SIRI doesn't live up to the hype yet. I also really miss 4G. This phone is painfully slow. Awesome camera though. I just wish I could upload directly to Facebook from camera roll. The bottom line is that for things I use the phone for most, android made it easier for me. Again, I hope to warm up to it, but at this point, still a regrettable purchase.
My only complaint about the iPhone 4S is that you have to search for the owner's manual to learn about stuff, and I learned more from other users than I was able to learn from the manual.
I love my iphone! It is so much faster and user friendly than my Epic phone! Dosn't lock up or freeze on me either! Has more features!
I have never owned an iPhone before this phone so I am new to all aspects of this phone. Needless to say I was very hyped up to buy this phone. Coming from using Microsoft, BlackBerry and Android OS, this interface seems very simplified compared to all three, although reminds me a lot of Android. The display is very vivid and very responsive to touch, this phone has never frozen or caused me any trouble. Everything is easy to sync, iTunes and iCloud make a lot of worry about loosing potential data go away. Thousands of apps to choose from and limitless amounts of music. Honestly I can find nothing wrong with this phone at all. Data is fast (for 3G), amazing camera, vivid screen, very user friendly, good battery life (for a smart phone), and over all feels very well built. Everyone has their different likings and dislikings when it comes to smart phones, every smart phone has it's pros and cons, where this phone might lack the security of BlackBerry or customization of Andriod, it makes up for it with simple interface, ease to sync, and fun over all. I have had many different types of smart phones over the years and with this phone I was looking for an easy to use phone that will not cause me any trouble, and that is exactly what I got.
I love this phone. I can store all my music, movies and apps.
I had a Blackberry before the 4S, this is my first iPhone, and I have to say I absolutely love it. I really haven't found anything that I can't do with this phone. You might as well forget about surfing the internet on you Blackberry. I don't think that the Blackberry's are really built for that, but the iPhone handles this task with ease. It seems like I learn a new cool feature every week. I love how you can control your email folders with the iPhone and keep everything organized. It's amazing to be able to put my iTunes on my phone as well, considering I have over 35gb of music in my iTunes. The only thing that is a slight draw back is that on my Blackberry when my email would come through to my inbox it instantly showed up on my phone, or it was pushed to my phone. I cannot get my Gmail accounts to push to my iPhone. I'm not sure if it is the Sprint network, iPhone, or Gmail itself that is causing this but it's the only downfall. That's the only downfall to me but it's not that serious and I will live with it for everything else that you get with this phone.
Having been with an android phone for a while now, I switched to the iPhone 4S. The iPhone completely overshadows the android phone in ALMOST every fashion. Its faster, longer battery life after the iOS update, there is an immense amount of apps, the screen is even better than the SUPER AMOLED that I had with the EPIC 4G, the camera is better, and basically it is an entirely better product. With that said, there is only one thing that the androids have gotten right. They have free navigation, even though most of the time my navigation was screwy on the android. In any case, if you are having doubts about jumping on the iPhone bandwagon, don't.
I really like the Siri feature it makes checking messages and finding information easier. The camera is easy to use and makes great pictures. Web browsing is also simple and very fast. Lots of features and of course apps!
i hope i dont know the latest one feathers but i am sure that apple is very great company always they are thinking abt customers reqired obtions i am just waiting to buy thx
this phone is ungodly! smooth, quick, easy to use. i should have left droid long ago!
Very disappointed. Only had this for 2 weeks and the paint was chipping off. Paint flakes everywhere. Spend the extra $5 and don't get this product.
It breaks easy, chips and doesn't really provide protection, feels like I waisted money, I do not recommend this product
I travel a lot and have the mophie key chain dongle charger which has worked flawlessly for me the past 3 months. Was excited for this when I picked it up last week, this week however it doesn't hold any kind of charge. Did some searching around and wasn't hard to find similar stories. I loved it when it did work. But honestly you're better off getting a mophie boost for half price and same amount of power. Maybe you might have better luck than me. If you require to charge your phone in your pocket, take a gamble with this. Otherwise go with the less pricy mophie products that aren't cases they will be more reliable, cheaper and easier to replace in the long run.
This is a great product. It is extremely useful and almost eliminates the need to bring a charger with you when out for an entire day. The case is very durable and strong. I suspect if the phone was dropped (anywhere but ON the screen) it would be protected and not be damaged. The only bad thing about this product that I have found thus far is that at night (outside) when taking pictures, due to the case, the flash cannot project out the way it was designed to. This creates a picture that is brighter on the left side. This is because the case is very thick and the flash is partly blocked by the case. Of course, there is a wide space for the flash and photo lens to take pictures but the case still creates an eliptal shape over the left 1/4 of the picture. There is no way to compensate for this issue. For this reason the product gets a 4.
If you do not have access to a phone charger, this is the product for you.
My boyfriend has been bragging about the power of Mophie for about 6 months. I finally broke and just bought this case. Now I see why he thinks Mophie is so amazing. Sometimes I forget to plug my iPhone in overnight or I just don't have time. Well, this just saved my life. A whole extra charge in just a flick of a switch. The case has lights on the bottom that indicate how much battery life is left in the case and I have the control when to tell my phone it can charge off my case. The case has a sweet design including a micro USB that I can sync and charge my iPhone with. Great job Mophie, now make an iPad case like this.
Outstanding. More than doubles the life of the iPhone battery which is what I wanted. Will not exhaust during even a busy day.
I love this case, I no longer have to worry about battery when using my Iphone. I'm free to use it however I want because I know I'll have enough battery. Some people think it's a little big or heavy but I don't think so, it actually fits better in my hand. The sound redirection works well and so do the push through buttons. My only complaint is that it's expensive! But it's worth it!
This is great. I needed it for a class I was attending where I would not be able to charge my phone. This extended my time use by more than double.
I've had the Mophie for about 8 months. It fits the phone very well, and stays on relatively well, although if you grab it from your pocket by the top cover, the top cover will slip off. The cover has held up relatively well, still looks good after 8 months, and offers good protection. It takes several hours to recharge from dead, but this is easy enough to do from a car charger or overnight. Be warned though, charging in a dark room at night the LED's are super bright, so make plans to cover it up if you don't sleep well with flashing bright lights. The biggest issue I've had with mine is that the cable connection on the phone basically separated from the case and receded back into the case. This made it impossible to connect the charge cable and bricked the phone. Contacting Mophie they require a receipt, which I didn't have after 8 months so adios $99 phone case. I would recommend the case but save your receipt and be aware of questionable build quality. Further, because the location of the charging cable is off to the side of the case, it's awkward when using the phone while it is charging. Bottom line is its a decent product which could be made better with a little more engineering.
I was using the Powermat product for over a year before I tried the Mophie Juice Pack. Wow! What a great addition to my iPhone.
I use my phone for business, ALL day. This will allow me to use the phone and not worry about being plugged into a wall anytime during the day. It is a bit bulky, so I usually keep this in my purse and have a different slim cover on it. And, when I need to charge I put the phone into this case and I'm good to keep working. I moved to an iPhone from an Android, so all my car home chargers use micro-USB sockets. This takes that to charge, so I didn't need to replace any of my existing chargers. For me, that was a bonus.
I had been using the Mophie JuicePack Air for a couple of weeks and wanted to try the JuicePack Plus. It is overall a nicer case in many ways. Not only does it have the longer battery life, it has better texture and actual buttons for the volume and sleep instead of just cut-outs. Plus the black doesn't show scratches as easy the silver JuicePack Plus. Some people are put off by the price but its worth every penny in the end.
if your like me and have to have every apple device protected by zagg screen protectors fear no more !!! your search is finally over. before i continue telling you how awesome this case is and how amazing it looks i need to first tell you that i also purchased a Mophie juice pack air....its not nearly as good as the juice pack plus it just doesn't compare in looks and practicality. The upgrade cost to the juice pack plus is def worth it and you wont regret it. So to the point no case was compatibility with the zagg screen protector but this case on top of looks and just the way it feels in your hand ( although a little heavy ) is just amazing. by far this is the best looking case Ive ever purchased not like the ugly and bulky otter box that's a paper weight on my desk now. again its a tiny heavy but after a while you dont even notice. the extra battery on this thing is awesome ive seen it charge my phone to 100% from 1% so i dont have to charge as often.
This really helps when you have a long day and your battery is going down quickly - just flip a switch and it starts going up immediately!
I have had my iPhone 4S for about 4-1/2 months and it's at the point where one charge will not make it thought the day and I find it annoying which is why I bought this case. I am very happy with everything except the price. They could have put a protective layer over the rear camera. But it works well. When you switch it on the iPhone thinks it's plugged in.
I use this case on a daily basis. The 2000mAh battery is more than enough to get my iPhone through a long, busy day. I love that you can choose whether or not to use the battery via a small switch on the side. I love that I can charge both the phone and the case battery AND sync my phone with a standard micro USB cable. It has been durable and, while it does add a fair amount of bulk to the phone, it is not excessive. The only thing that I didn't like was the inability to turn off the lights on the bottom when charging. I had to put some electrical tape on the bottom of the case so I could sleep at night.
Been looking for a battery back up. Great idea. Especially when I use my I phone all day. I just switch it to the 1500 mah. The only isssue I have with it is the volume and power button wells is to deep. If you have large hands I would not recommend it. But beside I like it a lot. Very sturdy.
I pick up this item up recently on a business trip. I have to say its great. I get more then 1 full day of use out of it. I am a power user and find it really gets me through a full day of use. (a must have for cross country flight with long layovers) Pros: Makes the iphone compatible with a a micro usb for both a sync and a charge. Cons: makes the phone just too big for any case other then the Mophie case...not a big deal but if you like to use a clip limits your options. I will get one for my wife when she upgrades to the Iphone 4S soon....
I purchased my Mophie Juice Pack Plus Case for my iPhone 4s back in November 2011. The only complaint I can offer is that the battery case increases the overall dimensions of the phone such that it is nearly impossible to find a holster or slip case that fits. The problem is mainly with the increased length (just over 5 inches). I finally went with Mophie's own model 7000 holster case. That works but itself is uncomfortably bulky. Other than that issue, I have been satisfied with the battery case. It performs pretty much as advertised and charges the iPhone fairly fast. My habit is to use the iPhone's own battery until it drops to ~ 15% capacity, then turn on the Mophie battery. I like this strategy because it allows me to drain the iPhone's internal battery more completely before I recharge it (which I've read is good for maintain the longevity of the iPhone battery). The Mophie battery essentially serves as my "insurance" that my iPhone will not run out of "juice" if I use it hard during the day. I've read others who complain about the increased bulk and weight that the Mophie adds to the iPhone. There is no question this is true, but I personally like the increased heft to the iPhone that it provides. I also like the non-slip feel of the case itself. I've also read others who complain about the durability or lack thereof of the Mophie's micro-USB connector. I have had no problems yet with that connector and I am either syncing or recharging through that connector almost every day. I agree that the location of the connector in the lower right side of the case perhaps makes it prone to abuse because the USB cable sticks out at a right angle to the case. However, it you simply get used to that fact, you quickly develop a habit of being careful when connecting it to the cable. I migrated from a Blackberry that used the same micro-USB cable and it was nice to still be able to use my travel charger from that phone. However, because I do not want to remove the phone from the case very often, I feel "left out" that I cannot consider using any accessory that requires the native iPhone connector. I've not tried any other battery case, so cannot compare it to any others. However, overall, I am satisfied with this one.
This is great for providing extended battery life for playing games and running other apps on your iPhone 4 or 4s. Forgot to charge your phone? Not a problem. You can charge your phone from the battery in the caseThe rugged case also provides excellent protection for the exterior of your phone protecting it from accidental drops or other conditions.
I recieved this product for my birthday this year. It is a very useful case and I probably couldn't see myself with out it ever again. It is amazing that I can drain my battery all the way the charge it all the way back up. I absolutely love this product and would definately fork $100 for it any day.
I bought this because I constantly use my phone at work and can't always charge it. At first, I disliked how heavy and bulky it made the device. I took the case off and said I was going to return it the next day. After continuing to use my iPhone at work without the case my phone ended up dying. I put the case back on and told myself that I would give it a week and see if I could stand it. Needless to say, I love it now. Yes it's bulky, but it fits better in your hand. It just takes some getting use to. I absolutely love my Mophie and the extended battery life!
I was close to paying $50 for an Otterbox, when I came across this case/battery solution for $100. Yes, it makes the phone twice as thick, but it fits my hand better and gives me double the battery life. I cannot complain. I'm still able to fit it in my front jean pocket, so not sure what everyone else is talking about. I was disappointed when I got my iPhone and realize that it only lasts one day, which is 3 times less than my old iPhone. This is the perfect all-in-one solution. Not sure how people can expect to have a sleek design, and have a 2000mah battery in the case. They made it as sleek as possible. If you want longer battery life, this is the best solution. If you don't want the bulkiness, then you can buy an external battery to charge it. I like how you can switch the battery on and off. Also, it uses a microUSB, which is easier to come by than a stupid 30-pin Apple adapter.
This is the worst thing I have ever bought. It is so bulky and heavy that I can't carry it in my pocket. I also had to pry it off my phone the first time a used it. Do not buy this.
My battery has been draining like crazy so I got this to help me not to have to have the phone plugged in so much during the day. I like the idea, but the thing is so bulky and heavy. It makes the phone substantially heavier and bigger. The cord placement is horrible when charging is you want to try and use your phone while it is charging. Also, the blinking LED during charging is obnoxious in darker environments. Oh, and it uses some kinda micro USB type connection at the phone, rather than Apple's cord, which I already have three of and would love to use those instead.
It is very useful if you are on the go and away from a charger often. With this particular model you can charge a completely dead phone, with one full charge from the case. In other words if the case is at 100% and the phone is at 0%, you can charge phone fully to 100% once. So its good for one full charge or several "top-offs." In the literature that comes with the case it does say that it is only good for 500 complete cycles. I guess that equates to a rather long time...depending on your particular usage. It does easily allow you to charge cycle (run phone batteries all the way to 0%, then charge to 100%, this conditions batteries to last longer) your iPhone though which is good. Case is sleek in appearance, however it is bulky but that's to be expected. Seems durable although I have never dropped it. Easy to get phone in and out for docking and other connections. Overall I would/have recommend this product to others, its worth the money, especially if you can find it on sale somewhere.
very easy to take iphone out and good battery life
I purchased this item with great expectatiion this morning and returned it the same afternoon. I wasn't to disappointed with the sturdiness, handling (nice grip).. but was stunned to see that with all the effort to make a decent product that fits every miillimeter of the iphone 4 to a tee, Mophie failed to construct a adequate locking mechanism that would securly hold the phone in place. The back dimple lock just doesn't cut it! If you lift the phone by the top (the only option from a stand up case) and it's loose just a little; when you lift it up it could potentially drop out ** bye Iphone! That's my experience for the few hours I had it....!
This thing is great I am a Verizon Iphone4 user and it works very well with my phone. It takes a couple hours to fully charge but its well worth it. Its pretty much like having a extra charger for on the go. Thank you Mophie.
Previously had a battery case from New Trent for $40. The battery worked great, but the case was cheaply made and broke easily. Stepped up and paid the extra dollars for the Mophie ($100) and have to say it was worth it. It works great, although the battery doesn't provide quite as much power as the New Trent did. The case itself is much more solidly constructed, and I expect it to last a long time.
I am usually not one to judge products, but i have had the worst experience with this item. I bought it when i went on vacation to New York, and it worked great for 2 weeks, then i constantly get a message on screen indicating that charging is not supported with this accessory. I have made the complaint and also called Customer Service but got no help what so ever. I am sure this item works for some people but for me, it was a complete waste of money.
Great look, sleek, not bulky and it comes in black. It's a great investment.
I am on my second Morphie. On my first Morphie, the microUSB port came loose and fell out after 2 months of use. My second Morphie I have had for 5 months. I thought is wasn't charging because something was wrong with the USB cable. After further inspection, the microUSB port is not working...again. It is loose and no cable will work with it. I even bought new cables thinking that was the issue. Unless you are willing to shell out $100 every 3-5 months, I would not recommend this product. The company says in the instruction manual that they will not handle nor fix these type of issues. I recommend looking at other battery cases now.
The only thing I got this because my wifes a puma fan.lol still made of cheap plastic could got a better deal on eBay but if the wifes happy I'm happy:)
I applied it in about two minutes, and no dust is under the protector. This is a first for me. Maybe I was just lucky this time, but all other stick-on protectors I have tried immediately get dust, dirt, or other random crumbs under them during installation and the end result doesn't look well. This protector has no dust under it, stuck on easily, and was even able to be re-adjusted during the process. I'm a fan.
This screen protector was easy to put on. I have had it on for a month now and all looks fine. It feels nice on the surface and I don't think it will peel off like the invisible shield. The problem I think with the invisible shield is that its so thick that its easy to accidentally peal off. This protector is very thin and sticks well. Let me say, the invisible shield probably protects the screen better in heavy use but I don't do anything that would cause deep scratches.
I was really impressed by this dry apply screen protector. The install was very easy. It was a perfect install, first try. If you do not like the Zagg look and feel go with the Rocketfish.
Dropped my phone several times and no problem. Plus it fits in my holder
PERFECT FIT...SLIM LINE, UNLIKE THOSE BULKY OTHER ONES THAT TAKE AWAY FROM THE SLEEKNESS OF THE IPHONE.
Soft shell case feels good, fits well and protects the iphone.
After two weeks of regular use (nothing industrial here), the left side of the case which its thin covering the volume buttons has stretched out completely. Not only is it annoying, it hinders use to the left side of the screen.
I bought this case expecting to use it as a backup to my main case - but it quickly has become my main case. It's lightweight (my phone doesn't even feel like it has a case on it(, smooth, fits great, and looks cool on the back. The biggest selling point to me was the fact that it doesn't feel bulky at all like some other cases and really blends in well with the phone.
This case was meant to be a temporary solution until I found one better...but then, I started to like it. The main reason I like this is because it is simple to put on and off. This allows me to put my drivers license and a credit card behind the phone at all times! I no longer carry a wallet and my life has become THAT much simpler, its really great.
I've had mine for over a year now and its still in great shape. I love the fact that it's very gripy so it doesn't slide off and move around when you set it down on uneven surfaces or in the car. It's made in USA, helps support our local jobs and economy. I've had friends want to buy it after seeing and holding it. It doesn't add much to the volume of the phone(4S) but adds just enough to make it easier for someone with bigger hands to hold(adult male). Simple and easy to put on and take off if you need to. I wish it was available in clear. Simple.
Nice to have a product to protect my $700 investment, and not worry about it doing its job! I live in a very harsh climate, Wyoming has all kinds of weather, and it keeps all the dirt and dust out! If it gets wet, just dry it off! I don't panic about a few raindrops getting between the screen and phone. I opened the case the other day because I had missed cleaning lint off a corner...not a speck of dust on the back all clean, looked like I just took my phone out of the box! The screen cover is durable and cleans off well. It's worth the $80 to protect your phone!
Although I was concerned about following all the steps to make the case waterproof, I really liked the online videos instructions they offer. It was very clear to me what I needed to do and it gave me confidence to test my case and if I'm ever not sure about what to do, I can go back online and check out their online video tutorials again.
This is a great case but is difficult to insert phone cord to charging due to it being waterproof. Just takes some time to get the cord in properly. Case is much thinner than the OtterBox that I previously used.
This is a great product that will protect you iPhone from broken screen or water damage. Don,t have to worry when grandkids is using my phone.
The lifeproof case is remarkable for the person who is a little hard on thier electronics, like me. The ONLY down side to this case is the charger issue.
I had my case for almost two months now and I did the water test on the case before I put my phone in it and it passed,I also check the case everyday to make sure it's sealed together and yet the first time I dropped my phone into water the phone broke. So I would not recommend this if you are going to have your phone anywhere near water.
The cover was too expensive for a case. It's durable and waterproof if someone is looking for this use.
I've seen some bad things said about their customer service but give them a break! They will get back to you and they WILL make things right if it needs to be made right! They are a growing company and they are growing fast because their product is actually what they advertise! At first I was skeptical about the sound. How can it be waterproof and you still use it? Then they started speaking my language......Gor-tex! I've been using it in hunting boots for years! It's breathable, yet waterproof!
What I can tell you is that MY experience with this case has been all positive. Put it on the phone before vacation to Florida. First day of vacation- dropped phone in a sandy parking lot (and didnt know it- no pavement to "thud" against). Phone was then picked up by someone who did not turn it into lost and found :-( Long story short, a number was called from my phone so we called it and eventually spoke to someone who knew - the person said "oh, is this a pink iPhone" right away we knew they had it and I was getting it back! And I did get it back!! All in one piece, no scratches, dents, anything. The case is secure so it doesnt just pop off easily. So I retested the waterproofness when I got it back...all good. Had a BLAST taking underwater pictures in the pool!! Worth every penny! I love it!!
I bought this on the advise of a friend and I am very happy with it.
A friend recommended this case to me and I'm so glad I purchased it. The main reason for purchasing this case is it slides into my purse and pocket easily and doesn't get "hung up" like my Otter Box. I did the water test before putting my phone in it and there was no leakage. The only thing I don't like is even with the volume on high the ringer isn't as loud. After several missed calls, I just keep my phone with me now. That's the only negative thing about this phone case. You can not go wrong with this phone case!
For the price, we were expecting for the product to at least keep the iphone secure and free of anything getting between the screen and the shield and that did not happen. I have had to take to case off twice now to wipe off the screen when oil residue had left marks. I have not had the case near water or any condensation so this should not even be a concern but unfortunately it is. The volume on and off tab on the left side is already cracking and I have had the case for just barely over a month. Not satisfied!
I have broken two otterboxes, but my phone did survive. My child's otterbox also broke, but the phone did survive as well. The other problem we had with the otterbox is the silicon cover would stretch out of shape, and the case was bulky. The Lifeproof protects against water, dirt, snow, and shock damage all in a case that is lightweight, slim, and slides comfortably in the pocket. The pink is a nice shade with a hint of sparkle if you look at it just right. The gray part is made of different material making it easy to have a good hold on the phone. It looks like the phone itself is pink or whatever color you choose. I just use apple chargers or accessories or other brands with the same design or an adapter if needed to use the charge/accessory port. I don't use my headphones much,but you do have to have a special cord which is included in order to use headphones. As with any case, there is a increased risk of the screen breaking if the screen comes in contact with a sharp, pointed object like a rock. I do recommend this case to other family members and friends and would like to get ones of these for my iPad when available. Too bad lifeproof does not make these for iPods. The silicon on the Otterbox for those is tearing.
I purchased this case for my husband for Christmas. He was always complaining about his Otterbox Defender (it protects well against falls; however, the skin stretches alot and it is NOT waterproof) being too bulky and unable to slide into his pocket. He loved the Lifeproof case! So, I splurged and bought one for myself. I really love my case...keeps the dust out, protects against falls and moisture. In fact, I am not buying my new iPad until Lifeproof brings its iPad case to market! I am sold on Lifeproof!
I was really excited about this case, especially since I'm so clumsy. It makes it look like I had an entirely pink iPhone, which I loved. But my car charger wouldn't fit with the case on. It was a hassle taking it off in the car every time it began to die before I made it home. Only the Apple Wall Charger fits in the slot, so I traded it for an Otter Box. If they fix that issue, I could see myself repurchasing it, though. It truly was water & shock proof, just a little hard to charge.
I have been extremely happy with my Lifeproof Case. I went from an archaic nextel military rated phone to the iphone. While I have yet to accidently drop any phone (really only 2) I have in water I do habitually drop them getting into the car, pulling them out of my purse, and while handing them off to the kids so I wanted a case that would protect my investment. It has exceeded my expectations at protecting my iphone. It has been dropped without incident more than once in 3 months. I love the pink. My husband has a black case that is working out great as well. I love that we know whose phone is whose. The only complaint that I would have is the static spot, or oily looking spot I get occasionally. It's my understanding that this is because we live where there is more humidity and can't be helped. That being said I will gladly live with a little "oil spot" if I can totally protect my phone. I also loved freaking my husband out when I "submerged" his phone 2 inches under the water in the hot tub. He didn't realize it was waterproof :-) He has now been known to take it in the shower so he can accompany his singing :)
I have bought a Lifeproof case for everyone in my family. LOVE LOVE LOVE Lifeproof
I love that it's slim and not bulky like otter box
The dummy me who drops everything I am now safe.. Love it..
When I opened item, I followed directions exactly as they stated. Works really cool. At first the volume didn't seem that loud but with apple's new update it is louder. When using facetime it was harder for the person to hear me had to speak louder. Other than that it is a cool product and so far I love it. I have the pink and grey one like the colors, the pink is light so it doesn't look like the pepto pink ones!!!
This is the best case made for the iPhone. It doesn't make the phone too bulky, and its made of polycarbonate which allows it to slide in and out of your pocket easily. I take my phone out fishing with me and I never have worry about water as its the only truly waterproof case.
I purchased this cover just a few weeks ago. I returned it for a new one because of the oil spot on the screen. Same thing happened with the new one though. I guess it is a flaw in the design of the product. Speaker is muffled and tinny.
This case is great! It is a hard plastic case and then a silicone cover goes over the hard plastic. Durability of plastic and gripping ability of silicone. The only problem that I've found is that the button to mute the phone is difficult to access. It can be done, but it's tough. Fortunately, I have long nails.
I was looking for something durable but was tired of my outter box & this worked perfect. Love that it fits in my pocket & my phone is now all pink:)
I love this case. I recently purchased an iphone and looked at many cases. I really love the fact that this is very thin and water proof. Not to mention I love the color pink so this is the perfect case for my new phone. One thing though, the screen gets that ugly oily area eventhough I cleaned my phone before putting the case on. Other than that I really love this case.
never ending search for the perfect case ends here. I've gone through so many cases and money searching for that one case that provides the protection i need for my lifestyle and job description, as an EMS/Firefighter, this case is PERFECT! Mil Spec rating for drops and dust protection as well as the best part of it.......wait for it.......IP-68 rating waterproof protection up to 6.6 feet. It's thin and lightweight and doesn't stick to your pocket, all the buttons and ports are easily accessible without ever taking the case off. I HIGHLY recommend this case and every product they put out, Best customer service and company i have ever dealt with. I honestly can't wait for what this company has in store for us in the future, I'm hooked, LifeProof for life.......Let's Go!
I would never recommend this phone case to anyone. I had my daughter's iPhone in this case and not even a full week and the front glass shattered after one drop from 2 ft high from my truck. I now have to send her phone to get the repaired and I will go back to Otter box. Don't throw your money away like I did. Also the access point to get to the headphone jack is horrible. You have to screw in an extra piece to access the headphone jack.
I bought this case. I love it and it more protective! I love the color! I have tested to take my iPhone when I showered, it really works!! It is the best case that I am looking for!
I love my pink Lifeproof case! I love knowing that it is safe from water, drops, dirt, snow, etc. I have small children so it puts my mind at ease knowing that it is completely protected when they grab a hold of my phone. I have had the case for a few months now and the ony complaint that I have is that the case rattles when it rings or you play music but in my opinion it is still a good trade off for the protection that the case provides. I have been wanting to convert my iPhone to a pink one and this saves me the hassle of doing so all while giving me amazing protection. I love Lifeproof and will never consider ever buying another case! I can't wait to get one in white as well!
This case is awesome! Sound quality is fine, no dust or dirt under case, and although I don't make a habit of submerging all the time it is super nice to be able to play angry birds in the shower. I love the color!
LifeProof = water - shock- snow- sand = fun life !!!! I don't have to worry about my phone. I can use it anywhere. In the shower, on the boat, in the rain..... I've had my case since August and it is the best case ever. Customer Service is great, too. Warranty on case is fantastic. Really nice to have such a great US company. Join them on their FaceBook fan page. They are very fun! Bought them for my husband, brother, god-daughter. Can't wait for the rest of the family to get an iPhone. Belt Clip is great too!!!! Let's Go!!!!!!
Back when LifeProof first came out with the iPhone case we bought a pink one for my wife. She's used her case for almost a year now and has had no problems with it at all. The cases are very sleek and don't stick to the inside of your pocket like most of the other iPhone cases on the market. My wife absolutely loves her pink one. she says it looks "classy". Being able to go swimming and taking incredibly crystal clear underwater videos is amazing. Knowing that if you accidentally drop your phone in the dirt, mud, rain, sand, or snow and not having to worry that it's ruined is very comforting. I've had just about every iPhone case that's available and the LifeProof case far exceeds them all.
This case is pretty pink and rocks could have freedom without it must have and super sleek works great water snow dirt all
I bought this case because I have two small Nieces that enjoy playing with my phone, and I didn't want to take any chances in terms of it breaking. Positives: It's definitely drop-proof. I've dropped my phone at least three times since I bought it in November (all have been on concrete) and it's been perfect afterward - no cracks or breaks anywhere. I haven't had a need to see if it's water proof or not. Nice, tight fit. This case is great for when I take my phone out on the town - it's not big and bulky like an otter box or other cases and I can just tuck it in my back pocket. Negatives: Sound quality. With the charger door shut the sound quality just isn't as good. Charger cable - if you have the older charger cable that is a little bigger in size (like 1'' big), it won't work and it won't fit. You have to have a charger with the smaller size (the one that is .5''). Headphone jack - If you have an "L" shaped headphone jack then it won't fit - i've had to use just my iPhone headphones that came with it. When I took apart my case a couple days ago, the seal on the inside started coming off...not sure if that's supposed to happen or not. All in all it's a good case, but i'm not as thrilled with it as I thought I would be. Still, I believe you get your money's worth in terms of protection, but not in sound quality and other small things.
Bought this phone to replace an older iPhone. Old one was possessed. Daughter loves this phone. Loves the new camera feature to be able to talk to another iphone user and actually SEE them. Also likes that the upgrade to the new phone was simple and luckily, thanks to iCloud, she lost nothing! Great phone for a great price. Old one lasted about 2 years. Hoping this one lasts alot longer! :)
I chose this item over the otter box because it was smaller and it was recommended by my brother the i genious. I am happy with it overall but the speaker being muffled stops people from hearing me well at times.
This is the best protective case you can buy. My two biggest issues are dropping and getting it wet. This case protects it from both! It is not just water resistant it is waterproof. Able to drop your phone into water and pull it out and it works.
I would recommend one for anyone would needs extra protection. As a swim coach I wouldn't trust my phone with anything else.
Great product at a reasonable price. Feels secure and works very good for taking pictures under water.
I love this iphone case. I have a habit of dropping my phone in water, so it is perfect for me.
I would never recommend this case, it did not protect the phone against shattering and the cover is too far from the phone.
It's great for protecting against water but not so good for hearing messages due to tightness of case.
great case, looks great and fits so the Phone stays slilm and the belt clip is a bit big, but holds the phone very tightly
this is my second case i had the purple and i gave it to my son so i bought today the pink and grey this cases is the best case out there i have had it over 6 months and i shower with it it has falllen alot and it aslo fell in a bucket of water and my iphone did not get damged at all.. a great buy last long durable i just cant find nuthing wrong with it.. like i said my second case diffrent color..
This is a wonderful product as far as phone protection. It was, however, a little on the expensive side at $79.99. Lifeforce case even has a screw plug to protect the headphone/auxillary jack from water damage, so yes this is a great case if you want to protect your investment.
Love my new IPhone 4! Previously had a Blackberry, the IPhone is a big upgrade! The new software update with ICloud makes the IPhone even better than it was when I purchased it a couple of months ago. I've also had an Android phone before and found it much more difficult to navigate/operate than the IPhone. I would recommend the IPhone to anyone looking for a smart phone.
I bought this phone for my wife. I have a 3GS thats 2 years old and it still works great, so I highly recommended another iPhone. I wouldn't recommend any other phone due to my previous experience with apple products: great features, great picture/screen quality, easy to use, easy to set-up... Great product! I also purchased the GeekSquad black-tie protection for this device (for 2 years all at once). Insurance on such a phone is a must in my opinion and the price is reasonable for what you get (less than $10/month if purchased all at once).
Great phone. Working up to the newest. Had a problem with the initial purchase. Best Buy was great to resolve.
The IPhone 4 is so user friendly. I had no previous experience with an IPhone and was able to use it very easily right from the start. It takes excellent pictures and the IPhone makes it so easy to share pix through email, Facebook, text, etc.!!! I also love the wide variety of apps that are available!! It is actually easier to access some of my accounts with my IPhone apps then on my laptop!!
Great phone. Easy to use. Works much better than the Droid.
It's an iPhone. Wait for the next gen if you can, I couldn't.
I was searching for a new phone and debating between a droid and an iPhone. I currently own a Mac laptop, iPod, and an iPad so I was leaning towards the iPhone, but friends told me to play with a droid just to experience both phones. I was not happy with trying to figure out the droid and while people say it is more customizable I found it extremely complicated and ended up with the iPhone and I am beyond satisfied. I can sync all previously downloaded apps with the iPhone through iTunes instead of having to redownload all the apps. I love the ability to make folders to consolidate all my games or entertainment apps. The camera is amazing and I love having a camera on both sides on the phone. I find something new everyday that makes me even happier with my decision. I also recommend purchasing the buy back program because while I paid $199 for the phone the retail price is $699 and the buy back program is based on the retail price, meaning if I go back within six months I will get $350 on a best buy gift card which amounts to more than I paid for the phone.
Pros Good battery if your not on it 24/7 Great software Good camera Ipod and phone all into one device Great apps Cons cant take the battery out cant upgrade the memory
I just bought this phone after taking back a Samsung Nexus S 4G on the Sprint network. I had an iphone a couple years ago and this phone kind of takes me back. I forgot what it was like to have a phone that works so seamlessly between the hardware and the software. I have also used Android for a few years now so I'm pretty familiar with that as well. WHAT I LIKE: Apple has stricter requirements to developers to publish apps, so the apps that get placed on the market are useful, fluid and without hiccups (for the most part). A lot of people would consider Androids free apps to be a bigger benefit, but a developer will work harder to write lines of code on an application that he can charge more money on. Higher app prices=higher quality and more thought-out applications and more time invested in making them. Rhapsody on iphone is better than the Android version. Kindle on iphone is better and so is Tune-In Radio. I don't use a million apps, but the apps I DO use need to work and I don't mind paying a small fee for a clean application. Android still hasn't grasped the concept that more applications being pushed out faster and faster for free is not necessarily better. As a developer, if they make one Android app then they are required to write code for Froyo, Gingerbread and Honeycomb AND meet the demands of old phones as well as the new dual core processor phones AND charge nothing for their apps because people have come to expect it. SOMETHING has to give there. The hardware amongst Android phones is light years ahead of Apple now but Apple knows that most people don't need a supercomputer in their hands. They need a processor fast enough to run the software that they want and they need software that makes their life easier. Apple has this nailed. I got kind of tired of getting the latest and greatest Android phone where you could customize literally everything but the actual basics of the phone like the speakerphone and earpiece sucked. That's what happens though when LG or HTC is pushed to make 10 different "exclusive" handsets per year per carrier. Quality control will suffer and from the phones I have purchased that's definitely the case. I guess after a lot of use on both platforms I just decided that I prefer lower specs that are tested thoroughly and quality controlled over amazing specs that get forced out the door half-finished. WHAT I DON'T LIKE: No Swype. I miss this Android-only feature every single day. Sometimes I still try to Swype on the iphone keyboard because I forget. No Google maps. No removable battery/memory. I also don't like that iphone uses its own proprietary charging connector rather than microUSB. That's just a way to keep Belkin and other accessory manufacturers happy. That's pretty much it. I also despise iTunes but then again, Android does the same thing in a way. Try to access anything on the Andoid market without a gmail account. Try to find a phone without 30 useless Google beta programs bundled in and you can't get them off without rooting the phone. Apple makes money from charging premium prices for a premium product and Google/Andoid makes money from passing along your personal information that's readily available to them via Gmail/Docs/Talk/Buzz/Goggles/Wallet/Maps/Chat...................
The phone is no different then the Black iPhone 4G. However the color does make a change in its appearance. It goes well with a black sleeve or case. The performance is what's expected from Apple and its OP system. I had a Android OS and didn't care for the delay in processing. Apple is simple and offers much better applications. At first I thought the color was a dull white but it's Macbook white. or Apple white. .
I have 3 family members with iphones. I figured it would be easier for me to learn to use as opposed to an Android system phone.
iphone is not it is all cracked up to be. have to charge it everyday. never had to do that with my other phones. my son's galaxy is much better and a better buy.
great phone. i use it everyday. sleek shape. very appealing.
Great phone for only 50 dollars (sale ended June 30,2012) fast and easy to use besides the slight battery drain. A tip if you get the phone do not leave chargeing overnight it will mess up the battery(it is sensitive). Overall great phone besides Siri on the 4s but I can live without it. Great product!
We have all apple products and love how they intergrate together
I really like iphones. i wish I would of gotten the 4S but is SIRI really worth anothe $100? If you like to play games I recommend more memory I am already tapped out on 8megs......Get 16 or 32 it's worth it!
Excelent phone was able to move data from old 3G over with no problem. Runs circles around old 3G. Proven tech knowledge Not a android
The phone is very useful. The variety of apps makes it useful and fun.
I've been looking to purchase a new iPhone for the longest time, but the price is what stopped me. Best Buy offered THE best price for the product, and I am completely thrilled with the shopping experience and with the iphone.
I don't know anyone who doesn't love their iPhone and I have finally joined the multitudes. It only took a couple days to adjust to the sensitivity of the touchscreen vs. the keyboard on my old phone. And one touch access to email and the internet makes life so easy. I should have followed everyone's advice and gotten it two years ago.
iPhone really is wonderful. Good Product. Love it.
Got such a terrific price, I bit the "Apple" bullet and got an iPhone. The Best Buy service rep was quite knowledgeable and offered several tips before my decision to buy. Took me about a week of stumbling around to get clear on how to enter stuff and use apps. But even the rep said I'd learn more by "playing with it" than reading a manual (online). I should say this is my first Smartphone - and so glad I went with iPhone and not another brand. This is my first Apple product. Adding the "data" charges get the monthly service price up there, but so far it's worth it.
I love the built-in shopping list, compass, and video camera,
I am not an Apple person -- products are over priced and not worth the premium they charge. I wanted to buy the Samsung phone that is equal to this phone but my son said that I wouldn't be able to face time with him to see my grand daughter -- so I'll put up with this phone so I can see my grand daughter. I don't think it is as easy as it seems. I still can't figure out how to turn off the music, other than hit the pause button. When my 2 year period is up, I'll get the Samsung phone.
Good product to upgrade to from 3Gs. But I hope voice recognition should have been improved.
love this phone will buy a new one when my contract is up! Love Best Buy TOO!
I have owned dozens of Apple products over the years and I have never been disappointed. The iPhone 4 is no different. Excellent quality. You get what you pay for with Apple.
BestBuy representatives do not know all that the companies you will get your service with will require and what their rules are. We bought this phone under the impression that we could keep the same phone number (a Best Buy representative assured us of this), all we were to do was call AT&T and get that done. Next day we call AT&T and it turns out we couldn't since the number was a Texas number and the others in the family plan were Florida numbers. We went back to Best Buy Mobile and the manager didn't even acknowledge us. The other representative struggled to learn why AT&T couldn't import the number, even after we explained to him what they had told us. We waited there for him to get the same answer from an AT&T representative as we had given him for over an hour. At the end of the day, we were stuck with a phone number we did not want AFTER we were promised different. My advice is to go to the actual phone company store and get all your details there.
This is my first iPhone and I simply love it. I should have bought one sooner, it is so easy to use, very straight forward.
The iPhone is great for someone who is new to the concept of "smartphone" and it's extremely easy to use. I like the texting and photo applications the most about this phone-- its very easy to text and takes beautiful pictures that are easy to share. The notifications bar is a great tool to kinda "sum up" stuff thats' important to you. There are millions of apps, and a lot of iPhone users so it's easy to identify what apps are good and what doesn't work. The phone's also been around for a long time so there aren't many bugs anymore. The lil device is consistent and works well. Some might say that it does everything... but the one thing it doesn't do is make calls very well. It sounds hollow when you talk into the phone, the volume doesn't get loud (which is a huge peeve for me since I'm in loud places a lot), and I can never hear clearly and unless i'm using the ear buds and even that isn't that good. It kinda reminds me of talking in a plastic cup and string phones I made in second grade. I don't know if its the network or the phone, but even in full coverage zones I constantly see voicemails pop up and no missed call. Overall, this is a terrific device and I recommend it for anyone who doesn't have a smartphone, uses applications, or wants to become phone-dependent.
This purchase is my second iPhone (previously owned an iPhone 3G). I had been wanting the eight gig iPhone 4 as my 3G was no longer working correctly, having been dropped all too often. Everything came together nicely as I received an "Instant $50 Off any purchase" coupon via e-mail. I went to my local Best Buy. I had the phone, the nice (and absolutely necessary) "Incase" slider case within 30 minutes, all for under $95. It was a memorable event! All in all, everything about this transaction was EASY!
I Started with Ipad 2 And decided to get the I-phone. The I-pad was a little inconvinent to carry around shopping but it was easy to learn. So I purchased the Iphone and it is easy to use. I like the idea of working on the Ipad and it down loads to the phone. I'm getting use to the smaller keys - I just have to slow down.
I love this version of the iPhone. It has everything I need in a phone right now.
My husband is electronically challenged and he has no problem navigating his new phone. He loves it and we welcomed him to the 21st century. Thank you
It's fast, reliable and the battery charge is amazing. From someone that upgraded from a 3g to this, well, it is a great improvement.
I like my iPhone but I have difficulty using it so I need something to help me operate my iPhone.
Did have problems with sims card not working in this phone. Was told that this is a frequent problem with the phone. You can't reseat it yourself because it is too hard to get to. Battery life is poor. Have to recharge every day. Older phone would last 3- 4 days.
This phone is used by my wife who is tech phobic. But she has taken to using this iphone very well. She has even bought apps (for grandkids). She loves the camera. High praise for OS.
Have had several smartphones (Android)-the iphone handles mufti-tasking much faster.
Family has been trying to get me buy one of these forever...WHY did I wait so long!?!
I bought this phone for my wife and she really likes it. It is easy for her to use and understand. While not the latest Apple offering, the iPhone 4 is still a great looking and performing phone.
I just upgraded my teenage daughter's phone from an LG Xenon to an Apple iPhone 4. To say she was surprised would be an understatement. The phone has performed great since the upgrade and my daughter has found some great ways to be productive with the phone and the new features compared to her old phone. She obviously has fun on the phone too, but it is great that she can find productive things to do with such a fantastic piece of technology. Keep up the great work Apple!
I love my i-Phone! I held out forever getting one and when my old phone broke, I caved and got the 4. The extra money for the 4S didn't seem worth it. I got the 8GB because as long as you're using the Cloud, you don't really need that much storage.
Got the iphone 4 when it started selling for $100, and i am glad to say that it was a great decision. Have no problems at all all and have loved the simplicity of it. Great phone and would recommend anyone get it. The only thing is make sure you buy a good case because if you drop it, it will definitely break.
My son convinced me into purchasing an iphone. I was happy and content with my little Verizon Envy phone. I can't imagine life without an iphone now. The phone is amazing. The quality of photos on my iphone are better than my camera. The internet, games, emai - all right there in the palm of your hand!!! I love it!!!
i luv mu iphone4.............great service at best buy
Very good slim phone, light weight easy to use, great apps
While this is one model previous to the famous Siri phone, this is definitely worth it at the price it is now offered at because of the release of the iPhone 4s. This phone was for my husband, I have been using one for over a year, it really is a large step up from the 3Gs, and iOS 5 makes it that much better. If you are one a budget, this is a great deal for an iPhone, no you won't get Siri, but you will get a good phone.
This is the first IPhone I've owned and love it. I was considering the Motorola Atrix 2 but after talking to owners of the apple phones they convinced me there was much more to owning an IPhone that just the phone, especially the Apple customer service! Since I already owned a IPad it made an easy transition. I love the great apps and ease of use and I purchased the 8GB phone for $64.99. I saved money by going to BB and they took in 2 old phones toward the purchase making it even a greater deal. I don't store a lot of music or photos so the 8GB phone was a great fit for me. One recommendation is a cover so you not touching the metal antenna which makes a bid difference on reception.
Over all a great phone! Always wanted one and now I have one, and I am very satisfied with it!
I love my iphone. I am enjoying all the neat thngs I can do with it.
Phone has been great. Battery life is amazing! No need for constant rebooting like android.
I started out with a 3GS and up graded to this while waiting for the new I Phone to come out in September or October of this year. Now that I have had an I phone I don't believe I will ever own anything else. It's very simple to use and all functions are easy to find.
First smart phone and I was nervous about using it. It's very easy to use and was a great buy. You can teach an old dog new tricks.
I upgraded to an iPhone 4 when my 3GS started failing. The 4 is a little slicker than the 3GS, and apps work better. But when I got it home, calls were dropping regularly. I went back to Best Buy, and the sales person was nice but a little clueless about why that would happen. I told her than my husband has a 3GS and was holding calls better than my 4. The sales person directed me to AT&T. The guy there was very sharp and replaced the SIM card in the phone. Now it holds calls well.
Very happy with my iPhone. Taking pictures, texting, and of course making calls are all a breeze. The AT&T folks were very helpful getting my contacts copied over from my old (non-smart) phone. All smiles here :)
Good voice clarity, easy to use. Nice large numbers for dialing, easy to see text.
easily to carry and text and play it is so useful to do with it
I am really enjoying my phone. It is faster, the camera is clear, the camera has a flash which my old one did not have. The camera flips around for self photos. Love that! Easier to keep up with my Facebook friends. Good value for the money. Good service too! If you are looking for a Phone that does so much then this is the phone for you.
This is my first smart phone and after getting the iPad, getting an iPhone for my first smart phone is a no-brainer. Simply put, it is the best smart phone in the world. It's design is simply a stroke of genius. The control is intuitive and easy to learn and use. What more is the number of Apps available that put all other smart phone OS to shame. One grip is that it is 2 generations old and 8 gig of memory may not be good enough, but because it is free, I am not complaining about it...
Great value! Was bought to keep me in touch while away from home.
It's real easty to use compared to my other phone.
It's a great phone and I love it. I highly recommend the iPhone.
best phone I ever had. I own iPad1 and the new iPad so I tried this iPhone GREAT!!!!
This is a great phone. I don't think i will ever want any other type of phone.
I had the exact phone in white & had more apps, photos, etc, and there was never a storage issue, but with this phone, I'm having problems with storage.
I first want to say I came from a hTc Desire HD with a much larger screen and 4G. I have purchased 2 apple computers and was disillusioned by the difficulty to interface between different devices and having to learn the nuances of the android os. Such as having to google where files are kept in the android os. I was hoping the i world would be easier as I have always heard. The phone feels quality and the calls have been great, probably better than the hTc. Battery life is definitely better. The screen is so beautiful and so small on the iphone. And my biggest regret is the speed, so slow. I actually still use my hTc like an iTouch, because the Beyond Pod player is so much better than the iTunes. I am still learning iTunes admittedly. If it was faster I would be iphone all the way.
great phone, camera, GPS, organizer, game . . . . .
Wouldn't have anything else. I have been using an iphone for years.
I require a heavy duty case- because when I choose a "pretty" case over a durable one- my phone suffers... I just shattered a screen which could have been EASILY avoided if I'd had a case like this! I like that it's a hinge case, and I really don't have to pry anthing apart, or take the silicone off first before I get into it. It snaps together really easy, but stays in place perfectly! Every bit of my phone is protected, whereas the otterbox still had exposed areas. The protection around the screen is great because there is no chance for injury to the phone. I didn't find it any more bulky than the otterbox defender, I am VERY happy with this case! Also on my otterbox defender case, I had a hard time keeping the flaps in their places- this case does not have this problem at all!
This protector feels like a toy. Everything is made of cheap plastic and the snapps that hold it together ate so thin that if you take it off your phone a couple times they will snapp right off.
I think i've had every kind of phone that is out there, a smart phone a nextal phone, (you remember those) and this by far is the easiest phone i've had yet. All my family, friends and co-workers kept telling me you'll love it, it sooo easy to use. They were right !! I can't think of one thing that I don't like about it.
All in all I love my new iPhone and would recommend it to everyone. My kids love it too.
Had the worst customer service in my life. Entire process to transfer phones took about 1.5 hours when I was told it would take an hour. Man working there who helped me completely screwed up my fathers' work phone(we are on family plan). I hope no one has to go through what my family went through with my upgrade phone change... He caused us a lot of stress and havoc trying to get my dad's phone back to normal.
I was a Blackberry user for years and then decided to try an Android...was never happy with the Droid; one issue after another. Gave much thought to going back to the Blackberry, but decided to give the iPhone a try, and am now wishing that I had gone with the bigger memory capacity. I am still learning all the great things the phone can do, but have been amazed at the ease with which to talk on the phone with one person and text with another, and the phone never "bog- down" with all the processes happening. I really wish that I had gone iPhone sooner.
I have had a Blackberry and an Android before IPhones finally came to Sprint. The Iphone is night compared to that pairs' day.
bought this phone and a lifeproof case for it love them both so far
I got this for my wife the same time with me but she use it more than I do. 2 Fs, FaceTime and Facebook are her favorite.
It is an iPhone made by apple. The only reason somebody would say something negative about this product is because they don't have it and they want it. Or, they have android and are waiting for a single android OS phone to outsell the iPhone. Wonderful product apple rules.
This iPhone is excellent. I am an Apple junkie so I knew I wouldn't go wrong buying this.
I've wanted an iPhone for years and was unable to afford the plan because all carriers tossed aside their unlimited data plans. After attempting to use an Android phone for 4 months I bought this phone and before the transaction was complete I was up and running! The phone is very user friendly (I've had an iPod touch for 3+ years so I was pretty familiar with Apple products). I do not think I will buy any other brand of phone, I have met my cellular soul mate!!
I love this phone. So many possibilities! Nicely priced for all the things I can now do. Easy to surf Facebook and other social sites. Easy use of the Internet. Fast txt msging! A great phone overall!
The phone is great, is easy to operate and has many features. Just becareful when talking without a handset. The touch screen is very sensitive, and your cheek can put the call on speaker or mute without you realizing it.
great product .......................................
Love this phone. the price was great. because everyone wants a Iphone.
I Love my iphone !!!!!! Fun, awesome, fast. Love the color.
took it back to Geeks, store said 1-3 days needed $50.00 deposit for loaner phone (not a I phone). Geeks sent e-mail after 4 days saying phone is ready. Go back to store phone won't turn on (not ready). leave phone again Geeks call and say phone is ready go back to store phone not ready (this was a call from the Geeks for the first phone pick- up just a little late) 3 trips to the store still have loaner (not a I-phone). Maybe i should shop at apple store
One of the best products I bought would recommend to everyone I know
I use my iPhone a lot to go on web text and call I find the apps very helpful to a shortcut to what I need
I love the iPhone 4 because it is faster than any other phone I've had.It has awesome picture. I dont need anything higher than an 8gb.
Love the iPhone and iPads from apple. I have not had one problem so far!
I had the iPhone 4 and went back to Android, only to go back to Apple with the iPhone 4S and I have to say its an amazing phone, but I just wish they'd make the battery life a lot better for Apple phones, then it'd be so much better, but other than that its an amazing phone!
I am a longtime Blackberry user and I miss the qwerty keyboard and the ability to personalize the phone; however, the Iphone is awesome overall.
Easy phone to operate, the only down fall is I can not get my .edu email added.
I love my iPhone. I've been wanting one forever. It does everything. I hardly touch my iPod anymore. Fast Internet service. Easy downloading. Updates software on its own. Amazing apps. I get excited everytime I use my phone.
I love this phone, very fast and durable. Use it constantly
This is actually my daughters phone, and she loves it! It's an iphone, what more can we say!
if u dont have one think about it it great would and have recomended to a friend100:/:
I love this phone. Up untill now I have just used sliding phones...so this is a whole new world for me. I have had it a couple of weeks, and I have loved learning how to use it. It is really simple to use. I also love that I can find the answers really easy online. I'm pretty sure that I will be an iPhone girl from now on. I have apps to help my preschooler work on letters and shapes, and also to help my 3rd grader work on multiplication. I also like that my battery last as long as my old phone. It is the perfect phone for parents. I LOVE IT.
As a heavy business user, I have used, Blackberry's, Windows Mobile, Android Phones and Nokia. I thought iPhone would be a fun phone but I was very cautious about using the iPhone for business. After my most recent failure with the Windows Phone 7, I decided to give the iPhone a shot. Wow! The hardware is head and shoulders above any other phone I have tried or used. When you add a top notch hardware system to a well developed software system and the most well developed app store, the iPhone is a clear winner. The accessories that are available can not be matched. Things I am most impressed with: Battery Life. Camera Quality. Phone call quality. Touch screen accuracy. Speaker Phone quality. Very Impressed with the whole package. Get one and you will be satisfied.
All the great features of the iPhone are now available to the Sprint community. It is truly a great piece of gear. I am NOT a power user by any means, so this phone will always exceed my needs. Only after I purchased the phone, did I realize that the 8gig version is not a 4S, it is just a 4. So far the only thing that I have found to be different is that there is no Siri option on the 8gig. Other than that,the iPhone lives up to its hype.
Great product, bought a waterproof Lifeproof case from Best Buy too. Apple makes another fine product.
I got my phone as an early christmas present from my Hubby and I've fallen in love with the phone. Easy to use. Great reception. Long Battery life, I use it at work to play all my music and even use Pandora Radio and the battery lasts me all day. Love the camera.. The ability to have all my itunes and ibooks on my phone is great. Before I had my ipod and i had my Samsung Intercept I would have to carry both with me at all times. Now I'm just able to grab one item and go.. Now my Hubby is jealous and wants one for himself.. Birthday is coming up might end up buying him one.
If i had the extra money i would have got the iphone 4s but very happy with the iphone4 no disappointments at all
The phone is great with a lot of available apps to choose from. The only downside as with all Apple products is the lack of customizable options. This isn't to take away from the phone itself because I love it! Next for me is the 4S!!
I got this phone a couple days before Christmas. I love it! I haven't downloaded any music to it though. I have downloaded some apps though. It hasn't frozen up on me or anything like my LG Optimus did.
Ok..to start of...No the White Iphone 4 does Not look "plasticy" like some people have said!..Looks and Feels Great!...and it DOES come with ios 5.0 and Icloud I was told the iphone 4s did but the 4 did not but after you have the phone on for an hr or so you get an ios update to 5.1. I have not any problems with internet/download speed 's and the 5.0 camera looks great too! sorry dont know all the techinal termes, thats why i really didnt go into it "speed" Before this phone I had the HTC Evo 4g...After buying this phone yesterday..that phone was Not for me!..to many widgets and wadgets! and un usefull stuff!..You put what YOU want on this phone.and either you like it or not..if not..You delete it!..obviously it does come with some apps stuck on there..Appstore/itunes/music/notes/reminders.ect...stuff we like anyway! Ohh and when you first get the phone and are looking for "contacts" there in the "utilities folder..just drag it out..I was really confused until i asked the guy at best buy lol The one thing I was worried about was Size...considering I had the htc evo 3d last summer and I hated it because i was always messing up texts!..thats I went back to the Evo 4...NO this thing feel's great, texting wise and all around.. And I personally have had no battery life isssues with this phone! Ok the only down fall for this phone that i think is...No LED external light to notify you that you missed a call/text..so if you didnt hear it ringtone/sound..ya gotta keep checking it "waking the device up" Hope my review helped! Enjoy!
I really liked my EVO 3D but this phone is amazing!! Never going back!! Apple for life!!
If u have an android and going to IPhone major adjustment! When dialing out the name or # on ur phone will NOT auto populate until entire # or name is entered. The speed does not compare to android, loads very quickly and display is good. Battery life is the longest I've experienced w any phone.
Excellent Phone with a lot of apps. Good battery life.
I moved from a Droid to an iPhone and I'm soooo happy that I did! Battery life is way better, no freezing and everything is so much faster on the iPhone. Siri is pretty awesome especially when I'm driving and I can text someone or read a text just by telling her what to do. The pictures are super clear and the ability to edit them and remove redeye is just amazing. The only thing that I miss from my Droid (Samsubg Galaxy Epic) is the Swype since that made texting and emailing so much easier and faster. All in all, I'm so happy that I made the switch and will be an iPhone owner for the rest of my life!!!
Overall, and so far, (I've only had it for about 4 weeks); it has been great. Apple Products are the best (to me anyway)!!
The service providers signal varies dramatically, and sucks for downloading. The phone itself is awesome!
Great phone...really enjoying the phone Would recommend the Iphone to anyone wanting to upgrade their phone
Just wished there were more phone features for the parents to use.
Besides the front camera making the photos blurry and the camera gettign stuck from time to time- NO complaints I called about the camera and they said bring it in for a simple update!
Im so glad I switched from my andriod phone to the iPhone. I love the battery life and how everything is so easy to set up and easy to find all the features. I couldnt stand the android phone's battery life. I definitely will not be switching phones for a very long time. Love Apple products.
example Have to go through itunes, hard to set call tones, no sprint navigation.
Love it! Great picture quality. Friend shocked that the pics I posted were taken with cell phone. Use it for work and fun. Would never go back to Blackberry after this and I liked my Blackberry.
This phone has a good camera and apps, but calls drop and the call sound cuts in & out. I heard this can be helped by a case, but have not been able to try that yet. The GPS apps available for the iPhone are bad. There is no voice assist and read the directions are not practical while you drive.
Good quality product for the money. Great value. Wanted a white iPhone for a long time and bestbuy had them.
I am an Apple product lover for years, so I knew what to expect from this phone. 3G kinda sucks when it comes to watching any YouTube or Facebook videos
It's amazing what it can do still trying to learn everything
This is my first high tech phone, and I love it. I combined two gadgets into one compact item.
Dies pretty fast but all in all i love it... Just gotta keep the charger with me at work lol
This is a great phone. It's durable and a great phone. It's a lot of fun and easy to use. I like the easy use of the phone. There are thousands of apps to download. Great phone. Only thing is sometimes it drops calls.
I was able to put all my Itunes songs from my Ipod with very little ease. ( the phone pretty much did it for me) The apps that are offered are great! The display and camera show very well. The phone is the perfect size.
The iPhone 4 provides a great way to keep up-to-date on personal e-mails, text messages, phone calls, and important news through the day. Precision and quality of a built-in digital camera and high definition video (with audio) serve as excellent product features. I love listening to music, and the iPhone 4 allows me to do so. Crispness and clearness of high quality sound provide an enjoyable audio experience. In addition, over 200 songs remain stored on my iPhone 4 and over 6 GB of space still remains. With over 300,000 iPhone apps available, options for use and capabilities of the phone deem limitless. While battery life is limited, the phone charges fairly quickly. The cellphone's slim appearance allows me to fit it inside a purse or pocket, or slide it into an arm band while working out. Despite its slender appearance, characteristics of durability and reliability render the device incomparable to similar products on the market. (amn)
i hate the phone..it not a good phone with sprint service...
I absolutely love this! My phone tends to die often and I love that I can flip the switch and in a matter of seconds my dying phone is charging no matter where I am. I would certainly recommend this to someone who travels often. No having to plug you phone in at airports or look for power outlets to charge your phone. I will say it does add a little weight to the phone itself, however, it's not noticeable after a few days of using it. Highly would recommend this for someone who is always on the go! Definitely worth every penny!
This product is the best addition I've made to my iPhone. I travel extensively and it offers the ability to keep my phone charged for close to two days. I do everything on this phone - read books, play games, watch movies - and the Mophie keeps me going! The case has a nice texture that makes it easy to grip and adds very little bulk or weight to the phone.
i love this product it actually enhance the battery life to my phone then i could actually chare my phone twice with mophie air plus, i really like this product i just wish the color on the side could be brighter like the picture and doesnt get dirty on the side color, but other than that its great!!!!!!!!!
I really like this case. It's sophisticated and feminine, with a shimmery gold back. The only thing I would like better is if the border were crack-resistant and had a little more of a lip to protect the face.
My friend had this case on her phone and I borrowed hers one day when my phone was dying and there were no outlets. It charged my phone in about 1 1/2 hours. This is the best invention. I can't believe I did know about these cases earlier. I ended up buying one a couple of months ago and I use it all of the time. I love the LED lights at the bottom that let you know how much juice is left in the case. Very cool.
My battery in my iPhone was only getting me thru about half a work day. My friend told me about the Juice Pack and now I cannot live without it. The all white gloss finish looks almost the same as my phone and the case doesnt add much bulk at all. I really like how I dont have to use the Apple cable now and I can use it with any of my friends micro USB chargers. If you have an iPhone its a must!
You need a case for the case!! Cracks, scratches easily. Good to extend battery time. I can't find anything else that's why I recommend it
The case looks great and is slim but, there are some flaws. The case scratches easily and if you ever possibly think you will drop the phone, don't buy this. I droped mine today and the screen cracked. I love the design, but the protection is almost nothing.
If you EVER think you might drop your iPhone, do not buy this. I drop mine occasionally and in one month dropped it twice and it shattered my screen both times. Thats $125 a pop. InCase worked ok for me for a slim case and I use the LifeProof now which keeps the phone waterproof and in like new condition. Lesson learned; your phone is an expensive investment. I actually returned this to Best Buy; in their trash at the phone department.
well dont buy this item it has a bunch of problems and i will be returning it, first off there is no cut out for the silence button, second the buttons are all little and you cant even tell if your pressing them or not i dont like that, third very bad quality from the speakers especially when making phone calls very hard to hear whose talking to you. only thing i like about this case is the way it looks and that it does feel durable, also it doesn't fit in the holster well you have to kind of work it in not good.
Join the crowd. It's a great phone, great computer, great everything. Accessories are plentiful....nothing bad to say.
The iPhone 4S features a powerful dual-core A5 chip with faster graphics for browsing the Web, switching between apps, gaming and more. The 8.0MP camera boasts advanced optics and shoots 1080p HD...
I had gone without a phone for about 1 1/2 years and finally couldn't handle being teased anymore so I bought this iPhone. I love it! Couldn't be easier to use as far as texting, emailing, taking photos and managing apps. The only complete fail is Siri. That goofy "assistant" does NOT work. I've fought with her 10 times and totally given up on the functionality.
I love the iphone. Now I don't have to carry two devices in the car. I have the convenience of blue tooth phone and ipod. The only drawback, so far, is that iphone does not support Adobe.
Again, another APPLE product that "out-of-the-box" is horrible!!! you cant do anything with this phone. kind of sad when i have to pay all this money for a smart phone, and its no smarter than a standard flip phone. the only way to make this thing "great" as it says it can be, is to jailbreak it. I am annoyed that for as expensive as it is, that i wouldnt have to do anything illegal to it. And, not too mention, apple only works with apple. its a monopoly. So because i dont have itunes, i dont have music on my phone... def going back to droid. droid is awesome straight out of the box. and is compatible with anything and everything. NO HASSLES. just point and it works...
I love my IPhone 4S!!! This is the phone that you need to get!!!
I am on my iPhone now filling out the review. I love my iPhone. I am so glad Verizon carried it. I got my phone at best buy because I had rewards Certificates and gift cards. Guys at mobile department Were awesome!!!
After using (and enjoying) a Droid for 2 years, I opted to go with the iPhone to get better sync with my other Mac products (MacBook and iPad). The change was HUGE! All in all, if you use an Android based phone with "normal" pc's - stick with it....Google and Apple will never cooperate and you'll find it easier to stay in system; but if you have anything else Mac you would find a huge benefit in the iPhone!!
I had a blackberry before this phone and I can't even believe the difference. The iphone 4s is awesome! It's so easy to use and lots of fun to play with! Siri sometimes doesn't understand what you are saying so that can get annoying. But other than that, this is the best phone!
Love Siri, can't wait for that feature on my iPad. Within a couple hours of getting the phone, I had my Outlook contacts and email synced with the phone. Photo Stream is great, I just took pictures on campus and now they've uploaded to my computer so I can share. Such a simple and beautiful interface.
I have been anti-apple for so long but I finally broke down and got the 4s about a month ago. I feel like I have sold my soul to the darkside but I would do it again without hesitation. The 4S is incredibly fast and intuitive. Siri is fun and the interface is so simple yet intense. I have no complaints at all. The camera takes better pictures than and 12mp Canon and HD video is awesome with two kids.
Switched from Apple as new Android models are too large to carry phone comfortably in pocket (replaced original Droid). While not 4G, the size was the determining factor in the switch. cool phone... Very happy. PS. Not sure 32gb was necessary (i have 3 full movies, 400 songs, 20 apps, and 20gb free)
Not exactly cutting edge, but what it does, it does well.
Absolutely love it. Switch to this from the droid platform. Yes, some apps cost instead of being being free, but they work and my phone hasnt frozen yet. Well worth the money...and I am anti apple out of principle.
The iPhone 4S is essentially a faster, more robust version of the iPhone 4. It does include Siri, but this will be less significant as the iPhone 4 receives this in an update. Siri's abilities are inconsistent, but can be very useful depending on your needs. The phone's battery life is worse than my Motorola Droid 3 which is not only several months older but also runs significant custom software and home layovers that drain battery at a quicker than normal rate. In all, this phone has not sold me on Apple's closed off, overly controlled philosophy but it is lightyears ahead of the Blackberry we were previously using in the office.
I was a die hard android user. My husband talked me into trying the iPhone. I must admit I HATED it for the first week. However, the more I use it the more I like it.
This is the first smartphone I've had and I love it. It is so easy to use - very intuitive. I now use it for nearly everything - managing calendar, emails, reminders, etc. And Siri is an amazing feature. Now I wonder how I ever got along without it!
The phone is an excellent improvement over its predecessor. The camera is better. I use the Siri feature all the time. The processor is fast. I haven't any problems, and with the new software update the battery power is longer, despite what many of the reviews have said.
Thoroughly enjoying my new Iphone 4s. I upgraded from the 1st generation Blkberry Storm...so this is a huge change. All in all, anything I am thinking or trying to do - this phone will do it.
I recently switched to this phone from an older android phone. So far I love this phone! I am able to sync with my MacBook with ease and the new iCloud feature works great. I would recommend this to anyone?
Best iPhone yet. I'm upgrading from a 3GS and this one is a million times faster. The screen makes even 3GS pictures look good. Siri is fun and handy, but needs a little bit of work. Still a great added feature though. I have read a little about bad battery life and so far I can't tell for sure. I'm still using it a lot to get a good feel for how well the battery will perform. Speech to text is very handy too.
I waited five painful years for the iPhone to come to Verizon, then another eight long months for the new 4s model to be released, and I'm so happy I did! The phone is fantastic -- the camera is better than my handheld digital, the Siri ap is a priceless asset to getting through my day, and the convenience and ease (plus Verizon's ability to not have dropped calls) have made the past two weeks the happiest I've had in owning a cell phone. This is the phone worth waiting for, but the wait is over -- get it and enjoy!
First of all let me start by saying iLove the trade-in program at BestBuy. I traded in my 16GB iPhone 4 and received $270 and walked out with a 32GB iPhone 4S. Now the phone, the camera is much improved, takes photos faster, has better facial recognization and focus. Siri is just amazing, didn't think i would use it alot, but such normal tasks as setting the alarm, are now so easy you dont have to thumb thru menu's and scrolls, you just tell her and it's done. The A5 processor seems to make web pages load faster on 3G as well as WiFi. The notifications in iOS5 are simply amazing! The updated GPS sensor makes for more accurate positioning. Battery life is about the same or a tad less than the iPhone4 with "heavy" daily use.
This..... is the most amazing phone i have EVER had. I've owned blackberries and droids, but this is far none, the best phone i have ever owned/used and it's my first iPhone. And i'll tell you what, this phone is absolutely ridiculous!! It's lightning fast on the internet, the apps are super clear and very very quick, the camera audio and picture quality is better than my $400 canon camera.. The call clarity is astounding. There are soooo many features to this phone that it's hard to keep up. The new iPhone 4S is also very easy to use and no doubt, user friendly. I would recommend this phone to anybody looking for a new phone. I give this phone without a doubt, a 10/10.
For the money, not so sure that the Apple Iphone is worth it. I think I can get an android for less money whenever my renewal is up. I thought I had to have an Iphone because everyone raved about them. My droid had similiar features and was less expensive.
Phone is great and I got an Otter case and that really protects it My 3 1/2 mo old great dane tried to chew it and case protected the phone Will see what happens when we are traveiling
I really love this case. I am notorious for forgetting to charge my phone and this case has saved me many times. For those who are curious as to how it functions (my Best Buy associate didn't explain it well), here is my nutshell explanation after using it for a while. The case has a battery in it that can be used to extend the usage of the phone by basically putting the phone into charge mode and feeding power from the case battery as opposed to the wall charger. The case has a connector inside that your phone attaches to which provides the juice from the case. On the case is a switch that is either on or off. In normal operation (both the case and phone are charged), the switch is in the off position and you use the phone like normal. If your battery is almost dead and you are nowhere near a place to charge, what you do is flip the switch on the case. This enables the battery and it starts charging the phone. The entire case battery discharges into the phone giving you almost 90 to 95% charge in about an hour or so. You can use the phone while it is charging, it just simulates being plugged in to the charge cable, but gets its juice from the battery instead of the wall. As soon as you can get back to a place to charge your phone, simply turn the switch off again and plug in the charge cable. It will charge your phone and the internal case battery. Once it is charged up, you can go out and do it again. You don't have to drain both batteries for charging, the internal case battery is there just for a backup in case you are caught without a charger and need that extra time to keep functioning. Like I said, I love this case and it has saved me a few times already. Well worth the $70 I paid for it.. My only complaint is the thickness of the case around the outer edge of the phone causes me some issues getting the buttons to push, but that is minor. I absolutely love the fact that it uses the standard microUSB plug for charging and computer connection instead of being stuck with the apple cable only. I can use any type of microUSB charge station to get my phone charged now.
Its great for keeping your phone from dying, unless you want to continue to use it. The charger doesn't keep up with the energy being used by u surfing on the phone. Other then that it's pretty cool
I love this product. It really extends the use of your iPhone between charges.
I bought this as a gift for my sister, and so far she absolutely loves it. She says it's like having 3x the battery power. I will definitley be purchasing one for myself.
I was looking for this for a long time ago, I used to protect my iphone with apple´s bumpers and carry it in my pocket which was a problem to get the phone when i´m sitting, I had to stand to get the phone out of my pocket. Also i couldn´t carry coins or hard things on that same pocket because of the risk of damaging the iphone. I was looking for something like a case but not bulky to hold the phone on my belt and free my pocket. This works like a charm. It´s lightweight the case is very sleek and good looking. I would recommend to use a screen protector with this case, however, the iphone screen is made with gorilla glass, which is a lot more resistant to scratches than common glass so maybe the screen protectors are just for peace of mind rather than being useful.
I had been looking awhile for a sleek, slim, lightweight case to carry my IPhone 4 after breaking the one that I had previously, which was discontinued at the AT&T Store.. The case is not cheap, but works really well and is definitely worth the cost. IPhones are a little larger than many other cell phones. This case and holster minimizes the bulk or size, by being lightweight and thin, but very durable and has a very pleasant rubbery smooth finish on both the case and holster. I have only had it for a month, but so far I am very pleased with the case. This type is hard to find; I know because I had been looking for weeks before finding this one at Best Buy.
Love this case and clip because it keeps the phone very close to my body and it is the best I have found.
I prefer to have hard cases for my Apple devices, so I went with a brand I have come to trust in protecting my devices, iFrogz. With the case/holster combination, you get a good snap-on case and a holster that doesn't make the phone too large. I like that you can slide the phone in to either leave the face exposed or protected. The only drawback of the design is not being able to easily access the dock connector. So when I use my phone in the car or go to charge it at home, I have to remove it from the holster. A better design would have been to go with smaller braces on the sides, but they would have to be strong or possibly cover the speakers in one position and the headphone jack in the other position. Oh, and the belt clip only rotates 180 degrees, also preventing you from taking advantage of every option for positioning the phone to leave the dock connector exposed but still access most features.
Let's consider this case in two parts: the cradle into which the phone installs, and the cover. The cradle is great, nice feeling texture, not very bulky. For my use, I like it. Now, the cover. It goes on hard, comes off hard. The first time I withdrew the phone from it, it left a scratch on the screen protector. A few minutes later I took it out again, and there was a circular mark on the screen that lined up with the clip's pivot point. Really a terrible product. The idea is good, but it really needs work. If you decide to try one, BE SURE YOU HAVE A SCREEN PROTECTOR ON YOUR PHONE!
The Frogz is too tight case and may need to break-in time before it is comfortable to fit and Stand is very flimsy for iPhone to be secure on the hip or belt
Multifunction Case looks good and keeps my iPhone secure. I have received many compliments from co-workers.
I've always used a belt clip of some kind for any cell phone I've ever had (from my first 2 Nokia's that were the leather pouches, to my Samsung i760 with a snap on belt clip, to my DROID1 Verizon belt clip). This one is by far the sturdiest I have used. The screen goes towards your body while in the belt clip so it doesn't get scratched or damaged. The clip itself, which is usually the first thing to break due to weak plastic, weak hinge, or a weak spring, is amazing on this case. It uses very thick plastic, and the spring shows no sign of wear or weakness from when I originally got it (02-x-2012). The belt clip comes with a two-piece case that goes around the iPhone itself. I'm very happy with it and have dropped the phone a few times and have been quite pleased that nothing broke. It didn't even separate when I dropped it! It doesn't need a head phone adapter, it fits in my car mount (Satechi CR-3600 Universal Car Holder), and I have had no issues using any 3rd party dock extension cables (which I use with my Pioneer radio and some 3rd party chargers). I can't say I've tried using any docks though. The only thing missing would be a built in kick stand, or a built in screen protector....but really, I'm just nitpicking at this point. Overall, very happy with my purchase, and a good price too!
I bought this case because my original case allowed my iPhone 4s to fall out at least 3 times, fortunately without any damage! This case retains my phone well and my phone is easy to access.
Works perfectly to protect my phone so I can keep it with me and listen to music while doing chores.
I only had it for a couple days, but it was cool. Just wasn't for me. I didn't like things hanging on my belt and the case was to bulky for me to have it in my pocket. But for a belt mounted case it's good.
My Seidio belt holster broke right before a business trip. I went to BB looking for a replacement. This is the exact same case that I purchaed from SEIDIO only it was $15 cheaper and no shipping charges. Very slim fit. belt clip broke due to my own fault. I had the other one for 6 mos. w/o incident. would buy again.
Really liked at first until the clip broke within two weeks. I still use the case, it's slim and fits good.
Provides adiqut Protection with a great design. The best part is the screen in clip!
Just purchased, but so far so good. The fit for the phone (iPhone 4S) is really good and the sleeve is lined with felt so it should protect the back from being scratched. Great combination of a protective case that can be used by itself or inserted into the holster. Good feel for the case, but it isn't anti slip. Only possible concern at this point is the wear of the clip holding the phone into the holster.
For a Beginner especially, using this iPhone is a hit or miss process for the first few months. On two small sheets of paper that come in the box are the very basic, yet incomplete instructions that are in small type that needs a magnifying glass to read. Out of frustration I bought an 'iPhone for Dummies' to get to know how the basic functions are done. Apple would do well to offer the User more information on how to use this iPhone, in a well documented, easily readable booklet.
the 4s is much easier to use and the battery lasts longer than my old android. For me this is the perfect phone.
I replaced my thunderbolt with this phone last month, i miss the 4g lte download speeds, but that's about it. Over wi-fi this iPhone 4s is actually faster than the thunderbolt, speedtest app proves that. Camera is 8 megapixel but clearly more advanced than thunderbolt 8 megapixel. I also have macbook and these 2 devices work hand in hand. Its amazing how "things just work". Siri is not bad, it'll be better after the ios6 update in September. Overall great phone, easy to use, can't wait for updates in a couple of months.
Battery life, the battery life is too short and requires several recharging during the day. Nonetheless, great Apple product!
My first iphone and Apple product and it's great. I like that it is so much faster than any phone I have had. Now i just tap on the icon and I connected immediately, I'm doing so much more on my iphone because it's faster, no more waiting minutes and minutes for a connections as on my old phone(I didn't use a lot of the features because it was so slow). Pictures and videos are of great quality, to me this is a fantastic investment. I'm loving Siri !!
This is a great phone and it is easy to use. The apps are great and the camera is the best I've had so far on a phone. Overall it functions well and I am happy with it. The only downside is the durability of it. The first day my husband dropped the phone out of his pocket and the whole back of it shattered like glass. I have dropped every phone I have ever had and I have never seen anything like this before.
I like siri use it all time! Used droids and this Tops them!!!
I enjoy it a lot, it's very very useful for almost anything.
After purchasing (from Verizon Store) and returning 2 NEW Droid Razr Maxx s due to overheating, I purchased my 1st iPhone 4s from BEST Buy. "Hats Off" to BEST Buy Sales Personnel for EXCELLENT Customer Service.
I am really happy with my new phone. I use the calendar function sharing with my husband. We each have our own color with a separate color for shared appointments. This has really simplified our appointment process. iCloud is great. The camera is second to none. I have given up using a separate camera. The video function is also great. The phone is easy to use ( my learning curve was a little long on this function). Siri is finally getting to understand me or is it I am understanding her better?
My first smartphone: Calendar options make for easy appointment creating. Available app possiblites are endless. Meaning I have one to store my grocery list, no more pen/paper. One to help me find the nearest cheapest gas station. The map app helps me find new stores and resturants nearby when I'm in a part of town I don't go to often.
My first smart phone and I love being connected all the time... This makes texting a breeze. Also viewing pictures on the phone is great.. With the old phone the pictures were small and not clear.. It was so bad there was no reason to even send me a picture..
This iPhone has to be the best phone on the market, its easy to use and very fun. I had the iPhone 4 and had to upgrade to the 4S for obvious reasons like Siri (and is she intelligent)! I love my phone so much!
I got my iPhone 4S almost 3 weeks ago after owning a Droid Incredible 2, which I discovered was only incredible at being horrible. So, after numerous visits at Verizon with a few master resets I finally gave up and bought this at full retail price and sold the replacement (Good luck to you, buyer!). Within about 30 minutes, I activated it and set up my iTunes account and it synced all of my apps directly to the device. The second thing I noticed is that it hardly ever gets bogged down; EVER! On the Incredible 2 it was part of the daily routine. Siri is a thousand times better than the voice control function on Android. Plus you can ask her funny questions like, "Who created you?" and she'll give an accurate response. Apps are awesome! There are more apps available on the App Store than Android Market/Google Play. Technically, the only con I can think of is it is limited to only digital content purchased through iTunes; I can't sync the music I purchased on AmazonMP3. But that's not a big deal since I have a Kindle Fire. Everybody, purchase this phone right now! Do not get Android, no matter how good it seems. If you are eligible for an upgrade, I promise you you will not be disappointed if you scroll up and click the 'Buy' button right now!
I simply love it, very stable product. It has all my needs, for devotionals, travels, email, music, readings, radio.... you name it. Extremely convenient.
I was a droid user but switched to the iphone. I especially like the microphone feature for emails and texts.
The processing speed has increased and I personally love using Siri to place phone calls, send texts and answering questions - she's not perfect, but pretty good. I thought the price was still a bit much when all the iPhone competitors are able to offer discounts, but I kept with the iPhone for its increased security measures - eg: they review all apps before entering them into the iTunes store. Also love the "face time" video phone calls when you're near wi-fi spots!
Awesome phone, don't know why it took me so long to switch to the iPhone. Can't wait till the iPhone 5 comes out.
This is my first smart phone. I have had it for a about a month. It's been fun to learn about it's features and the apps are amazing. I'm very happy I made this purchase.
I am new to the world of Smart Phones. iPhone 4S has been a wonderful and seamlessly easily integrating phone. By this I mean it made my transition into the use of Smart Phones very easy. I am glad I picked iPhone 4S as my first pick for a new Smart Phone. I recommend it to anyone who is interested in a new phone. There is an app for literally everything!! I got a great military grade Griffin Case that is very durable and makes the fact that the phone is a drop hazzard a thought that no longer matters. Since I am a big texter, I found a great app, Text Free, that allowed me to remove my text package from my cell carrier and use that for all my texting needs...and it is just what it says=FREE. Free texting is great and it helped me as far as budget is concerned since the difference in the data package I had to add and the text package I deleted was the same amount...so I broke even!
My server is Verizon. The speed is great. I commute into NYC on the train and my work computer does not support any personal sites. I can stay in communication with personal emails, FB, and anything else. I've downloaded a slot machine where the graphics are so good it's like playing the real thing in a casino. I downloaded my daily readings. Taking photos and videos are so easy, much easier than my Droid. Even sliding the lock off to answer the phone is much easier on this. The only thing is Siri. If you think she's going to understand you like she understands the celebrities in the commercial, no way. She's good enough for a robot in a hand held phone! I have never been as happy with any inanimate object as I am with this phone. Oh, and I have no problem with the battery.
I am enjoying the phone to a certain point I think some of the features could improve to make it a little easier to use. I am not impressed with the 3G service through Verizon Network. Overall I like it.. It's like carrying around a mini computer.
TOO MANY WONDERFUL THINGS TO MENTION. HOWEVER THERE ARE A FEW BASIC THINGS THAT REGULAR PHONES DO THAT YOU WOULD THINK THIS PHONE WOULD DO AS WELL. 1, ANNOUNCE CALLERS NAME WHEN RINGING 2.DECLINE A CALL AND SEND A TEXT TO LET THE CALLER KNOW YOU WILL CALL RIGHT BACK (WHILE ITS RINGING). 3. BATTERY LIFE SUCKS!!! 4.DOESNT HAVE SWYPE TO TEXT
5 stars I would recommend this phone to anyone. I have enjoyed using my iphone and love all the apps from the appstore
I switched from an Android to iPhone 4S and couldn't be happier. While the Android was very good I have to rate the iPhone as great. It just simply works better and with the iCloud feature and an accompanying iPad2 I don't often use my desktop PC or my Toshiba laptop but with rare exception. My next purchase will be a MacBook Air. Apple has done an excellent job of integrating their devices and made me a believer. Speed and reliability are hallmarks of Apple in my book. I'm officially sold and would recommend the switch from Android technology to anyone.
I had an iPod Touch, so I thought I knew what to expect from an iPhone, but I got more than I could hope for.
My dream phone is here.. Upgraded from Windows mobile.
Clearly, the features and potential of this phone are phenomenal - great to have iTunes, phone, texts and e-mails on the same device. The sales team at Best Buy was extremely knowledgeable, being able to not only answer questions, but explain the features without being asked. Between Verizon, Best Buy and my teenager, I am becoming an expert. Strongly recommend this phone to anyone who wants / needs a high quality, multi - functional device, who also has the patience to learn how to use it to the full potential.
It is so smart. Love talking Siri. Great pictures. Fine sound. Handy. Still haven't explored all the features to their full extent. Always love Apple products. This is one of its best. Great product. Made my day!
I had resisted trading in my old flip phone for a smart phone for ages because I was just sure I would never be able to master all the ins & outs of the device. And wasn't sure I would even use half the available features. My family and co-workers heckled me relentlessly until I finally made the leap. I originally purchased a Droid Razr but found it to be way too complex for a virgin smart phone user. But thanks to Best Buy's generous exchange policy I traded it for an iPhone 4S a few weeks later. Learning the iPhone was so much easier than the Droid. Wish I hadn't put it off so long. I picked this phone up and within minutes I was hooked. Don't know how I managed without it before. Previously I rarely even texted-mostly because it is a huge pain on a flip phone. But now with Siri's help, I just dictate the text and press send. And I love not having to carry my iPod and a phone. I just transferred my iTunes library to my iPhone and now my music is always with me.Love, love, love it!
This device does everything you could ask of a phone and then some. It is truly a miniature computer with amazing access to the world. It will take a long time to fully realize everything it can do, but it is easy to use from the get go.
My FIRST iphone was not working properly, but after a trip to the Apple store, it was replaced with one that was working!! I am finally beginning to enjoy using it and discover all its' potential.
Unfortunately the phone needs to be charged at least on a daily basis.
Awesome phone. Use it for personal and business. User friendly and easy to learn.
I like the phone, but it has a learning curve. I just don't have the time to train for it. Am getting used to it a little at a time
I am having sooo much fun with this phone. Excellant choice and great service from the staff at the Best Buy at 23/Gratiot - they were ALL so very helpful
i bought this phone for my first smartphone purchase. my teenage son said it was really easy to operate and he was right.i checked prices with verizon and apple and decided to buy it at best buy because of the blacktie protection plan.at $15 a month and no deductible it beat verizons insurance plan..plus a discount if you pay the full 2 years up front..also love the buy back program..for $30 they will buy it back from me in 2 years for $160..that will almost cover my next phone..win-win!
THE IPHONE IS A GOOD PHONE WITH MANY GREAT FEATURES HOWEVER YOU WILL BE LUCKY TO GET THROUGH A DAY WITH THIS HORRIBLE BATTERY IT HAS. I JUST BOUGHT IT LESS THAN ONE WEEK AND I ALREADY HAD TO EXCHANGE IT AND THAT DID NOT MAKE ANY DIFFERNCE. IT STILL SUCKS
Siri is the best. Easy to make phone calls and put in reminders. Have to learn to download apps but will learn soon. Already had a friend purchase the same phone.
I love my iPhone! I had to settle on one with less memory, since the local best buy didn't have the one I wanted, but am still very happy with my purchase. I marked that it's tough/durable only because I bought the Otter Case with it.
Overall I like the iphone 4s. Has a lot of great features.
I have a lot to learn, but this phone is great. Once you get the hang of it , it is quite user freindly. Love the camera and video feature.
It is a very simple and easy phone to use. The only draw back is that it is fragile with glass screen and glass back.
I am really enjoying the iPhone. It does everything that I needed it to do, and more. I am concerned about the rattling noise from the top of the phone, near the camera or on/off switch. I noticed the rattle the first week that I purchased it.
I put off getting a smart phone as long as possible, and I am not normally a huge fan of Apple products. This phone is easy to use, and a great tool for keeping oneself organized and entertained. The scratch resistant glass has held up to coins, keys, one drop on concrete, and a toddler so far without any marring. Siri is a neat application, but it does take some time to use it effectively. I highly recommend downloading WolframAlpha to expand Siri's computational database. Games are intuitive and fun for the most part. Applications work smoothly without crashing, so long as you stick with known application developers. Call quality can get iffy at times, but I believe that is more due to tower placement in an area versus any flaw in the phone design. If you are on the fence as I was and this will be your first phone or first venture into Apple products, you will not be disappointed. Picture quality is phenomenal. The Retina display on the 4S is a more dense pixel count than even the new iPad. My only two complaints are the cost of accessories for iPhones and the battery life. Whether an Apple-branded accessory or third-party, all of the accessories are overpriced as compared to other smart phone manufacturers. A full charge will last a whole day, but be certain to recharge throughout the day if possible and definitely plug in every night.
I am so happy with my new IPhone. I will never own another kind of phone again. The apps are fantastic, the color is superior, the camera is phenomenal. So impressed with the quality, this phone is beyond compare
I absolutely love this phone! I waited forever to buy a smartphone as I knew they would make them better and I didn't want to pay for a data package, but I finally gave up and got one...and now I can't go back. This phone has virtually everything I need. It works great and is useful at work too. The battery life is good, but if GPS location is running at all, it drains pretty fast.
This phone is great! The 4s' camera works really, really well. The touchscreen is great and I have found it MUCH easier to type on this than my larger screened DroidX. All around a better phone and my using it the last couple of months has convinced me to purchase the new iPad that is coming out next week! However, there ARE some caveats that I don't understand Apple not catching: There is no speed dial. You know how you can assign phone numbers to the 0-9 buttons of the phone and one long press dials that number for you? Not available on the iPhone. Every phone in the last 30 years has had this feature and iPhone leaves it off??? Curious. It DOES have a "favorites" list though, and it's "almost" as good. Also, there is no stock voice navigation for the iPhone 4s. It has maps, and can map your destination for you, and follow you as you get there, but there is no voice guidance telling you when to turn. So if you use this as you're driving you'd have to be looking at your phone all the time! Apps are available but decent ones are $50 or more. Android/google phones have voice navigation for free! Siri is a joke. One big marketing hype. There's even a lawsuit being filed because the ads are pretty much blatent lies about Siri's effectiveness. HOWEVER it does have voice dictation which makes entering text and email messages extremely easy. The new Ipad NOT having Siri is a big plus for me. The reception on this phone is not as good as my Driod was... not as good as ANY motorola phone I've ever had. The thing Steve Jobs said about users holdign the phone wrong is true. You can bump up the reception of the phone a couple of notched by holding it towards the bottom of the phone only. weird. All in all, well worth the price with some curious minor (for me) negatives.
I love the iPhone 4s very nice fast would want another for my wife
I have owned the iPhone 4S for a month and LOVE it! It feels solid, has a great screen and everything runs fast!
This phone is so much fun. I just love siri. You can find an app for whatever it is that you want. Phone is easy to use and has great graphics. Easy to multitask with.
I have had other smart phones before this is my first I Phone and I will never use any other phone again. You can do everything with this phone. I use Netflix, Internet and the App store is Amazing. I can't say enough about this phone I never have it out of my hands.
I don't use a lot of the features of the I Phone, but I love the ease of use and how easy it is to learn all the ins and outs of the phone.
I looked at several phones before deciding on the iphone. This phone is so easy to operate and has some awesome apps. I love this phone and am glad I took the plunge and upgraded to a smartphone. I read the reviews which seemed to all have battery issues. I use my phone an average amount and the battery has never gone below 50% after a days usage. I plug it in every night and it's ready to go when I wake up. I have had my phone for a month now and keep finding new ways to make it work for me. It is very handy.
I don't care if this does sound like a plug for Apple products, this is the best smartphone available at this time. I have had the misfortune of owning an Android phone as well as using Blackberries in the recent past. The iPhone blows them all away in every area. I do not have the frequent crashes/reboots, bluetooth issues, slowness/unresponsiveness issues, uninitiated calls out the blue, etc. that I had with the Android phone. The iPhone is far more versatile than a Blackberry. I know that no phone is absolutely perfect or not without some issues, but the iPhone so far has lived up to the hype. I am very happy with it and will recommend it to everyone I can. The only real issue is with the price. While I don't believe the 16GB is too high at $199, to move up to 32GB is another $100, and to move up to 64GB is yet another $100. The 32GB should be $250, and the 64GB should be $300, at the most. It simply does not cost Apple or anybody else that much for the added RAM, in my opinion.
The Apple iphone 4s, is so much more than just a phone. It is the gold standard that all will try to imulate.
This phone has been better than I expected. I moved up from the old-school non-smart phone to the iPhone 4s. I could not be happier with my purchase.
I have owned two Droid phones before making the best switch of my life. Everyone should own an iPhone. It is superior in processing power, functionality, user experience, clear screen, apps and everything else. The only thing at all I would change is the ability to make the receiver louder.
My Dad and I went in for the iPhone4s for my sister. She has a horrible habit of texting and driving. Dad has a Motorola Droid 2 that is suppose to have text to speech abilities but is too hard to figure out. and really none of the phone are so user easy to use. She is not a tech geek. Dad and myself yes not here. It has been a month and she is having more fun with that phone. She was complaining the other day about waisting the morning away browsing the app store. Seri is just her best friend, i guess. For someone who is not big into electronics, has had other smart phones. The Apple iPhone is a big hit. user friendly.
I have been a Blackberry user for a long time and never thought I would switch to a iPhone. Well, when the BB crashed I had a decision to make. After hearing many people talk about how they loved the iPhone I thought I would give it a try....My only questions is why did it take me so long... On to the phone review.... SIRI - Ease of use is outstanding, Siri works great as I am driving to write emails or to call someone. It takes a little getting used too but once you get the hang of it you will like it. I found it to work very well with a blue-tooth headset as is seems to understand my words more clearer with less mistakes. Battery - You need to make sure that you are closing out all programs running in the back ground or you will find your battery will not last an 8 hour day, also turn off the WI-FI if you don't need it as this will wear your battery down with-in 2-4 hours. I had to have my 10 yr old show me how to close out the programs since she has a iPod Touch so I will share it with you in case your not sure how to close everything. Once at your main menu push the "menu, main whatever you want to call it button" twice real fast, all your icons will move up and across the bottom it will show you all the programs you have running. Put your finger on just 1 icon and hold it there until you get a negative symbol (about 2 seconds) one each icon, at that point touch each icon that you want to close, once they close they will disappear....Trust me, it does not delete the program or icon off the phone, unless you do this in the main screen then it will.... Speaker/Talking - I find if I am not on my head-set that I need to hold the phone directly to my mouth or the other caller cannot hear me. I have been told several time that it just sounds like I hung up on the other caller when in reality all I did is move the phone away from my mouth. There is a plus to this and that is the noise cancellation works great and people cannot hear what is going on around you. Video's and picture quality are out standing. I have some of the most amazing videos and pictures from my Central America trip just 4 days after I purchased this phone. When I show my pictures people think I took them with some big expensive camera and are blown away when I say that is just from the iPhone. Overall, I really love my iPhone, yes, it has some issue that you learn to deal with just like everything else in the world but the positives out weigh the negatives far more...
Had Android that was OK but wanted to have device that worked smoothly with iPad, Touch 4G and my Macbook Pro. Apps synced smoothly as did music and photos - Concerned about smaller screen but resolution makes up the difference. The best feature of the 4S-- Battery life is much better than anything I've ever had. The courtesy and skill of the BB staff moving contacts and photos made it painless-- Thanks for a pleasurable experience!!
couldn't be more pleased with my iphone works great and the service was great.
For the majority of the time that I have used cellular telephones, I always used an every day, simple-minded phone. Seeing nearly all of my peers with these so-called smartphones eventually tempted me into buying one for myself. This past summer, I asked some of my friends that owned smartphones their opinions on the nifty pieces of equipment; some owned iPhone's while others used Android phones. I eventually made the decision to purchase the iPhone 4 (latest model at the time), mainly because I was already adjusted to the layout having previously owned an iPod Touch. Everything on this miniature Mac is laid out with simplicity. From the settings folder to the "App Store," everything may be accessed with the tap of a finger on the ultra-smooth heat-sensitive screen, and browsed through with a simple flick. The only drawback to this phone, that I have come across, is how fragile it is. With one drop, you may end up with a shattered screen. First and foremost, this phone looks great. I bought the black version, and it is extremely sleek. This phone not only has a great look to it, but it also has a great feel to it. The rectangular, box-like shape fits right into your hand. The iPhone 4 also has a good weight to it. It is not too light to where it feels like a feather in your hand, but it also does not feel like a brick. Apps, apps, apps, and more apps. Did I mention this phone has a plethora of apps? Need an app for something? Well, you are probably in luck because my guess is that Apple's virtual store probably has something to satisfy your needs. Thousands and thousands of games make this phone great for passing time or playing against friends. One of my favorite games is the extremely popular "Temple Run." In this game, you must jump and slide in order to avoid obstacles and to collect coins. Also, the apps made available through the iPhone 4 gives the opportunity to eliminate numerous items from an every day life. No need anymore for a GPS system, magazines, or phonebooks. Even many popular newspapers are now made available with a little searching. I have the ability to check the weather, scores of sports games, my to-do list, and much more with the tap of a finger. My favorite feature of the iPhone definitely is having access to Google whenever I want. Granted, every smartphone has access to a browser, but Google seems to be the most convenient capability offered by my phone. Countless times in conversations will random questions pop up that no one knows the answers to, so now I can just Google it. "What year did they win the championship?" "What album was this song on?" The answers are now in the palm of my hand. If you are clumsy like I am, it would be a wise choice to buy a case for protection against drops and spills. At first, I was weary of buying such a fragile device due to my history of accidents with cell phones. I purchased an Otter Box Defender Series case immediately after receiving my phone, and it turned out to be a great decision. I drop my phone every once in a while and have yet to blemish my actual phone. If someone asked me if they should get an iPhone 4, I would definitely say yes. This phone is so modern and sophisticated. It loads webpages super quick, and it downloads applications lightning fast. The battery outlasts almost all other smartphones and recharges quite rapidly. The iPhone 4 has everything you could possibly need in a phone. I am so pleased with this product that I will now be a lifelong Apple consumer.
Went from a Blackberry to the I Phone, should have done it a long time ago.
Let me start off by saying that I am very tech savy. I've had a couple of Blackberry's and a Droid's before, but no other phone that I have ever had will EVER compare to my iPhone 4S!!! This phone is so user friendly that I would recommend it to ANYONE even someone who doesn't know how to use technology. Its set up was a breeze and its extremely easy to use. I love all of the apps and different features that it comes with. I will NEVER go to any other phone besides an iPhone now!
Great product...It's a must have phone..apple is on top of its game
Waited for years to get a smart phone thinking I really didn't need to spend extra money on data pkg. Then finally decided to spoil myself and bought an iPhone. Can't believe I waited so long!!!!!!!!! Best purchase I ever made. Soooo easy to use. Have had no problem with battery life. Happy Happy Happy.
First - the new iPhone is great, lives up to my expectations and more. My 4 star rating is based on what an awful shopping experience I had trying to get it through BestBuy. I love BestBuy and have had many great shopping experiences there, but this was a nightmare, at three different BestBuy stores. Now - on to the phone. I love Siri and feel the upgrade from my iPhone 3 was a big improvement. The battery runs out far too fast, but I got the Mophie - Juice Pack Air Charging Case a few days later and now never have to worry about battery life.
great device! reall user friendly, a good buy for the everyday user!
Easy to use, perfect for the less tech savvy smartphone user.
The four star rating should probably be 4-and-a-half. To start with the bad: I have not found a use for Siri, the much advertised 'personal assistant' feature. She answers every time I bend over if the phone is in its usual place in my front pocket, but doesn't in the few instances I've tried to use the feature. This all may be my clumsiness. On the other hand, the rest of the iPhone 4S is wonderful. My last phone was an iPhone 3G, and I am delighted with many of the improvements. I have lost none of the functionality of apps, and there is much added. The camera alone is worth changing for: the HD movies are excellent, even in mediocre lighting conditions; the FaceTime option is great (though I have used it only once thus far), and the optics of the still-shot camera continue to impress me: there is no need to take a camera traveling any more! The phone quality is very good, and my wife (who switched from a Samsung) has had none of the problems she had with the keyboards on her last two phones. Our children, now in their twenties, used to laugh at her attempts--now she not only texts them reliably, but also she has even used the phone as a primary email device on a recent trip we took together, leaving me as the only one needing to lug a computer around. Overall, well done.
Love the ease if use and functions the phone offers. As a heads up to all who purchase the phone, if you find your battery is not lasting the day here is the trick. The phone is searching for data all the time and part of the reason I bought the phone was bc programs weren't suppose to be running in the background. But they do!! So you need to hit the square return button twice when your on your homepage. A bottom screen will show with every application you ever used. Hold down on one of those apps for about 2 seconds then hit the red button in the corner to eliminate those and save your battery usage.
This phone does everything that is advertised and more.
I had a Droid X for over a year and loved it, the IPhone is a very good phone it is less buggy then the Droids but I like the Droid better because you can do more when it is Rooted. I got the iPhone because i have all Apple computers and iPads so it just made sense to me. done get me wrong i am not talking bad about the iPhone i just like the droid better
I got this phone for my wife for XMas, and she hasn't been able to put it down!
phone is easy to use, still learning apps, etc. woudl recommend
I love this phone, it's fast and after using SIRI for a little while, I can get about 95% voice to text results. Makes it really easy to text responses and e-mails. The camera is incredible absolutely great pics and movies. I have mine through Verizon who will unlock the SIM card for free so I can use it in other countries by purchasing a local SIM. Sprint said they would however, could not and said they have no plans of ever unlocking the SIM. So back to Verizon I went, used the phone in Hong Kong and Macau without any problems. Great voice, it exceeded my expectations and continues to do so.
I have used several phones over the years (For work & home) but this Apple 4S is by far the BEST, Thanks Best buy
The first phone I got, after waiting one month, I couldn't view pics or listen to my iTunes on it. Apps didn't load. I took it back to Best Buy, and they were nice, but told me to return home and "restore" it on my computer. I did, and nothing improved. I returned to the store, and they ordered me another...it came in after a week and a half. I am very happy with this one. Everything works, and I am having lots of fun with it. The phone also works right. Guess I got a dud the first time.
I love the iphone. This phone allows me to do everything I need to do for work, while also giving me great apps that let me keep up with my family's variuous fire/EMS shifts, add captions to pictures and share them with my friends, track my calories and exercise, and so much more. This is the phone to have if you want to stay connected and enjoy great options for apps!
I've drunk the koolaid. It tastes good.Take me to your leader.
I have had several Droid phones and I will never go back. This was purchased for my wife. It is a great phone with great features. However, I do not think the extra features of the 4s are enough to make me switch from my normal iPhone 4. If you are looking for a new phone I would pick an iPhone 4 (to save money) or the iPhone 4s. This is the Cadillac of phones
I reALLY DO LIKE IT...AND i'M SURE ONCE i GET THE HANG OF IT WILL EVEN LOVE IT MORE....i'M TRYING TO JUST LEARN A FEW THINGS AT A TIME..SO i CAN ACTUALLY REMEMBER
I love most of the features on my iPhone 4s, but the battery life is terrible!! I have to recharge my phone at least three times a day. I did the update that was promised to fix the issue and, if anything, it made it worse! Apple needs to do something to fix this issue immediately!!
After 2 years on Droids, I came back to Apple. Love the phone! Hard to beat interface and operations. Service at Westfield, IN Best Buy store was great, thank you.
I love this phone except for the battery life :( great service !
I had the iPhone 4 for only a few months when I moved up to the 4s. Not too different, but love Siri!!!
The Apple iPhone 4s is smooth and works for you not against you. Love the iCloud. Photo's look good on phone but not quite as good when enlarged on computer. The focus on camera is super fast and haven't missed any desired pictures. I think the voice phone quality is excellent, much better than my old LG phone. The iPhone looks great but why did Apple use glass for the back? I feel like I have to carry it in a vault to protect it. Battery life is short, the IOS 5.01 update didn't change anything for me.
Battery could be better. can't upload photos from camera roll to facebook. alot of limited funtions.
There is a reason that 84% of iPhone users stay with the iPhone on there next upgrade. The technology in this is beyond any other phone. If your looking at the new galaxy nexus phone by samsung don't! That is the cheapest looking phone. The screen is bigger because apple knows that if theirs gets any bigger it would lose resolution and feel. The help at best buy was great. I was told at Verizon that the fastest way was to order a phone that wouldn't come for three weeks. So I called best buy and they had them in stock. Even though their system was down I was done in a half an hour. She set it up and transferred my contacts like that. You need this phone!
Love this phone. I resisted buying a smart phone for years for fear it would be smarter than I am, but I gotta say, this phone is so intuitive to use that I've never needed to read instructions for it. I looked at many Droid phones before settling on this iphone and chose it primarily for its fabulous picture-taking. Many phones boast 8 megapixels, but this phone camera had more clarity than any others I'd seen--and the icloud feature automatically backs up any pics I take to my computer! No dropped calls, sound clarity is fantastic, battery lasts throughout the day, Siri is wonderful--this is just an all-around super phone. Why did I wait so long to venture into the world of smart phones? Maybe cause I'm a grandma who remembers the days when there were NO cell phones at all!
Great camera and speed upgrades! I upgraded from my 2+ year old 3GS and this is a great phone!
More than impressed with Siri . She works better if there's no external noise. By the way this review was entered using the IPhone 4s. The only thing I don't like is the keyboard always shows capital letters. Wish it showed lower case. The update really increases battery life.
I'm still new to this item, so far, enjoying it immensly. Probably have much more to learn about using the internet on this phone.
For many years of my life, I have been using half a dozen products. * Cell Phone * GPS Navigation * iPod Touch * DVD Player * Digital Camera * Digital Camcorder The iPhone 4S is all of those products (plus many more) all wrapped up into one, so let's dive right in, shall we? 1. Cell Phone -- The call quality is incredible. I'll never forget the first phone call I made (from my car) listening to the incredible sound clarity of the call. Also, it has the new Bluetooth 4.0 technology and integrates with my vehicle Bluetooth perfectly. In fact, when I use the voice-activated "Siri Personal Assistant", I speak to my car (not the phone) and Siri understands me. The included earphones includes the speaker, so you can use it hands-free while on the go. 2. GPS Navigation -- With an optional vehicle mount, this will function with the right (optional) application (app). Combined with Siri voice control, this device exceeds my expectations of what to expect from a GPS navigation system. 3. iPod Touch -- The iPhone does everything the iPod Touch can do many times better with a much faster A5 dual-core processor. From listening to your music, to photos, to videos, to web browsing and everything else, you really can carry less and have more. 4. DVD Player -- with the optional A/V adapter combined with an HDMI cable, this has replaced my BlueRay Player for full DVD functionality for a full 1080P HD experience. Popcorn not included. 5. Digital Camera -- Oh sure, it does not have a mega-zoom lens, but it certainly has 8 megapixels, improved sensor for low-light photography, HDR photo technology and when combined with the (optional) Photo stream service with iCloud integration, all photos taken can instantly sync with all of your other Apple devices. With this wireless integration, it also replaces memory cards and those dreadful adapters! Did I mention that it includes two cameras? 6. Digital Camcorder -- Make no mistake about it, this camcorder can record a full 1080P HD video at 30 Frames-Per-Second. With two cameras, there are more opportunities than ever! Now you would think with all of those features, that would be the limit, but truth be told -- there are no limits to what you can do. With the incredible App store, you can purchase additional apps. In fact, many fine apps are actually free of charge. With the wonderful Siri personal assistant, just speak in natural language to do many tasks. Need an alarm clock? Just ask, "Siri, wake me up at 5:30 AM tomorrow". Need an oven timer? Just ask, "Siri, set the timer for 20 minutes". The possibilities are endless with what you can do. This product is just incredible and if you are shopping for someone, looking for a gift, if they already own one, there are dozens of fine accessories that would make affordable gifts, because most people will purchase this long before the holidays.

After using Blackberry phones for four years, I decided it was time for an upgrade. I researched all the Android models and they all came up short compared to the iPhone 4s, in terms of speed, sheer reliability, and smooth user interface. Add Siri and iCloud and the near flawless design on the iPhone and I was sold. Good Crackberry and Hello Apple!
Returned my iPhone 4S 32GB after going to apple tech phone line and the store 6 times! The store was useless they just want to give you someone else's rebuilt phone! Until they admit to problem and fix it, I wouldn't waste your money!
Purchased Otterbox defender and Zagg HD shield to protect phone. The iPhone is amazing. Siri makes everything easy!
Bought this for my son for his 14th birthday. It's the 4th iPhone in the house...need I say more?
Faster, better picture quality than my 3S. Underimpressed with Siri though, not nearly as intelligent as Apple would have us believe.
So far a good phone and has been fairly easy when switching from Android to Apple - the verdict is still out as to which is better; they both have good qualities.
I came to the iPhone 4S from the Android Motorola Droid X really really wanting to love this phone. I enjoyed right off the bat how easy the phone was to set up and get done basic tasks, but within a week I was already feeling the limitations. I hated the contact manager. Apple designed it a certain way, and if you don't like Apple's way, well too bad, they wont let developers write apps that replace key functionality items like the contact manager. The lack of basic GPS routing application similar to Google Maps is a major downside for me as well. Sure, you can see a route on the map, but turn by turn directions would be nice as is standard on Android. I also was quite upset that only music and media present in iTunes could be imported to my phone. With android it was always as simple as drag and drop into a mounted file folder or SD card. The final straw for me was the lack of an SD card and the media issues (importing MP3s downloaded from various websites to be used as ringtones is a perfect example) was ultimately a deal breaker. I kept my iPhone for a total of 3 weeks and returned it for a Samsung Galaxy S3 and could not be happier! Sure I didn't get all I wanted with the stock apps on the Galaxy either, but gloriously, Android allowed me to download 3rd party apps to make the experience all that I wanted it to be.
Perfect phone all around. Well worth the money. This is a very dependable phone
being a newbie to the technology of smart phone..i was very happy and surprised that it's so easy to navigate and use. i know there are many more things that i can do with it..just a matter of finding some direction from my kids and the iphone dummies i downloaded. love it!
For someone that has an iPad and up iMac computer this is a great asset! Everything syncs together and works very smoothly. If Mac would just build a touch screen laptop I'd be set!
Was just what I was looking for, didn't think the money was worth it for the iPhone 5 but with the price down on the 4S thought it was a great phone for the money. Only thing is the blue tooth comparability with items, we use a blue tooth printer and scanner at work and will not work with the iPhones ,
I wanted to get i phone5.IT was not available.I was told i could return it to get i phone 5 , and i phone 4S was available. I visited the store 3 times to try to get i phone5 with out luck. Now the window of one month is over. Let me know if you can help in any way?
Have to recharge more often than my previous phone (IPhone 4).
I really like the phone over all. I am disapointed in the battery life and the charger didn't work after 6 weeks. The charger has no warranty!
I don't know what I did without Siri. I can not only have her remind me of things that need to be done, but she can text for me and read me my incoming texts.
My family Loves the IPhones!! Recommend them to everyone!
Omg, I should've got this phone when it first came out. I've been using android for which seems like forever compared to the 4s. Everything works smoothly and I haven't had to reboot, reset, or anything to this phone. Goodbye android for good!
Love the phone, not carzy about Verizon but the phone is great. I am still learning all the tricks you can do with the iPhone. But all in all it is a really good phone
I bought this phone because I am used to Apple products and I was afraid to go with the android system. What a mistake. The reception on this phone stinks. I have been into the store multiple times and I just got off the phone with customer service again. Customer service tried to troubleshoot over the phone and now my iPhone is even worse than it was before he did the troubleshoot. I have had nothing but trouble since day one. Do not buy the iPhone. It is not worth the money. I also have 2 family members with the same exact problems and I have informed Verizon about this.
Nice style, thin and slick buttons. Thought it was going to be hard to get use to all the different features but it was not. Not really a computer person but this is easy
She loves the phone and can't understand why she waited so long to obtain it. the features are great; the phone just is a great new purchase
Great Phone! I love iPhones more than Androids. The only downside is that the iPod app does not work very will with my car stereo.
I was looking into a case that was smaller and less bulky. But this case offers little to no protections against accidental drop phone. Also its not worth the price I paid for a piece of thin plastic...
I've been meaning to get a new iPhone case for a bit now, my other one broke after 6+ months of use. I saw that Best Buy had Hello Kitty ones, so i went to check them out online first. I read the review, and thought nothing of it. The next day I bought this case and was immediately dissatisfied. It doesn't fit properly; it always seemed like the left part wasn't all the way snapped on. And not even after 5 days of use, the small plastic bar, the one that encloses the part where your volume up & down buttons are, snapped off. Poor quality. Returned it & got a different case.
I've been looking for a hard cover Hello Kitty case for my iPhone 4 for a while now, so when I saw this at Best Buy, I just had to get it. When I opened the package, I was disappointed. The fit isn't so good and I had to force my phone into it to put it on. It wasn't worth the money at all. And it hurts to give this product a bad review because I'm a HUGE Hello Kitty fan.
I got this case on 8/17/12 and by 8/20/12 it had broke. It didn't fit the phone very well and as a previous reviewer stated the plastic by the volume buttons broke. When I tried to take the case off, it broke in three more places. This was not worth the money and am very disappointed because I love Hello Kitty.
This is a good durable case that is not too bulky.
lightning fast and durable, great price. it's basicly new iphone except cheaper
Great refurb phone. Why pay full price? Does everything an iPhone 4 does for a fraction of the cost.
Very nice refurbished cellphone. No sign of usage, but the battery life seems shorter than brand new one. One year warrany from Best Buy. Iphone 4 has a decent screen, but speed is already out-of-date. Apple design and upgrade apps for iphone 4s, since then iphone 4 becomes slow. After the release of next generation of iphone and ipad, you will feel the speed of iphone 4 similar as iphone 3 now. But overally if you decide to buy a iphone 4, then this refurbished one would give you similar experience as a brand new iphone 4
Worked only for 25 days. Screen became black and I was unable to reset the phone. Waited till battery died. Then returned and purchased new
Don't need to review the product.. but man, for 30bucks? Best Buy really caught my attention.. I bought it within an hour of seeing it on the site.
We upgraded the kids phones to iphones. I didn't want to spend alot of money to the refurbed phones were a great answer. The phones are like new and we have had no issues at all. I would buy refurbed phones again.
Went in to purchase a new iPhone 4 and was told about the refurbished one for ONLY $30. Since I get the black tie protection anyway...why not! Haven't had a bit of problem with it.
I purchased this item & you cannot speak to anyone on speaker phone because the microphone has never worked. The screen also has some technical difficulties where the screen flickers like a strobe light. I will be returning the phone.
Never knew what all the big buzz was about regarding the IPhone and thought it was a waste of money. Now I understand!!! Great product.
This is an excellent smartphone. I have no reservations whatsoever in recommending this product to others!
I selected the refurbished IPhone4 to replace my refurbished IPhone 3. I had excellent results with the 3 but after 2 years I felt it was time to upgrade. The IPhone 4 isn't much different than the 3 and that's another reason for the 4; no new learning curve.
I debated for weeks before buying, wary of the "refurbished" title. Finally decided I couldn't beat the price for the technology. Can't tell the difference between this and the one my fiancé spent hundreds on. I got the Geek Squad Black Tie Protection so im not worried even if it gives me problems down the line. But Works like a charm, not glitchy, and is now my lifeline. With this, I don't need a GPS, computer, iPod, calculator, calendar, etc. There is nothing you can't do with this phone, and it's so easy to use that techies and newbies alike will get their money's worth and then some. Jump on the iPhone bandwagon. It's popular for a reason!
First of all, I paid 30 bucks for my iphone 4 16GB, who does that, pretty much no one but me thanks to my awesome customer service rep! He was so funny and so nice. Back to the actual thing I'm reviewing, my iPhone is the best thing I have ever put in my hand. I bought the refurbished phone and have had absolutely no problems with it, and it looked and functioned like it had never been taken out of a box. I was skeptical of the iPhone but now that I have one I will probably never change phones unless someone creates something better than Apple products. My phone does everything I have ever wanted in a phone. Get rid of your GPS, get rid of your iPod, get rid of video games, get an iPhone, it can do all of that plus some and it's beyond simple to understand and use. I mean my 80+ year old grandparents both have iPhones if that says anything.
I bought this case with the bundle when we upgraded. I am not very hard on phones so I didn't need to get the most expensive case there was. I found that this case isn't bulky and it doesn't look cheap. The only bad thing about it is that if you do drop it on the concrete, it will scrape. It was a simple drop and I got 4 sizable scrapes on the corners. I can't complain too much since it didn't shatter my glass. Overall it does the job of protecting what it's covering. It just may have a few more battle scars
I was looking for a case that was not as bulky as otter boxes but would still offer some moderate protection. I have never dropped a phone, but wanted that :just in case" security. The only choices of colors was blue or brick red. Wish there were more choices of color.
Looks good and fits well, Good protection. have dropped phone more than once without problems, Easy to install
This product is excellent for protecting your I-Phone 4 against dropping or normal day-to-day wear. Unfortunately for some reason the car charger will not stay plugged in due to design.
I bought this case recently as I needed a new case for my iPhone 4. A few days into having the case, I went to the pool and touched the case a few times while my hands were still wet. The paint immediately started bubbling and peeling off, and has been falling off in flakes since then. Definitely not worth the money. Don't bother.
This is a 5 STARS PLUS item. I will and have already recommended it to others.
I use my iphone 4 extensively for GPS applications such as Geocaching, SkyDroid (for Golf) etc. The iphone 4 battery last a lot longer than the iphone 3 battery but would still not last more than 2 to 3 hours of continuous GPS use. So after doing a lot of research I decided on the Mophie Juice Pack Plus and was very impressed. Fits great and looks great. I did not even perform a charge on it before using it on a golf outing that lasted 6 hours and the battery never went down at all!!!
i love this case because it is camo and i hunt i also love this case because it is very potective
GREAT PHONE JUST WISH IT WAS NOT SUCH A PAIN TO DOWNLOAD MUSIC . AND DIFFERENT TONES OH AND SCREEN WAS A BIT LARGER
I have always been opposed to getting an iPhone since it came out because of the whole issue of not displaying flash. I actually got this phone for my wife as her birthday present. Once I got it, I started checking out the features and I must say, I am very impressed with how long Apple has come from the first iPhone that was released. I have always been an Apple person and now that I know that the iPhone is as good as it is right now, I am definitely getting one when my contract is up for renewal. The best part about it is how this phone, along with all the other Apple products integrate with each other.
I love my iPhone 4S. I upgraded from a BlackBerry and am totally hooked to the iPhone. I thought the transition from BlackBerry to iPhone would be hard, but it wasn't. The touch keyboard was a little hard getting use to, but once you get the hang of it, you can type fast like with a regular qwerty keyboard. I love the many apps I can get. Downloading is fast. I just wish that group text replies where private like on my old BlackBerry. On the iPhone, the whole group can see your replies, so if you want privacy, you can't do group text. But that's no big deal. If you want privacy, just text individually even if it is the same text message. I just copy & paste to everyone individually so that the replies can come just to me & no one else. I love my iPhone. I have no regrets.
I have been waiting to purchase the iPhone ever since Sprint started offering them. I was a previous blackberry owner before I made the switch. I thought I had a smartphone with the blackberry, that is until i picked up my new iPhone. Very easy ot set up and it is like a mini-computer in my hand.
I got this phone because my wife has been wanting an iPhone for a long time. She had an Android phone prior, and was really excited to get this phone. She used it for awhile and the network was really slow!! It seemed even slower than when she used her Android. She totally fell in love with Siri!!!! Problem was, Siri was horrible when on our carrier network. And after awhile she missed her big Android screen, widgets, her Google Play Music app, and being able to customize her phone more. The iPhone 4S is a really great phone, but it turned out to not be what she really wanted. We took it back and got a Samsung Galaxy S III. We are really enjoying that now, and only missing Siri!
Great phone! I like it and I have had it for about a month now and has been pretty good to me
Overall this seems to be a great phone. It is very fast online and fairly simple to navigate.
If you don't own one, go get one. The phone anticipates what I would like to get done.
My previous 2 phones were androids and, well, like most androids they let me down. So eventually I received my iPhone as a gift. I have to say this phone is great. This phone is faster than any android. The operating system is better. The phone is better overall. All I have to say is that I'm an apple fanboy now.
I was reluctant to give up my android phone but gave in to reviews and decided to give this phone a try. It has a few more bells and whistles than the Android phone I had. It seems to work smoother and faster. The battery lasts twice as long compared to the Android phone I had. The phone could be damaged very easily so plan to spend the extra money and get a really good protective case. It has an awesome camera and linked to iCloud it's even better. It also seems to pick up a signal where my Android didn't.
I love this phone, won't go back to a droid ever again!
I'm not very technologically gifted but this phone is incredibly easy to understand and set up. If you are going to buy this product youve got to order the model with Siri. Jetsons anyone?
I love my iPhone, I can have my phone, music and all my apps on one device and I'm also able to save and update my info through my iTunes account, I will never have to worry about losing any of my contacts or pictures again.
The phone is very intuitive, but the battery life is a serious problem.
I had thought about just buying a droid phone with my upgrade, but decided to splurge on the Iphone. I am so glad I did. I love the I cloud feature also.
I've bought 6 phones plus tvs and other items from Best Buy. When I purchased the iPhone I had your people install the shield. When I reviewed my invoice I noticed I was charged for this. I was never charged a fee in the past. I should have been told at time of purchase. It was my mistake for not seeing it on my receipt . I'll have to be more careful at best buy from now on
Purchased to replace my teenage daughters Blackberry. She loves it. No problems with phone or service.
My first Apple iPhone 4 I purchased 6 months ago. Loved it but really wanted Siri. I purchased my second iPhone 4s 16gb one month later. Gave my other iPhone 4 to my daughter. I have not regretted the purchase at all. My daughter says she has had problems with the iPhone 4 but I never did. iPhone 4s is one of the best phones I have ever owned. Make sure to buy a case with it for the protection of being dropped. And definatly buy the black tie protection through Best Buy. It may be a little more expensive but well worth it.
The iPhone 4S certainly doesn't need my review in order to tell you it's great. A legion of fans does that pretty effectively. This being my first iPhone, however, lets me confirm to myself how wonderful it really is. Everything from the sleek metal case to the crystal clear display (seriously, I didn't know my eyes could even see things that sharp!) represent one of the finest designed, and most elegant, products I've ever held in my hand. The interface is logical, slick, and plenty fast for my needs. So far, the apps I've downloaded have all worked well, from camera apps, to games, to a Bible reader, and much in between. After hearing all the positive vibes surrounding the iPhone pretty much since it was released, to have one now in my hands is indeed a revelation. And I haven't even mentioned how much I love this camera... I will say the battery life could be improved.
The iPhone4 is real easy to use and has a lot of options.
My first Smart phone, and i love it.. Haven't really found anything I don't like..Easy to use. I would recommend this to a beginner like me..
Physical Attributes: o This device is too thin, as it seems too easy to be dropped. o Glass is not a practical for this device. o Display size should have been 3.75" to 4". o Function buttons & the data port are located in optimal areas. o Apple's connector is too bulky. o This device is beautiful, but fragile! An Otterbox Defender case or Griffin Survivor case is an absolute necessity. Operational Attributes: o The processing power is far superior of any device I have ever used/owned! The responsiveness of the fluid interface & menu operations is smooth & fast. o I hate virtual keyboards. But this keyboard works much better than any other virtual keyboard. It is almost as easy to work with as a physical keyboard. o The 8mp camera is absolutely amazing! It takes high quality pics & snaps them fast. o Reception is great. This is most likely due to the fact this device is not running Verizon software. o Customization options of this device are great. The ability to determine which apps can use push-notifications improves performance & battery life. This also helps control data usage too. o Siri is definitely beta. It is obvious that Siri has much more limitations that one would first think. o The speakers leave much to be desired if you are playing your music over the speakers. Do not plan on being impressed or you will be disappointed. o Apple = No Flash. If you do not plan on using this device as a primary device for internet browsing, then this should not be a deal-breaker. Battery life: o Battery life is great! I can usually get two days easy on a full charge, but I don't "play" with my device 12 hours a day either. o The recharge time for this device is faster than anything I have ever seen. Conclusion: I have had my iPhone 4s for 2.5 months now. But if I had to redo my purchase decision again I would buy it again. As long as you get a good protective case & take care of it, it is an awesome device. I have not experienced any freeze-ups or hang-ups. The battery life & the processing power of this device makes up in part for the bad design of this device. The lack of a physical keyboard kept me buying android phones for a long time, but the constant Android problems, like freeze-ups made me want to give the iPhone a try. And now, I am very glad I did.
Used the EVO 4G for 2 yrs with a variety of problems with hardware & software issues starting from day 1. This is a huge step up from the EVO. NO problems so far.
First, I must mention that Siri is a nice feature but is not efficient as I had hoped and with Sprint's network sometimes tends to lag when using 3g to download data. However, the A5 processor is incredible and can multitask apps with ease. The iSight camera is works well. The 8 megapixel camera is great and is better than you would expect from a smartphone camera. iOS is a incredible operating system, the notification center, iMessage, reminders, and iCloud are some of the best features in the market. The battery is pretty decent but beware of apps that are being run in the background they can kill the battery.
I love having the option of so many popular apps! I've found apps that are compatible with my phone that help me with my finances, fitness, as well as just fun game type apps. Its seems like almost every popular app is compatible with this phone. Another benefit I've found from this phone is that is syncs better with my Macbook than my previous phone (a Blackberry). I don't want to spend hours trying to make sure that my important information is backed up, so having a compatible phone and computer was essential to me when making my purchasing decision. I appreciate its simplicity and ease of use. The only thing I've found difficult to adjust to is the small touch screen keyboard. I find I rely heavily on the auto correct when I text. Maybe if you've already used a touch screen for typing it would be easier to master the iPhone keyboard.
Not as fast as I had hoped and Siri could be better at being available, but over all I really like my iPhone 4s. I have had Blackberries for about 4 years and love them, but I wanted more freedom with surfing and apps. I am quite surprised at how easy the touch screen is to type on (and I have not had a "D@mn you autocorrect" moment yet). I have had the phone about a month and I would recommend it to others. Battery life is not great, but there are products that help to overcome that issue.
I'm so happy with my new iPhone. I've told co-workers to get the iPhone when it's time to get a new phone.
Good bye android. How did I survive without this phone? Love it. Siri is not what she was hyped up to be. But so what? It's fast and has storage. Great phone. I was a skeptic. No regrets. Should have done it sooner
love My phone however I would have done things a little different. The phone is great but goes through battery power pretty quick. Wtih HEAVY usage I am charging it 2-3 times in 24 hours. Normal usage 1 time every 12 hours. While I bought the 4S because of Siri. I wouldn't spend the money for it a second time around....it only understands you about 50% of the time. But it is a cool feature for finding things (restaurants/ coffee shops) around town. The phone on the 3g network is slow! If your not in a hurry it is not a problem. Otherwise I love this phone!
I have been an Android user for more than 4 years, and after getting the iPhone 4s. I feel like I have been wasting my time using an android phone. I know you will get more free apps on the android than the iPhone but, trust me the iPhone is worth the money. texting, facebooking, emailing, twitting or anything else in relation to the keyboard is pleasant and smooth. I will admit that without wifi my HTC EVO is way fast that the iPhone but I really love the feel and touch of the 4S. The picture quality is wonderful unbelievable. The battery life is amazing. Buy the phone if you can will not regret it.
Loving every minute of this phone and all of it's features.
The iPhone 4S is completely easy to use. I am really happy with all of the apps available on the phone when I purchased it.
As above--really nice, sleek device. I had a Palm Pre that was ahead of the I-phone 3. But the I-phone came forward while the Palm expired. The I-phone 4s does more than I need it to do, fits in my pocket easily, and works well--including navigation.
Had trouble with charger. Had to replace it twice but the phone is great
I switched from an EVO to the iPhone on Sprint because I wanted the convenience of iTunes for my music and the better camera. I found the android OS easier to use then the Apple OS but but not enough to matter ( I hate having to sign in to the app store everytime I download something). The one thing I miss is the larger display that the EVO had. Overall the 4s is pretty good phone and I really like having all my playlist and music available on my phone in the same format as my PC and ipod which I can now retire.
switched from my android to the I-phone....at this time still not convinced its better than but had less than a month. Major thing is the battery life is much longer than the android phone.
This is my first iphone and smartphone. Overall I am happy except for a few glitches that my phone is having. A couple of times it did not end the call and tried to for 10 hours. Also, my imessages do not work anymore. I had to switch to texts just so i could text my boyfriend. I am not a tech savvy person but it is fairly easy to navigate through all of the apps and settings. I love having SIRI! That is helpful except when it gives me the wrong number for a business. The battery life isn't that bad. I charge it on my way to work and on my way home.
My evo 4g was faster! I like to customize my phone my way! Taking back today and will wait for new lte line of phones to be made available from sprint. I am Andriod user! Dont get me wrong I phone is great i just like to have more options!
Moving up from a Samsung that served its purpose well. I love all my new functionality and my situation where I am moving around like a gypsy temporarily has made this purchase seem a no brainer. The only complaint is that I have so much to learn that I can do with this phone. I kill batteries fast so I bought the Mophie and love it too, I highly suggest it also. With the Mophie the phone is a little heavy but I can go 3 days on one charge and my daughters needs charged everyday without the extra battery capacity.
It is a decent phone. Definitely more reliable than any droid I have owned. Not as many options and not as user friendly as the 3D but a better overall product. I actually have two of them now, one for work and one for personal. I would suggest it if you are not too concerned with customization.
I had this phone for over a month and so far it has been better than my previous androids. The Data speed is "Average" unless you compare it with another Iphone on the ATT network, but nowdays there is free wifi everywhere and the phone connects automatically once you configure it. I had gone running (on an open area) listening to the Iheart radio app on the 3g network and the connection is 98% constant, very few buffering issues. Not the same with videos on 3g. they just take forever( if they load). Call quality is very good and the interface is excellent. Even the free GPS navigation apps works thru your car's bluetooth system. The battery does not last one day if you use it a lot so you need to carry around an extra cable to plug it in on a computer or a charger. I had many phones on the Sprint network since 1997 and this is the best phone I have ever had.
This phone is more than just a phone. It does soooo much more and I'm learning something new about it everyday. I have had my Iphone 4s for a month today. It's so easy to use, it is not complicated at all. It takes amazing pictures. If you are looking for a phone, camera, computer and so much more than I highly suggest you look into this one. :-)
This phone allows you to do so much! You really don't know the capabilities until you own one and search all of the apps available!
This is my first iphone. I do own one of the first ipod touch that they came out with so I really didn't have any problem navigating around the phone. The internet connections fast, all my apps work great, and there are more features on this phone than the previous cell phone I had. I would recommend this phone to any 1.
The phone itself is a bit blocky to me. It is pretty, easily handled, and simple to use. One must really appreciate apple to use it though. I am an android person and passed the phone on to my husband who loves apple. The sound and use is good on this device. the wifi picks up easily. I did experience a lot of dropped and lost calls with using this phone. It also would not always connect calls, and delivered messages at a delayed time lapse.
I like having the most power I can get in the smallest package I can. The iPhone seemed like the way to go - However the phone is so fragile that you have to get a case for it that makes it larger than other phones that could have survived without a case. Plus I hate iTunes. Apple has nice features but something that you carry everywhere with you should be a little more sturdy IMO. Back to Samsung and Droid i go.
This is one of the best phones I have purchased in to years. Applications can be synced with the IPAD and that works for me.
I'm enjoying the phone and all the many features and apps. However, even with the IOS 5.1 update, I'm still one of the many that is having an issue with the battery life drainage. Otherwise, it would be a 5-star rating.
I love everything about my new I phone4gs except the life of the battery is does not last long enough to enjoy all the features
Everything about this phone is kind of amazing. The only gripes I had about this phone is that it still runs on 3G speed (I own an HTC EVO 3D which is a 4g phone) and the iPhone simply cannot compete with the networking capabilities of 4g. The only way to have a juiced up iphone experience is if youre running on a fast wifi network at home or work. So with that being said, hopefully the next gen iPhone will be 4g capable. Second gripe about the phone, is that it does not allow your phone to become a voice guided gps navigatior while driving around town. I travel daily and it's not as convenient as some of the android phones that utilize google navigation to help guide you around the congested freeways of southern california. Third, is Siri. It's a cool feature, but does not always work the way you want her to. Sometimes it's faster just to do the tasks yourself, like typing out a text msg or doing an online search. Siri is helpful though when your hands are full and when there isn't a lot of background noise. All in all it's still a pretty awesome phone to own when you do the overall comparisons to what is out there!
Really no more need be said. It runs so smooth its been 3 months since Ive purchased and Im still annoying friends telling them how much I still love my phone. The improved optics on the camera were the main selling point for me. This phone with its camera and applications can truly turn anyone into an amateur photographer. Siri is a great assistant and shes wonderful at scheduling appointments and reminders and dictating text. Im at worl right now so cant continue but this phone is worth absolutely every penny. If youre buying with Best Buy PLEASE be sure to get the protection plan. 15 dollars a month sounds pricey...but it covers EVERYTHING (except loss or theft). And you can replace your phone anytime you need with no deductible.
It didn't turn into a jet and fly me anywhere, it doesn't print money, but it does have the more GBs and the Wi-Fis, so it has to be awesome. Seriously, if you need a review for an iPhone, you shouldn't be buying a phone. Go buy two cans and a string and save the world the hassle.
I have been a loyal droid user for the past few years, and I swore I would never cross to the darkside. However I have had the phone for a month and I have purchased a Mac Book, Apple TV and about $500 worth of sounds and Apps. I love it! It is well worth the investment. And Best Buy is the best place for your transaction. The service is paramount and they are knowledgeable and about everything. It is also nice to go to a place that is deverse. They sell for all the carriers so that they are able to set up a carrier that is best for you.
This is my first iPhone and I am underwhelmed. I came from Blackberry and thought this was going to be a significantly better experience. It is not. Web browsing is considerably better on the iPhone but the keyboard and durabiltiy of the BB make up for that. Also with a BB you can have a spare battery to keep you going when you travel. Siri is TERRIBLE. it only works about 50% of the time.
game apps can become addictive and Siri can be a little tempermental.
The phone is all i hoped it would be and the service although it took long to get the a representative was good also
I just luv it no problems as of date happy with my purchase
Finally joined the iPhone world with the new 4s. Great phone, great display and camera. The only hiccup I've found is that Siri is either still in Beta or the system is just getting overloaded with users. There are times when I get the "I'm sorry, I can't assist you at this time" message. Irritating on one of the premier features on the new iPhone.
I love this phone has soooo many features, i love the camera and also the video..
I cannot find anything wrong about this phone aside from the high phone bills. It is a pricey phone to own over other phones
I was debating between the iPhone and 2 Driods. My deciding factor was that I have an apple laptop as well and the two link up wirelessly when they are within range. I see a lot of negative reviews about the life of the battery. When I first got my phone, and didn't know how to use any of the features, the battery lasted about 5 days. But now that I use it a lot more, it needs to be charged every 2 days. There was only one day that the battery ran down and I was home sick using it all day long. So I would say battery life is good. Everything else is amazing on the phone. I have also found issues with buying accessories, esp the car charger. I was told my iPod charger would work but it does not. Online you can see reviewed of how chargers have fried people's phones and stuff. Makes it scary. So far, I have not located a charger for my car which is compatible.
My biggest concern is the life of the battery. If I have everything working than the battery goes down in about six hours. I disable wifi and Push than it will last all day. I dont use it very often but if I need to, than I worry that it will shut down in the middle of a conversation
i my opinion i phone is behind in tech new samsung gl II is smarter than ipnone so i return iphone that is my opinion
I bought this for my husband because he had an Android phone and was intimidated by it. He could never figure out how to do anything but make calls because every time he tried, there were so many options that he just got frustrated and gave up. This phone is so intuitive that I hardly had to help him at all! I watched in amazement as he figured out on his own how to make calls, go through his contact list, send a text and take pictures, all within minutes of setting it up. Now he even plays Words With Friends, checks the weather, and uses the calendar, which I've synced with my phone.
When I bought the iPhone 4s I was immediately blown back by it's deign and features. It has great specs and a brilliant screen. Coming from an android phone, I was use to the optional customizing offered on it's system but I had to bite that bullet. The 4s is a great device with a great battery, cool iOS, an amazing array of accessories, and comes with dynamic support from it's retailers.
i couldnt wait to get my hands on the new iphone since i never had one before but , when i got it i wanted to return it the phone suck seri sucks. You have to pay for everything it has like a million aps but u have to pay for them all so whats the point.. Cant wait till my wife upgrade is up so i can get the samsung Galaxy s2 and give her this paper weight...
When I bought this, it was to see if it could help my wife and I more organized, we had just bought her an iPad 2. We both have rotating shifts and Dr's appointments and kids. We always had trouble keeping up with things. I bought it and linked it with her iPad and they work like magic!! I've read that a lot of don't like the battery life, I've found it to be better than my android that I had. I had a Samsung Epic 4g and this blows it away, way more apps and it processes faster (imo) Siri doesn't always work the best, if your reception is shotty, but she is entertaining. It amazes me how well it understands what I'm saying. The $750 is a bit steep but if your looking to consolidate a lot of information, switch to Mac.
I switched from the android platform and have NOT looked back one bit. You will be completely satisfied with this phone ...
I waited a long time for iPhone to be available for Sprint. It's easy to use, the screen is easy to read, has good phone quality and coordinates with my me/iCloud account. It's much easier to text/message than my old smartphone. I don't use Suri much, but it seems to work well. I can't think of a single thing about this phone that I don't like.
I've been an android user for the last 4 years. Finally, I have crossed over to the darkside. I don't care about not being able to personalize my phone down to the kernel it is using. The iPhone is perfect the way it is..not to mention an excellent camera for someone who is trying to make photography their profession. I am forever an iPhone user now.
I had a Black berry, then HTC eve, but this iPhone 4s blow's them both out of the water.
This is my first smartphone and I really like it, it is everything I thought it would be
I love that you offer up to date products and the wireless service that accommodates them.
I never had a iPhone before and was worried about the ability to color code all my businesses in the calendar. But I found out you can have numerous calendars that all coordinate together. Texting is a snap, and getting to email, facebook etc., has been easy too. I still have more to learn about the phone and love it. I just found the voice memo feature to be really helpful when I don't have time to write things down.
Best phone I have ever had , it would be nice if it was 4G
I AM STILL LEARNING ALL THE STUFF YOU CAN DO WITH THIS PHONE. OVER ALL I DO LIKE IT. AS FAR AS USER FRIENDLY I WOULD GIVE IT A 80% CAN'T ADJUST ALOT OF SETTINGS AND SIRI ONLY WORKS WHEN SHE WANTS TO. IT DOESN'T LET YOU PAUSE A BIT IN BETWEEN WORDS. NEVER UNDERSTANDS ME. AND I SPEAK CLEARLY. I DO LOVE THE MUSIC I CAN PLAY.
replaced 2 very high rated Android phones with 4Ss. - should have done it sooner - best phones we have owned. Better battery life, memory management, no stupid apps using up memory and iCloud is awesome.
This phone is awesome. I am a prior Blackberry user. This is my first iphone and i am thoroughly impressed with its ability to display content and sink through the cloud. The Siri application is great and intuitive but sometimes unavailable for search questions. This may have something to do with the network that I am using. (Sprint) It is not as business savvy as my past phones but overall very functional. Facetime is great as I bought my daughter one on the same day that I purchased mine. She loves it! Now.... Apple has to do something about the battery life. It is horrendous! I am not a heavy phone user and I find that even with light to moderate use, the battery will die within 6 hours or so for me. I have tried to follow suggestions online to extend the life but to no avail. This is the major fault for this phone. If you have a charger in your car, office, and on your night stand you will be fine. You will probably not be happy with as many times as you will have to plug the phone in though. Overall I will still say that this is one of the best phones that I have owned, but i am not happy with the battery.
I wasn't due for an upgrade and paid full price for the phone, and I don't regret it at all, I love this phone. I have it for sprint
Came from an HTC Evo 4G. Wanted to see what all the fuss was about. *Calls quality & internet speeds aren't any better than HTC Evo *Phone looks very attractive & build quality is alot better than HTC Evo, but I hate the idea of having glass on both side of the phone. *Picture & video quality is significantly better than HTC Evo *Siri works great but I have real friends and don't see myself using it *Battery life is horrible *Lots of app and games but lacks productive apps *Hate the idea that it needs to be plugged into the computer and itunes for almost anything upgrades/transfer/etc *Virtual keyboard is alot more accurate and responsive than the HTC Evo *Missing lots of features that should be standard on all smartphone *Very limited on both hard and software Bottomline - Phone is very basic and is great for new or novice end users but its not for me. I'm a poweruser and needs the advance/fine tuning option. Switched to a Samsung Galaxy S II Touch and loving it.
Today I will be reviewing the IPhone 4s for Sprint but also came out for Verizon and AT&T. This is the newest and best iPhone to date. The real question here is it worth spending hundreds of dollars to upgrade and get it. The new IPhone come to a dual core processor, which larger than its predecessor. It runs iOS 5, which comes with Siri apple's new voice recognition software. It is a 3g phone and not 4g like most new phones on the market. It also comes with an 8-megapixel camera. It comes with 16, 32, or 64 megabytes of memory The new dual core processor works great with the iOS 5. When using apps there is almost no load time. It moves from screen to screen flawlessly with no delay. It is so smooth. Even though it uses 3g instead 4g like all of its competitors, apple came out with new antenna that manages to provide 4g like speeds. This combined with the dual core processor makes the phones increditably fast. I owned an HTC Evo 4g before I got the IPhone and when I compared the internet speeds they were almost the same, the Evo was a little bit faster. The iOS 5 comes with Siri which apple has put a lot of money into. Sire is by far the best voice recognition software I have ever used. The best part about is there is no phrase you have to use. You can just ask it a question like you would ask a person, it will understand you so you do not have to change how you talk to it compared when you talk to a regular person. The new 8-megapixel camera is great. It also have optical zoom instead of digital zoom, which is what most phones have. Besides taking beautiful pictures the software that it comes with it makes it easy to crop your photos and removing red eye. Battery life, which has always been a problem with the IPhones has been fixed. When pushed extremely hard the battery with last about a full days use. With regular use it can last more than two days with a full charge. Of coarse when you buy an IPhone you get the app store, which is awesome. You also get a built iPod that is really nice and that way you only need to carry one device. The new IPhone is great but does have a few problems. It does have 4g capabilities, which is not as good as its competitors. It is also expensive, it cost two hundred dollars when you sign up for two year contract and goes up another 100 dollars when you add more memory. When compared to the regular Iphone 4 there is not enough changes really for somebody to upgrade. However when compared to the other IPhones, the 3g and 3gs, you should defiantly make the upgrade. When compared to other top of the line phones on the market the IPhone stacks up pretty good, it does not have a real keyboard which is important to some people, it also does not have as large screen as other at three and half inches. All in all if you contract is up and your looking for a new phone I would go with the IPhone 4s.
This review is for those who, like me, had not made the move to "smartphones" yet, living quite contently with basic call & text functionality. My old phone was starting to fall apart, and I was at a fork in the road. What got me to cross over, and "drink the Kool Aid", was actually related to the audio side -- as an Airplay controller. I have a Denon AVR with Airplay, and 2 Apple TVs in other rooms -- but nothing was tying them together. With this phone and the Remote app, I have iTunes controlled for the entire house, including the patio, with a device which is usually in my pocket anyway! I was not prepared for how cool all of the other features would be -- and wonder how/why I waited so long to check these out! This is truly an amazing device -- an excellent camera, very slick texting (not going to miss waiting a few seconds to click a number key 3 times to get one letter!!), the built-in ipod, and the apps...incredible! Even itunes sounds better than with my ipod Classic, must be a better DAC? I haven't done much yet with Siri -- too many other features to get comfortable with first, but it may have some merit down the line. Only negative seems to be that the battery needs to be charged way too fast -- might be because I have too much turned on, but seems to be a common theme in reviews. BTW, I got an OtterBox after seeing a friend's phone after a drop! Great product -- and though I'd resisted going "all in" with Apple over the years, I must admit that they make really good stuff. I'm a believer now!
I recieved my iPhone 4S last friday and I wanted to wait a couple of days before I created a review on it. This phone is at the top of the line of great smartphones. The camera takes stellar photos, Internet is fast, and the battery life lasts throughout the day. Compared to my HTC Evo 4G that I've had for about a year before I received this phone, the battery life comparisons are ridiculous. The iPhone blows the HTC Evo out of the water. Incredible phone.
THIS IS A TOP NOTCH PHONE IPHONE 4S & SPRINT ROCK YOU CANT CANT BETTER THAN THIS EVERYTHING YOU WANT OR NEED IN A PHONE IS HERE ITS JUST SIMPLE A MUST HAVE NUFF SAID!!
This phone is a step up from my blackberry. It is very easy to use and having the ability to use the cloud for storage is great. The only problem is battery life. With the ability to do so much it drains the battery.
This is a great phone. My Droid Incredible on Verizon could not get a signal in my house. This Sprint phone gets full bars in house. Also the 3G is pretty fast but not blazing. The long wait for a pre-order was horrible, but the phone was worth the wait. Really like Siri!
Those that were hoping for a completely different phone from Apple this year, are probably going to be disappointed with the iPhone 4S - especially those who already have an iPhone 4. For the rest of us, we get one of the best phones on the market. I have been an Android user for the last two years, and I am loving the 4S. The operating system is very slick and streamline, and is crystal clear on the gorgeous screen. The upgraded chip allows you to watch videos in full HD - even Netflix now streams select programming in HD over Wi-Fi. Playing games is also enhanced, with the graphics being taken to the next level, as well as flawless gameplay. I played Real Racing 2 and Fifa '12, both of which were an absolute pleasure. Of course, the 8MP camera looks amazing, with a very fast start up time - taking pictures is very snappy, which makes it easier to capture that moment. Video is smooth and clear, with no pixelation, and colors snap on the screen. I just wish there was an HDMI port to plug straight into a TV. The introduction of iCloud is what really won me over. It allows you to back up pictures, movies and documents (up to 5GB for free). Also, if you use iTunes for music (even TV shows), iCloud can download your purchases to the device when connected to Wi-Fi or data. Plus, the upcoming iTunes Match will allow you to potentially play all of your music on your phone, not just what you have previously purchased on iTunes. Those wanting to know about Siri should be pleased to know that it works as advertised. The personal voice assistant is great for using in the car, for sending/reading text messages, setting appointments or reminders, and even playing a certain song from your music library without having to navigate the menus. Other than that, it's been helpful gathering information for my kids' homework! Overall, I am very pleased with my iPhone 4S. There are too many features to cover here, so I mostly touched upon the improvements from the iPhone 4. Those wanting to upgrade from the 4 might want to reconsider, unless you really want a better HD video experience and superior gameplay. Those getting their first iPhone or are upgrading from the 3 or 3GS, should definitely go for it. The only thing I would like to see is a faster data connection, as 3G has been a bit of a step back from HSPA+ on T-Mobile.
I am glad i purchased the Iphone. The GPS function helped me to arrive safely from my trip to Orlando Florida, and back home. Siri is very helpful too, great addition. My children like her assistance. If I had anything negative to say about the Iphone, it would be that whenever i taking photos, i can't make the object closer if i am a far distance. Also, while video taping, i can get the photo closer. But overall, i am pleased with my purchase.
I bought my iPhone in May this year and It's now August and I'm still loving it. I'm not near as frustrated with it as I was my Evo. Great product.
Much fewer quirks than all my previous Droids. Don't like that I can't customize it as much though. Sound quality is not as good but that may just be my Lifeproof case. Love it over all!!
I was hesitant to replace my Galaxy Nexus S 4G with an iPhone 4s, but at my daughter's insistence, I jumped in. Best phone I've ever owned. Great size, incredible battery life and don't get me started on the apps! Practical and entertaining all in one high quality package. Gotta give props to Apple, they know quality!
Great phone. Never considered anything but an android. I love android phones but they have gotten way to big for my taste. I phone gave me the size i like, the memory and also the ease of navigation. I am very pleased with my purchase
Nice phone, some times slow in txt but that's a service issue.
I am very happy so far with my IPhone. Going from a Blackberry to the IPhone is a world of difference. The quality, capability and apps are impresive for my uses. I am not a supporter of Apple by any means but they did a good job with this. Like I said the price is a little hefty but is comparable to other smart phones.
I resisted getting an iPhone after suffering with an AndroidOS phone (Samsung Epic 4G), I broke down and picked this up. I've found it to be a great overall smart phone. It's definitely more robust than the Epic I had prior to this. No system crashes, no reboots required, better and more apps. As a photographer, I'm astounded by the quality of the onboard camera. The iPhone is an all around win. The phone's sound quality is even better. I thought I'd miss having a physical keyboard but have managed to adapt pretty quickly. On the downside, while the battery life is MUCH better than the Epic's, it could be better (probably true of all smartphones, though). I'm also amazed that there isn't a turn by turn navigation app built in. Although I did find a great free app in the App Store, it's not integrated into the contacts, calendar, etc as a native app could be.
Good phone but battery runs out way to fast when my husband has the same phone and an iPhone 4 and both last a lot longer.
overall I'm pleased with the phone. has plenty of options that come in handy
I had the 3GS then switched to a android phone with the larger screen but when my upgrade came up I switched back because of the reliability of the iPhone and the large number of neat stuff like docks and radar detectors and such for it.
I switched over from a Droid and absoultely do not regret my decision. The IPhone is so much easier to use and get familiar with. The battery life goes fairly quick, however the recharge time is unbelievably fast.
I had a Sprint HTC Slider 4G. I rarely got 4G. The battery life was short, couldn't get rid of the 'crapware,' and it always had to be booted. The Iphone 4s is running great, no crapware, no software snafus. I might even ditch my Windows PC and go the Mac way.
I waited until the iPhone 5 came out to get the 4S at a lower price. I had an HTC Hero and found it limited my ability to load applications with it's limited on board memory. The iPhone is a great device and has all of the features I'm looking for in a smart phone. Features make it easy to create an event or add a contact.
I had a blackberry for 3yrs and was just not happy with the slow internet speed and using the phone keypad was hard to see.The apps that were around for this phone really were nothing much. I waited for the i phone 5 to come out and saved $100 the next day.This phone the 4s is just great .Easy to use and tons of apps I think my wife might get one of these when she gets her nails shorter to use the touch screen
I get mad at it when it drops calls and I just want to smash it.
I chose the iPhone 4S over the iPhone 5 and I love the decision I made. I upgraded from a Samsung Replenish so anything was better than that phone. This phone has a great retina display, takes great pictures and videos, and uploads apps really fast. I need to use my phone all day at work (10 hrs), so my battery runs low each time I use it. Great phone overall
Bought this product for my wife and it's already falling appart.
The good news about this case is the rubber isn't tearing like the previous model did.
Very good cover. Protects as advertised. Would recommend to anyone looking for a great cover.
I love my Defender series Otter Box. The only thing wrong is that I was putting the rubber piece on over the plastic and it ripped in one little spot. Its not a big deal, I still use it.
Good product, only downside is the flap by the charger plug doesn't stay closed when not in use.
The latest version is much sturdier than the previous. The outer material is less flexible than the prior one. Holds up much better! The case remains intact.
This case is very strong and will definitely protect your phone from most accidents. The only problem I have is while texting. Because the case is thick, it is hard to access some parts of the touch screen but I think the inconvenience is worth the protection you get.
I'm a dropper, so I bought the otterbox at the same time I bought the phone. It gives really good protection, but I really have to coax the little flaps back into place after I use my earbuds or plug the phone in. Also, when I listen to audio on my phone while I I walk, I put the phone in the belt clip attachment with the screen facing out so I can easily access the stopwatch. Most of the time I have the screen facing in. When I switch from screen facing in to screen facing out, I have to turn the actual clip on the belt clip holder. I don't know if its clear what I mean by that, but at any rate, it's a teeny annoyance.
I ordered the pink/plum. I ended up returning it. The color was hideous . I got the one with the flag. Its been great. No problems.
The cover itself is nice but the rubber texture "sticks" to everything. If you put it in your pocket, it doesn't go in easy or come out that way either. The cover usually comes off the phone when you pull it out of your pocket; May be a great cover for carrying on a belt clip.
Dropped the phone with this cover off the table and it came away without any issues. Bought two others for family members with the same phone.
This case is pretty good. It feels like it would take an impact pretty well. But, after a week or so, the case became really loose and my phone even fell out of the case after about a month resulting in a couple of nice scratches on my phone. It even almost falls out when I take it out of my pocket (which is hard to do anyways with this material) and my purse. This would be an okay "I'm just waiting to find the right case" case. However, it is not a very good case for any medium to long amount of time.
This case is okay for about a month but then it starts to stretch. Pretty soon it will probably not fit the phone anymore. I like the gel material but it needs to be made to hold its' shape.
Fits perfect around iPhone 4 and gives me a good gripe
Superb technology! Love the iPhone 4. I bought it to replace an old LG phone and am confident it was one of the best purchase decisions I have made in quite a while.
Love the phone, very useful and the kids love it :)
Service on buying two of these iPhones was superb! Kirsten took the time to apply the shields to our devices and also transferred contacts from our old phones.
This was one of the best buys of the year. We intended to get the iPhone 4S, but the 2 for 1 sale for the iPhone 4 32GB was too good to pass up! Our carrier is Verizon, we never have dropped calls unless we do it ourselves, and both phones have worked perfectly for us!
Does almost anything except wash dishes. Holds a ton of music. Messages, e-mails, apps, etc. And you can use it as a phone, too.
I've been a die-hard PC user with not much interest in Apple/MAC products until now! The iPhone4 is so easy to use, intuitive, fast, clear and built well. I will not change back to Blackberry.
Best Buy had a buy one, get one free iPhone 4 on Christmas Eve. My husband and I bought them. We absolutely love them! Don't know why I waited so long!
I resisted all attempts to get me into the 21st Century with texting and the like. Got my iPhone 4 as a gift and am thoroughly impressed with its ease of use. Far beyond anything I imagined it would be.
Great for searching while on the go and eliminating the GPS Unit. If you want to watch movies, a charger has to be in place so you will know how it ends. Now I'm able to load up as much music as possible without fear of having to delete previous stuff.
If you're familiar with the iPod then you know what to expect from that. Its great for texting and making calls. The app store is always adding content so that new phone feeling never really goes away. Make sure you get a case for it. I got the thinnest / cheapest one I could find and its worked great for me.
I have been an Android user for three years now. I've had three Android phones, and all three have had the same couple of major problems. The phone doesn't work half the time (phone locks up for almost a minute when you need to dial or answer the phone), and the phone locks up for a long time whenever you want to access a large picture library. I also know several others that have the exact same problems with their Android phones. Every single person I talked to that owned both platforms preferred the iPhone. Also, every review on the 'net showed the iPhone besting Android. I finally broke down and decided to try it. I am very impressed. The interface takes a little getting used to, but it always works. The phone always works. The camera roll always cranks right up. The icons easily move, go into folders, and update. Notifications are unobtrusive, apps always work perfectly. Not one crash, not one byte of data lost. iTunes on my PC syncs everything easily. Purchase apps on the phone, they instantly show in iTunes. Purchase them in iTunes, they instantly sync with the phone. iTunes even takes a screenshot of the phone's home screen and you can configure the phone right from iTunes. Very polished, very nice. Well done Apple. Additionally, the display is crisp. The fonts are smooth. The icons look good. The pull down info (iOS 5) is really nice. I wish it was a little bigger. My Droid X was very roomy. I also wish someone would develop a scripting app (a la Tasker for Android). Strangely, there is a lack of good case and clip combos for the iPhone. The keyboard is also not great. Please Apple put a keyboard with multi-character keys. Gingerbread on my Droid X has the best keyboard of any phone! iPhone needs that keyboard! One last complaint: there is no app I've seen to quickly toggle the wi-fi radio. That's about it! It's just a great handset! I'm a convert.
I think the phone is too heavy and I don't like to talk on it. Best Buy was a good place to make my purchase but I wish I had not spent what I did on it. I am putting it away and have order a Samsung Alias 2. More suitable for my needs. Thank you.
The iPhone 4 is a great phone for anyone to have. It can be for anyone who simply just likes games, or maybe for someone who is a heavy texter. Either way i would recommend this phone to anyone. Even if you are not so handy with phones i think for a first time user it is very easy because at the touch of your finger it brings you to where you want to go. Which is good because i know from experience my parents and grandparents have trouble using a phone.
Works like it was made to interface with my Mac. Contacts, notes, apps, calendars and tunes. Seems to keep charge OK on Verison network.
I bought mine Feb 2011.. It's been the best phone I've ever had! Won't buy any others from now on. Only APPLE!!! It does everything... I did purchase the Otter box case for mine. It works great... Dropped on tile floor several times.... Ph works fine. So easy to use. Battery stays charged up forever unless your playing music. Speakers sound really good too...
This is a great smart phone. All the apps make it great on the go. The only annoyance I've had is that the processor is running a little slower now that i have 20 GB of data on my phone.
OK I loved my Palm Pre. I was a firm Palm girl. unfortunately with time the Pre Plus did not exceed expectations. The app store and the quality of apps disappointed me. I had an iPod 30g so the iPhone was at the top of the list and won me over. I have never been so pleased. My #1 thing with a smart phone is ebooks. I had always used Mobipocket reader worried I would not be able to read them. Well the Kindle app was harder to figure out than I wanted. so I started looking for alternatives. iBooks works extremely well actually is easier to organize the books than Mobipocket. with Stanza I can read unprotected mobipocket .PRC and other forms. the Apps are amazing and endless. the iPhone battery last forever. I was always charging my Pre. and when I would play music forget not having it charging at the same time. The iPhone does use power with games and music and videos I tell you nothing like my old phone. The display is so color rich. I love how true the colors are. I love Face time. I have use skype but facetime is so much easier. now iTunes has a "cloud" I can access all my old tv and movies that were lost when a portable hard drive crashed. Bonus!! I had looked at iPhone when it first came out and hated the keyboard. I like the new style it appears easier to use than what I remember of the old style. I sometimes like and other times hate the spelling help. but as a poor speller it usually wins smiles from me. I have only found a negative in the screen size. It is longer than the palm pre but not wider. My father has a Motorola Droid X. the screen is huge. I think I would like a bigger screen for web surfing and texting and video. but I love the size of the overall phone for portablity. I can still stuff it in my pocket. I am also able to clip a thin hard case to the phone to protect it and get it in to my leather pouch for my waist band so I can carry it at work.
I'm slow to the smart phone party but my phone up and died and what the heck... I was a little worried about how well it would work in my marginal coverage area but have had zero dropped calls - better than my previous phone for sure. Set up and use has been easy - one of my fears was adding yet another computer to maintain but so far, there is nothing to do but use it. One of my favorite things about the iphone is how it syncs up my calendar and address book every time it is docked. have not gone APP happy but have found a number of useful free ones on the i-tunes store. It works well with my local network and switches between that and the cell network without a fuss. Wish the battery lasted longer. The person that set it up at Best Buy did a great job and showed me enough to leave the store with a working tool.
If you don't have an iPhone, you don't have an iPhone!
At first, I couldn't wait to get my iphone! But once I did I can't put into words how totally and utterly disgusted I was with it! It is slow as can be and it constantly crashed, never could hardly get a signal, dropped calls regularly, etc. Believe me, the list goes on until I simply couldn't take anymore and trashed it. My girlfriend has an android and also has SO many problems with hers so I bought a Windows 7 phone and I've never been happier!! I LOVE WINDOWS PHONE 7!!!
I just watched a new that the iphone gathers your personal information without any consent, sends it to Apple. CRAZY PHONE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I purchased the iPhone3Gs 09/09 and have now switched to much better service (not naming names) and got the iPhone4 and have been in heaven ever since. This phone is just amazing with all it can do and still hold a great battery life. The one thing I wish for are more free apps and FLASH!! Shame apple and adobe don't get along. Oh well. I tried android in between and found that I missed the way the iphone worked and the ease of the use if the applications and the battery life. I promise I will never change again! Best purchase, worth the $$$. Verizon aint that bad either :)
Recently, I needed to buy a new phone, so I took a chance on the new iphone 4. People kept telling me that the new iphone had a bundle of problems that came along with it. I took a chance anyways, and so far I have found that the phone it easy to operate, easy to look at, and the best phone I have ever owned. From the beginning I have had no trouble operating the phone in anyway. Every app and function of the phone is easy to find, simple to operate, and extremely convenient. I have seen other android phones and I found them hard to get used to, this is the opposite with the iphone 4, any person could pick the phone up a be comfortable with it in about 10 minutes. There are some dropped calls, but I think it the carriers fault for the most part. Some people say that certain apps one the phone crash, but I have not experienced that at all. It is a bit spendy, but overall if you have the extra cash it is a good purchase. I have no regrets in buying this phone.
Well, it's a decent phone now that it's on the VZW network. But it's really no different than it was when it ws introduced years ago. Heck, they finally added the ability to change your wall paper, for goodness sake. Drawbacks: The interface is clunky if you want to switch between apps and have several apps running at once. If you are playing a game and get a text message, i will probably throw you out of the game. Only the native iPhone apps work well together (like itunes pausing when you get a call. Other music apps can't do that. Silly design so that the signal strength drops if you hold it in your left hand. And if you drop it, plan on it shattering. Some do, but Apple thinks they know better and only offer one model. Battery life is still poor, but acceptable. You will wish you could just swap in a fresh battery, but it's sealed up so you can't. iPhone users just carry their charging cord with them everywhere. And this thing is supposed to be leading the post-PC era, but you have to plug it in to a PC to make it work. What's up with that? And no flash, ever, because Jobs doesn't like it. Upsides: Lot's of apps, some of them are really good. You can share those apps with your iPad if you have both. Lot's of 3rd party accessories. Most hotels have an iPhone plug in on the clock radio, even. Facetime is cool, but only if all your friends have iPhones. Apple requires 30% of in-app purchase fees be paid to them, so lot's of developers are paying waaaay too much to Apple and that money comes from you. So apps and accessories are the best of any phone. Battery life is below average. Clunky interface compared to competition. Apple works hard to prevent customizing. Palm and Google encourage it. That's important to me.
Finally a phone that works!! No more dropped calls! No more screen freezes! No more false email notifications! Finally my sent emails get to there destination! I am loving this phone!
I bought this phone about 2 days ago and so far I'm not that impressed!I'm coming from the epic on sprint and apple may have more apps but android has better apps.the iPhone 4 is a great phone but it is limited by the iOS that it uses.no notification bar makes knowing what u missed a hassle.the battery is subpar so don't buy thinking your going to be on the phone all day.the phone itself is so fragile so u need a case and a screen protector so get the protection plan also.I mean it's glass!but overall great phone it's just limited by it's os.android knows what it's doing apple needs to catch up!I would recommend this phone to somebody who hasn't had an android if u had an android don't switch. Might be takin back and getting thunderbolt!
I switched from Sprint and an Evo to get the iPhone 4 on the Verizon network and I do not regret the switch. I'm already heavily invested in the Apple eco system with an iPad, iMac, and over 1TB of video content purchased from iTunes so it is VERY nice to finally have a mobile device that fits in my pocket that can play back that purchased content. Syncing with my iMac was simple and a breeze and an added bonus was that most of the apps I had purchased for my iPad were "universal" apps that worked with the iPhone as well. The iPhone 4 is one beautiful piece of engineering and it's nice to look at. For me that is an important point. I'll be looking at this thing every day for the foreseeable future and pleasant aesthetics is crucial. Who wants to look at and handle an ugly device day in and day out? Pros: Insane battery life, especially for someone coming from an Android device. The Retina Display cannot be described adequately in words, it literally has to be seen to be believed. Tens of thousands of apps. Very nice pictures via the camera and HD video that puts my Sony H-20 to shame. Cons: The notification system in iOS 4 could use some serious help. Very serious help. Lack of widgets for quick access to apps and information on the home screen. Overall this is an excellent phone!
I bought iPhone 32GB last week. Its finally here in Verizon. I was Droid use for 3years with Droid, The last Droid phone i use was Motorola Droid X.. Now I love Apple iPhone. Here why i change to Apple iPhone: (1) Better Apps and thousands more droid market (2) Retina Display is awesome compare to other phone can't compare (3) Easy to use and simple but competitive with other phones.(4) Quality of these Apple iPhone is high quality material, not like 80-90 percent plastic and lightweight phones. (4) I am available to enjoy my music with one device now with itunes.iPhone has good battery life too. Apple made believer out of me, No more Droid phone fore me.
best thing ever-theres nothing my apple iphone won't do, it's got a vortex of memory where I can store all my files, be it music, videos, pdf, word, excel, you name it and its got it. the best part is when i am on the move I hardly feel the need to open my laptop. i can send sms's, emails, use it to fax files, use the internet, play games, load applications faster than I have seen any phone do. I have had this phone for 4 months now, and never did face any problem. apple has hit a jackpot this time. It's the best thing ever.
This phone is revolutionary. It is advanced for its time and simply put - fantastic. It has THE BEST GRAPHICS I have ever seen on any device, ease of usability, a fantastic and revolutionary app store, and is a great business/gaming phone. It is extremely reactive (one of the many things I like about it over the Droid), has an amazing interactive keyboard (usually, smartphone keyboards are disliked as they are hard to use, but this one is love at first sight). It acts as anything you want ... a bar code scanner, a GPS, a locator, and a video game substitute. This phone is extremely recommended.
A year and a half ago, I left my wonderful iphone because I was on an unreliable network. I thought : "why have a phone when the reception is so spotty?" Verizon became my new home. For months, I have waited for the arrival of the iphone on Verizon. Finally, I am reunited with a superior phone on a reliable network. If you are a fanboy or girl, you know how wonderful Apple products are with seamless integration of apps and auto synching using Mobile me. The slim profile, touch screen, fantastic apps, and "find my iphone" capability are just some of the great features of the iphone4. Thanks to the "buy back" program Best Buy offers, a large part of my investment will be returned when I purchase the iphone5. Thanks to Best Buy, Verizon and Apple. I am a very happy customer!
this is so much better then the one had before and it could even be best phone4 in the world my world that is
it has wireless printing and games with the internet
All this talk about you can't surf and call at the same time is pointless for established Verizon users. This has always been an issue, but most stayed with Verizon for coverage, reliability, and service. It is not like we are missing out on something that we had. Besides the majority of time I needed both was when I had access to wifi anyway. Phone is solid. I prefer over the original motoola droid I had. Cleaner interface, smooth transitions, and great display. Plus the choice and quality of apps IMHO are consistently there to meet my needs.
it is the best phone that i ever hod in me life and it could be a litle then the phone i have before
I also pre-ordered my iPhone on 2/3/11 and I actually got it earlier than I had anticipated. It's beautiful and flat out the most useful phone/tool I have ever had. If you have never owned an iPod touch or iPhone this device can and will most likely change your life! I'm upgrading from a 32GB iPod touch 3rd Gen so I'm used to apps and other features that apple offers so now that I have the ability to make phone calls and do other things like speak to text I am in a state of bliss! I've been with Verizon for about 10 years now and I can count on 2 hands the number of dropped calls I've had. I look forward to many years of practical use. *One note* Data does seem a little slow at times. Particularly email. Sometime the wheel of death rears it's ugly head and just spins like it's trying to download the messages but I've had a few time out. If I hit refresh it downloads it. Granted I've been driving each time this has happened and web pages load quite smoothly. If you haven't already get this phone! You won't regret it!
i cool and itbe on the top ten phone on the internet
as someone who was an at&t iphone user i can say this phone literally blows it out of the water, especially when it comes to call quality, the most important feature of a phone. if you recently bought an android device because verizon didnt have an iphone, this is your chance to fix that. unlike the at&t phone i have had no antenna issues and i have unlimited data. thank you verizon and apple!!
Best smart phone in Market. I'm coming from a blackberry storm 2 and this phone is much faster more features and better screen. I will miss blackberry bbm and world phone featurebut I so happy I made the switch.
It is a amazing how it is this phone. 10 points Verizon. Slowly but surely.
Great phone The phone that changed everything. It continues to set the standard with its face time video calls, stunning retina display, powerfull A4 chip and long battery life.
Along with many others, I have been waiting a long time for Verizon to offer the iPhone and now that it is here I am not disappointed. I have had mine for 4 days now (pre-ordered on 2/3/11) and have not had a single dropped call. Activation and setup was very easy. With iTunes loaded on my PC, I just plugged it in and the activation was automatic. I have the Personal Hotspot and tried it out with my iPad and it connected effortlessly providing a very good connection. I have my corporate e-mail setup through Exchange, along with Comcast, Yahoo and Gmail. With "push" turned on my battery was down to about 30% after a typical day of use. When I changed it to check e-mail every 15 minutes, I had about 55% battery left at the end of the day.
An I-PHONE, enough said! I love everything about it.
Never imagined I would join the "apple army" but having my last blackberry crash and with RIM being outdated I checked out the iphone. At first I thought oh no as there was no keypad just the touchscreen. Have had both touchscreen and keypad with the torch I was unsure but made the leap and am happy I did. No comparing this to a blackberry. Love all the available apps and the ease of use. Hmm .. . ipad, macbook here I come.
I bought this phone on September 24, 2010. It was my first jump into the world of iOS. To say I had high expectations would be undercutting it by a lot. I had several friends who owned this phone and several more who suggested it for me. Well, they were right! My phone is now over a year old and I use it constantly. I'm always texting, playing a game, browsing the web (what I do most often), emailing, setting calendar dates, etc. The only thing I rarely do is make phone calls, as ironic as that is. The phone takes great pictures for what it is (a phone). It has become my primary point-and-shoot when i want to leave my DSLR at home. It is also amazingly good for web browsing. Many times, I use my phone instead of my laptop...especially if the web-related task is a quick one. Get a case for it, though. This phone doesn't respond well to being dropped. I have an OtterBox Defender on mine. The wide variety of apps available makes iOS a sure win.
I had an iPhone 3G that was getting way to SLOW with the new iOS. The 4 is awesome! I especially enjoy the new multi-tasking and iMessage services. Depending upon where you are at & what you are doing, the battery will deplete very quickly. Count on a daily charge for even average use of GPS, data and wifi. Battery life does improve if you turn off all the SMART features, but what fun is that?
Enjoy the advanced options on this iPhone as to 3Gs
It's the best phone I have had it does everything you could wand and the pictures and videos turn out great .
This phone was a replacement for a Samsung Captivate. This phone has a much better response as well as graphical display. It has an excellent camera!
i had a flip phone for years and didn't think I needed a "smart" phone. I keep my calendar synced with outlook, music synced and contacts with email. I can listen to music in the car and it stops playing music when a call comes in. I always missed calls before. when i am waiting for anything - oil change, dept of motor vehicles, kids dentist, etc I can play games or view emails on the internet. It takes better pictures than my old camera too.
my Iphone4 was a great buy. It's working very good with AT&T supprt. I would recommend the Iphone to everyone wanting a smartphone.
I read reviews on any major purchase I make at any store. That's why I decided to post. It's an iPhone. Enough said.
Waited awhile for the price drop, I had one of the first iphones from 2006 so just an iphone4 was a great upgrade and am happy with it. will use this phone for 4 or 5 years then see whats out then to upgrade again....
This is a great phone for people that don't know much about the workings of a phone.
Store was unable to transfer data from old phone (machine broke), told to come back but still could not transfer now waiting for new machine. Don't find it the most intuitive, have not been able to understand/use all features; miss some features from basic phone.
My first iPhone was 3 years old and was really showing age in speed and features. I am finding new things to do and enjoy everyday on this phone. I am glad I stuck with Apple phone. With so many choices nowadays you really do not know what is truly the best for you. I think I made the right choice.
great phone but manual should have come with phone, 274 if you want to download and print.
I always get my mobile phones from Best Buy. I purchased the iphone 4. That same day, and the next day, I had some issues with it. It kept saying no sims card installed. I returned to Best Buy the next day, and they quickly remedied the situation by changing out the sims card. They said if that did not work, return again and they would give me a new phone. But it worked okay from then on. I love the iphone4. It lives up to all the hype. I wouldn't trade it for any other phone. I am usually having to depend on my daughters to help me with all the ins and outs of my electronic devices, but I find this very easy to use, and have not really needed any help from them.
The device performs well. I use it for phone, text, calendar, and email. My negative experience is with the placement of the buttons on the side. When using the phone, I have a tendency to touch the two round buttons (+ and -). I have had this cause me to lose my telephone connection. I carry the phone in my pants pocket. After using the device for whatever reason, when I return it to my pocket, often a selection is made from one of the icons. I am hoping that I don't accidently select an option that takes some action. Lastly, I have to charge the battery almost every day. It would be nice if the battery would last longer. I use the device for business and I can't afford to have the battery go dead on me.
The phone is awesome except for the fact that the "home" button constantly gets stuck. Everytime I am on the verge of exasperation and going to bring it back to Best Buy, it starts working again. Very frustrating. I went on line and discovered this is a frequent problem with the iPhone 4.
This is my second iPhone I have had. I bought the iPhone 3GS the day it came out but eventually switched to Android hoping for a better battery life. Big mistake. The iPhone 4 has a far superior battery life and design than the 3GS and most other phones on the market. The different interactions with other electronics, programs, and services make it an essential tool and media/entertainment for anyone who tries it.
Great phone overall. Could be a bit more user friendly.
Great phone. User friendly, many purposes, been very helpful on a daily basis with business tools, news, reading, music, maps and many more. So far, battery life has been great.
The interface is by far the best out there. The apps work (not like some on Android). The resolution of the screen is like carrying around an HDTV. If you have an Apple TV the AirPlay works like a charm. The build quality and design are nothing but the best. I consistently get between 2-6 Mbps in the metro(Minneapolis/St Paul) for speeds.
I LOVED my first iphone (1st generation), but the battery sucked and it was refurbished too many times and finally conked out on me. I bought this for the video, camera, longer battery, and auto focus. I don't use the video as much as I thought I would, the camera is good, still no zoom and the flash kind of washes out photos and I usually end up turning it off. The battery is a *little* longer lasting, but I still have to carry around my charger wherever I go and plug it in when in the car. I did do some deposits from my phone now that I have the auto focus, that was nice.
iPhone 4 is just the best phone. Screen, apps, ease of use, camera (love the camera), it's just the best phone on the market and I don't think any phone will match up to it.
Overall I am very happy with my iPhone. Many of my friends have the Droid phones and all of them need to have a charger with them at all time. I use my iPhone constantly, with many apps and bluetooth devices and still only charge overnight. It's reliable, quick and so functional.
Great Product I like everything about it. I have used the hotspot feature for work while on the road and it worked flawlessly.
This is my second iphone, loved the first one---but my contract was up and I decided to trade it in for an upgraded model---I just the love it. I would never go with another phone--I really can't say anything bad about it---it does everything!!!!! I love being able to multitask on this phone---the only thing I would like to see is maybe a flashing light to let you know you have a missed call or text. But it shows you when you hit the home button anyway....the intranet sometimes lags but its not the phone its the carrier. This phone is definately faster than the iphone 3g.
At first i was skeptical about the apple brand as a phone buy it combines the convenience of a iPod/phone.It was a win win although when i do scroll down it so happens to turn black and freeze on me.I do not know why it does that but i do like it very much.
I bought this phone because I had the 3GS and loved it. I love this phone even more. The camera is amazing, it's easy to text on, and the call quality is amazing. I would recommend this phone to everyone.
Great phone. This was my first smart phone and I love it. I have never had it lock up on me and I use it a lot. Really easy to set it and love all the features it has to offer.
Good product. OK price. A lot of features. Nice disign.
Really easy to learn to use, works great , have enjoyed discovering all the apps. the phone has to offer.
Love my Iphone 4 and refuse to use any other. I tried and imo they failed.
You definitely need to get a bumper for the phone, otherwise you'll have a problem with dropped calls. I bought this phone for my husband, and every now and again, for an unknown reason, calls won't work. If I call him, it will go straight to voicemail, and he can't call out, even though there are full bars. The solution is he has to shut the phone off completely and turn it back on again. Doesn't happen too often, but is incredibly inconvenient when it does. Mainly because he doesn't find out about it right away, and ends up missing a bunch of calls. I have the 32G and haven't had this problem.
I've owned them all. Evo, Evo shift, Galaxy, Epic, Nexus S w/ Gingerbread, Dual screen Echo, BB Style, BB bold, BB Curve, BB Storm, BB Torch, all the Palm phones including the Pre, and I just tried out the new Samsung Infuse 4G w/ 4.5 in. Super amoled plus display. You just can't beat usability of the iPhone 4, period. You can't beat the IPhone build quality. Only the Blackberrys have a slightly brighter display for outdoor viewing. Only one problem, the BB display is too pixilated to read tiny fonts so the brightness becomes a waste and battery eater. The IPhone 4 display is bright and so crisp you can actually read the tiny fonts before you zoom in on the browser. The speaker volume is great, so is the ear speaker and call quality better than all I mentioned above. I hear many talk about the limited customization for the iPhone when compared with Android devices. Well when you really think about it the iPhone is really more customizable than Android. Why, more Apps. And believe me there is a app for anything you could possibly need to do on a phone and more, anything! I resisted the iPhone for a long time determined to stick with the Andriod "wiDgets". When you are on the go trying to manage many tasks at once there is no time to think of fiddling with home screen and widgets. Just hit the round center home button on your iPhone and you are on your way to 275,000 different way to customize if so inclined. The others are getting close but not there. You are going to have to bite the At$t or Veri$on bullet for now if you want the best phone.
Made the switch to the iPhone and I have to say it is amazing. Great to have your mp3 player and Phone all in one unit. E-mail accounts are easy to set up and use on the iPhone. And all the apps that are available make this a powerful phone. The screen is crisp and bright. Pictures and videos come to life on the large display. Programs and Games run fast. Simple to hook up to iTunes and get started by registering your iPhone. Many options available to tweak the phone the way you want it. Data is not unlimited anymore but there are packages available. I renew my AT&T contract and went with the $15/200MB plan which is what I was paying on my other phone, Samsung Eternity. I never have use more than 300MB a month in the past for checking e-mails and web sites etc so I think this will be fine for me. There are additional data plans that cost more and offer a higher cap. The iPhone has Wi-Fi so I use that when I am at home or at work. There are also free Wi-Fi hot spots in the area so the data package I selected is not an issue for me. I recommended getting the free Wi-Fi locator app. All and all I am very happy with this phone. Only reason I did not get an iPhone sooner was because of the $30 data package that was required to get an iPhone in the past. Not anymore.
I've had all kinds of smartphones; made from Droid, Blackberry, LG, and Samsung. Don't get me wrong, they were semi-satisfying phones but the iPhone will always fit all of my needs. It's easy to use and great to have. Personally, I don't like Apple; I'm more of a PC person but my first smartphone was the first iPhone (gen; my friend gave it to me), then upgraded to the 3G, and it was alright. After a while that's when I decided I should experience other phones just in case there was another phone that might do better. As soon as I laid my hands on the iPhone 4, that's when I knew I have found my phone. The simplicity is what probably got to me and I couldn't ask for any better! I HIGHLY recommend this phone. :)
Excellent screen and resolution. Best phone out there.
Highly usable product from the company of apple, all features of the high end phone is correctly framed and provided to the user in a convient manner.
Look and feel of the phone is very nice and, able to access all the applications and website very easily.
Hands down beats bb, driod(cePt hacks)and any other phones. Best phone I've had in the last 5 years
Enjoyed the upgrade! The customer service at Best Buy was awesome! I just wish FaceTime worked outside of wi-fi.
The IPhone 4 is a great phone. I love all of the Apps from Apple and the camera is great. The best thing about the phone is the extra long battery life. All of my other phones in the past needed to be charged daily, but I can go 2 or 3 days before having to charge the IPhone. Great phone!
Apple's attention to detail is awesome, great phone and quality.
Big improvement from previous models due to faster processing speed. AT&T cannot handle multitasking (voice and data) as advertised. Simply put, AT&T is the BIG draw-back and Verizon model does not handle full international capabilities due to CDMA technology.
The best purchase that I ever made! Wish I had begun buying Apple products a long, long time ago. Well worth the price!
Good Device if you have a good service provider with good coverage. I am happy with the device but the battery life could be made better. About Features it is good and has secured application. The Service provided by Best Buy while i purchased the iPhone is very good.
Eat this android lovers:) The bezt phone ever Forget that att is bad, great download speeds
I love the camera on the new Iphone 4!!! Its actually way better then my digital camera, and i paid good money for that camera!!! I love how its a lot faster, the picture is clear, i absolutely love the multitasking.
I am very happy with the Iphone 4. I do wish that the battery lasted longer but everything else is awesome! I was a little disappointed that AT&T required me to purchase a more expensive data plan ($45), in order to utilize the Personal Hotspot function but at least I did not have to purchase a data plan for my IPAD.
I am not normally an apple fan. In my opinion apple makes products that are under-performing and overpriced but do a heck of a job marketing their products. The iphone is an exception for me. While it would be nice if it had flash or expandable memory, there are two reasons this is the best smart phone available. 1.) Build quality and interface on this phone are just better than every other smart phone. 2.) It keeps its value. While the phone will cost $200 with a new contract or upgrade, the phone will also cost $200 until the iphone 5 comes out. That means a week after I bought this phone I didn't have to worry about finding an internet deal offering the phone for free, like my friend found after purchasing his Droid X. To me this is a big deal.
Price is no better then anywhere else. The only reason best buy got the sale was they had it in stock. As far as the phone its self goes it is excellent. I love it.
All in all, this was a good purchase. The interface is intuitive, and the touchscreen in very responsive. The camera is amazing and I love the feature for taking self-portraits. There are tons of apps available for any i-phone user, and lots of them are free. I don't like that there is no radio receiver in the phone (it's only in the ipod nano?) and the ring tones that are stock on the phone are not anything I'd prefer. Also, programs automatically stay signed in until you physically select the "logout" command, which makes me wonder what's eating up data when I don't realize it...
Great item, great service. Best Buy in Doral is the only place to shop
Wish I had gotten 32g. Why not have the maximum space available.
It's good that it has a flash. Do wish the size the screen was as big as some of the android phones. Takes pretty good pics.
2nd iphone and love its ease of use. The clarity of images much better. Batterry life better vthen previoius iophone, but stil not too good.
This phone is easy to use and has a lot of nice features like the facetime and the camera. The battery life is a lot better as well. Overall I think it's an improvement over the old iphone 3G.
Much faster than the iPhone 3 it replaced, and the cameras are much better too.
I never knew what the big deal was with the iPhone until I got an iPod Touch... Then I upgraded to the iPhone because I was tired of carrying a phone, and my iPod. I couldn't be happier! I pay my bills, read my emails, play games, play movies, play music, surf the web - This thing is AWESOME! I've heard people complain about dropped calls, but I haven't had any more than I did when I was with Sprint. The battery life is as good as any phone... I listen to music all day at work, and play games and text/talk after I'm home, and I only have to charge it once a day (while I'm sleeping). If you're buying an iPhone without a plan, it is way too expensive! - But with a 2 year agreement, which I was going to have with someone anyways, it's only $200! That's cheaper than the 8Gb iPod touch! I've compared it to other phones, but nothing comes close, and the screen resolution is incredible! My only regret is that I didn't get the 32Gb model.
Bought the phone for my wife i already have one works great and would buy another one the additional services make me want to buy my daughters from them also
I bought my IPhone 4 on release day! I never had the signal issue that was "over rated" throughout the news and talked about among Apple haters! I love this phone! I use it everyday, it is blazing fast, and looks gorgeous!
I purchased the phone from Bestbuy, Roseville, MN. Sales person is very knowledgeable and patient to answer all of our questions (some dump questions as well) . We are very happy and glad that we made a right choice.
The apps are wonderful and makes it easier to get to weather and news updates. I live in a tornado prone area and the phone helps me keep on top of everything
Wish it was more open to other software then just itunes.
The iPhone 4 is so great using it. It also added some new features, HD Video quality and others. It is a much better than iPhone 3G 16 Smartphone. I am really enjoying using it. I did purchase a new otterbox defender case and it is a great way to protest iPhone 4 avoid break it when throw, drop, etc.
I love this phone but I wish the battery life will last longer. I have to recharge every night. I didn't had to do that with my previous phone. The blackberry. Other than that I love the features, apps, merging calls right from the screen. Etc....
I always look at purchases in terms of "use per dollar," and even though I've only owned the iPhone 4 for about a month now, I can honestly say I've already gotten my money's worth from it! I was a huge fan of the iPhone 3GS, so I guess it's no surprise that I think the iPhone 4 is wonderful, too. I am a bit concerned about my battery, though: the life has always been great, but about 2 days ago, it started depleting like crazy. Not sure what's going on, but I'm sure it can be fixed.
After my 15 yr old daughter grabbed my 3 GS and placed it in my dog's water dish, this was an unexpected early upgrade, but I absolutely love it. Although I do have few dropped calls here and there, the effect of that is so minimal to the experience I get using the phone for everything else in my life...staying connected on the go. FaceTime is a sweet addition, and I also just found the skype app which uses forward facing camera as well to make skype video calls from iPhone. Not to mention the HD camera, video creation with iMovie, retina display, and oh yea, it's also a 16 GB iPod...gimme a break, the device sells itself.
I had an Evo, which is a nice phone, but I didn't use many features on it. It might be because I already had an iPad and had all the apps, etc... that I wanted from iTunes already and didn't like the Android market as well. Bought the iPhone and in 5 minutes had it all programed with everything I wanted and I use it ALL THE TIME. LOVE IT!!!
My original purchase was an android phone. I didn't like it. I really like the I-phone plus my daughter moved back home and she has alot of apple products.
I have found I can do everything and more that I would want to on a phone. I love it!
I have always had windows smartphones. Before them I had a windows PDA. I tried the htc surround and returned it in 3 days. I got the Iphone 4. Best choice. It is the first phone that really works. The apps are amazing, sound and picture quality is great, phone connection is great. The only fault I have is that I miss the file folder system of windows, but am learning the Apple way.
Love my iPhone. had a blackberry torch keys too small for me. Swapped it out for the iPhone4 and could not be happier. Tons of apps love the multitasking function with AT&T iPhone
I liked this ok, calls were decent, but I returned it because after seeing some really high end Androids, and the Android line up that's coming in 2011 alone, it suddenly looked too small & too plain. Really clear screen but 3.5 is just tiny. I love media, and watching Netflix or other video was cramped, and browsing the web was cumbersome. I found myself scrolling a lot because of it's small screen. After a short while It just looked like a touch phone with sliding screens and app squares- nothing more. Wish they could add character, make the waste of space bezels above the screen, and below, more useful. (Like maybe make it a "4 screen at the minimum.) I loved the apps, but there's just something about a phone with screen character that's more appealing to me. I like being able to see the weather at a glance, see my daily/weekly schedule and tasks right on the screen. These things are supposed to be PDA/smartphones right? Then more Personal Digital Assistance would be nice. I shouldn't have to go inside certain apps just to see the important things. I want those things in my face at a glance. Seeing clips of my texts, emails, facebook, and twitter updates, also right there on the screen, would be an added bonus- that's nice too. I work from my phone and I get mass text messages, so another thing that I hated was having to delete all my text messages 1 at a time. What's that all about? A "Delete All" option has been around since the dawn of texting. Also hated the fact that I couldn't choose what numbers I wanted to delete in the recent call list. It was all or nothing. I used it heavily, so I was constantly having to charge it. I could have purchased a battery charging case, but I like thin phones. Switching out the battery is way nicer. I can have one charging at all times, then I can simply just swap it out and go. Constant power. One more thing that I found weird was how cheap the VERY expensive charge/sync cable is. It frays at the ends so quickly. At 32 bucks for a replacement cable, it should last 2-3 years. They could fix this easily by just adding some flex wrap at the ends. But I'm sure that will not be changed soon or ever, since it is the same sync cord they've been using since the iPod. I'm just very surprised with the cord's low durability. Overall these quips are perhaps only bothersome to me. The average user, based on iPhone sales alone, probably doesn't care much about these things, or they probably do and have more than likely jailbroken it so they can actually give it the character it lacks. That's got to be it, because I can't imagine that jailbreaking would be so extremely popular if people enjoyed it in its present state. I figured if I have to jailbreak it just to enjoy it, and then always have to worry about the next Apple update that will for sure ruin that jailbreak, then wait for someone to put out an update for that jailbreak so that I can finally update my phone to the latest Apple update, lose any warranty on it because of the jailbreaks, then it's just not worth it to me. All that hassle just so I can delete all my text messages at once, and see the weather and my schedule on the screen? Plus I have to constantly buy an overly expensive sync cable that last much less time than a normal sync cable? Forget it.
Oh wow! It's almost as exciting as bringing my children home after giving birth! This iphone is spectacular. At my local store it is not on display but they keep it in stock pretty well. The phone is like top secret because it's a gem! It is very easy to use and there is a website on the phone to tell you anything you may not know how to do. The apps- live up to the hype just like the whole phone does. The battery life- is very good. This is my 3rd smartphone and one of them was a blackberry with an excellent battery life. I was leary that the battery life on the iphone 4 would not last long but considering all the apps and fun, it lasts very well. I did tons of research on iphone verses android. I made the right decision!
Much better phone then the 3G or 3Gs. Faster and esier to use also.
I've tried the Android phones but the interface is not intuitive. I also tried to use a blackberry but the buttons are small and hard to use, it's also not intuitive when looking for many things. After months with other phones, I switched to the iPhone. It is SO much easier to use. I can find apps with ease. I can't think of anything that is easier to do on ANY other phone. Even connecting and syncing my phone with my computer is easier. BY FAR, the best smart phone on the market.
This was my second choice for a new phone. I really wanted a Windows phone, but had many technical issues with that phone. I was informed by AT & T to take back Windows phone and get I Phone which I did. When they transferred contacts they were all transferred wrong. I have over 250 contacts and had to edit each one individually and correct each one. Also when you download any app free or otherwise you have to go to Itunes. With the windows phone you didn't have to do that. Just download and it would be charged to your phone. Also to find an app you have to scroll through pages once you have downloaded some apps. With windows phone they were alphabetized in one list. Much simpler to find. Another problem I have had with IPhone is the email feature. When I read email on my computer and save it, and then access my email later from the IPhone it shows that the mail is unread even though I read it on the computer. Furthermore the IPhone loads all my spam email into my inbox instead of a spam folder. I have no spam folder on the IPhone. Finally I do not make or recevie that many calls on a daily basis but have to recharge the battery at least once if not more each day. All in all I can't wait until my 2 years are up and I can trade the IPhone in for a windows phone. I hope by then they will have all the bugs worked out of the windows phone.
This is my 3rd iPhone and as the years go by they keep getting better. I love the screen and camera's on this phone!
I bought the IPod touch first. I fell in love with the apps and needed a Phone so I returned the iPod and bought the iPhone instead. Best self gift ever!!
I like the phone - It is easy to use - lots of apps - music sounds good
This phone is great, I love it. There are a lot of things I still don't know how to use on it, but I am working through them with help from user guide and my son.
This is my first smart phone and I am impressed not only by the hardware but the APPS that make the phone so useful and fun. WI-FI capability minimizes data usage. The 5meg camera is great and I have found I use it frequently. I have made photos of price tags in stores, of repair projects and parts for reference, as well as anything I want to document. There are so many free APPS that are useful. I don't have any game type APPS, but do use ones for shopping, fitness, medical info, weather, sports updates, etc. The GPS is amazing. The synchronization of my contacts and calendar with Outlook is a handy feature plus, the phone charges while plugged into the USB port. Although it is well designed, I purchased a protective cover/skin/case.
I had the Iphone when it first came out and got rid of it soon after. So when I finally got the new 4 I really like the changes they have made. The battery life still sucks and I don't like the fact that they took the docking station for charging away, and it keeps having some delays, but all in all it has been a pretty good phone.
I had been contemplating an iPhone for some time and finally chose the iPhone 4 16GB. I totally dig thus far.
Apple never disappoints! I've had an iPhone since Apple first released the phone and this is the best one yet.
The IPhone 4 is the best tech gadget I've ever owned.
When first asking different retailers about the difference between the 3 verisions of iphones, I was told the only thing that had changed is the face time feature. I was pleasanlty surprised that the Internet was much faster, the camera much better, and there had been so many other changes that made the phone a great buy. I love it! No buyers remorse for me.
Love the ease of checking e-mails, texts and phone messages. Hard to type and can't hang up phone when text messages come. Prefer to any other phone I've had, though.
Love this phone. Takes fantastic pictures, video. Nice large screen. Easy to use.
Easy to use, reliable, and the best PDA phone there is
I studied a lot of smart phone reviews for quite a while. I finally bit the bullet and bought the i Phone 4. I have to say that I am more please than I thought I would be. I love this device and all it can do. At first I was disappointed that there wasn't a users guide in the box, but with the ease of getting it on the i Phone itself or the PC ... that disappointment went away. My i Phone is almost the first thing I want to grab when I get up in the a.m.
I'm really happy with the magnificent display and faster processing power in iPhone 4 compared to my old 3G version. But I am experiencing dropped calls every now and then. So to avoid that I have to make sure I'm in a better reception area where i have atleast 2 or more signal bars.
I am a new IPHONE user so at first I'm somewhat hesitant to try the other features as I may delete something that shouldn't be deleted. As I get used to it, with the help of my nephew and niece who have IPHONEs for couple years, I love it although I still don't use Facebook and emails. I still prefer my computer to do that as this has bigger screen. Maybe I will use these IPHONE apps in the future. I wish the price is lower for 2-yr contract like $99 only.
Great phone! Love the apps and the trendy look and feel!
I love the phone, i just hate charging it twice, even three times a day.
The display and features of this phone are exactly what I was looking for. It is very easy to use and I get excellent reception. It is a bit pricey for something you can get on other platforms for almost the same thing, but overall I am very pleased.
i like my new iphone 4! cant wait for iphone 5 & new Ipad .
I went from a 1st gen to this one. It was an impressive jump, good thing I didn't go through a 3GS phase. Performance is great but not perfect. Iphone would do best if it monitored more closely on it's own multitasking as several apps often crash unless you have closed them on the recently used apps feature (double tap home button). I didn't have too many instances of this problem with my 1st gen. All else is awesome, I love the camera and the light most of all. That was the main reason to upgrade and it's always with me. I gave it 4 out of five stars for not being factory unlocked or atleast giving you that option when your contract is done. Also I've had a few dropped calls at the begining but quite sporadic and no more lately.
I bought this for my wife who gave me her old iphone. I feel the prices for these phones are too high, but they do make life easier and have tons of things you can do on them. My wife can't live w/out it, so I guess that makes it a hit.
I can use it for so many things, it's great! Best present ever!
Upgraded from the 3GS and it's a whole world of difference... apps load faster, photos take quicker and MUCH clearer... everything about it is great!
I bought this for my daughter. There to many restrictions on using it.She loves ring tones for her phone just way to difficult to put something as simple as ring tones on her phone.
I always wanted a new phone, and I was surprised at Christmas with an iphone. I love how easy it is to use and the apps are a lot of fun.
By now the iPhone isn't the only player in the game. Android OS looks just as good (in some cases better) on paper, but iOS still trumps other smartphone OS' in one major [yet subjective] category: user experience. No need to jailbreak iOS for multitasking, home screen and lock screen wallpapers and tethering anymore, as it's all here standard. Aside from performance boosts, iPhone 4 has been restyled since the 3GS model. It is now glass on both the front and the back, with a stainless stell band (that's actually the WiFi and 3G antennae) along the edges. While it's sleek and quite beautiful, I'd recommend getting a case on it immediately. The 4th gen iPhone also sports a new screen, dubbed Retina by Apple. THIS is the reason to upgrade from previous iPhone models. The new screen is amazing at 326 dpi, making everything (especially text) super clear and crisp. In addition to the new display, the phone now has a gyroscope (used in games and some cool augmented reality apps), front-facing camera for video calls over wifi, and a LED flash for the rear camera, which is capable of HDR photos and 720p video. Overall, though, if iPhone didn't interest you before, it likely won't now. Just do your homework when phone shopping; there's plenty of info available online.
It's not just an AT&T problem but a serious design flaw. My 3G s was so much better. Stutter-step texting, Garbled voices, dropped calls. It's just bad. Apple knows it too. They need to make this right by all of us that coughed up for this debacle!
It is my life saver! I love it and can not live without it! Get it you will not regret this purchase!
I have bought from bestbuy, it is aperfect phone I have ever had
I love the iphone. I only wish that I had waited for Verizon. I hope that ATT pushes hard to get their network stronger.
and im not having any trouble with the AT&T service at all .. no dropped calls .. no bad connections and no hidden fee's ive seen other ppl mention. I love everything about my iPhone 4 and so glad i waited to get this one!!!
Really like this phone. It has great features. Adding apps is easy too. Sure makes sharing information and finding information a snap. My only concern it the battery life but then I am using it several hours a day so that does put a drain on the battery. It does charge up quickly though. I turned on the percent charge to display so I know exactly what I have left. Would recommend this phone to others.
For instance there is a free gps function free for I phone4 that allows you to pinpoint your phone if lost. It costs $100 a year if you don't have iphone4
Works great, lots faster than the 3G it replaced. Love the new OS features.
Great phone. Would be 5 stars if we could do useful functionality wihout paying extra or jailbreaking. Mainly I would like to be able to tether or create a hotspot. I use an otterbox defender case (always get a case for idevices) for the phone, and I carry it in my pocket without problems.
It worth the money you pay. is easy to use and I love the quality of photos it takes. Also I like because I can print wherever I want.
Awesome totally love it!!! I got it for Christmas. I origianlly did not want one.
These are our first "does something more than phone" phones and we love them. We did not expect to. Every day we discover something new that they do that is fun. We are careful yet to stay with free apps, but have started to purchase some. The only desire we have is that they would do face to face when not in a wifi area.
Already had the iPod touch but I wanted the phone features and the camera with face time. If I could have the new IPod touch with camera and other new features, I would never buy this phone. It uses web data usage even when you don't think you're using it. Short battery life, can't use Flash (just like the touch) unlike my kid's Android phone that can do everything, can't get ringtones and apps through AT&T or anywhere else--just Itunes, lighting on camera stinks, and face time scares even me and I'm pretty.;).
I own iPad, iPod Touch and now, the iPhone. I did so because I wanted to have all of my electronic devices under the Apple umbrella. It makes for easy use. The iPhone is a great device. The only problem I have with it is that Apple can't seem to work out an agreement with Adobe, so that the device can support Flash video. Other than that, it's the best phone out there.
Since this was a Christmas present to myself I am so thankful that I LOVE LOVE LOVE this phone! I am also thankful that seemingly all of the old bugs and kinks are out of the iphones because I can honestly say that since I have had the phone (only two months old) I have not had any dropped calls and it is working great. I am still learning how to use it but my favorite things to do are to listen to books on tape that I download from my public library, listen to the music I download from itunes, AND reading books on the ibook and nook books for iphone! Get it!! This phone is worth it!!! :) Enjoy!
Wish it came in different colors but love it anyway!
I love my iPhone. It's never too far out of reach. I would suggest getting a case and screen protector for it as the screen gets rather dirty from finger prints. I love the apps especially when I find them for free.
Have had alot of different phones over the years, " This Apple iphone has got it all......so easy to use.
Battery has to be charged every evening, can't access app's, drops calls or fades out, sometimes it doesn't ring, just vibrates, takes good pictures but I have a nice camera for that, if I hadn't signed a 2 yr contract I would cancel and go back to a cheap phone without all the extra unusable garbage.
I am hooked on my Blackberry, but my spouse had an iPhone 4 and really wanted me to get the same - for facetime, etc. Because we had an iPhone 3GS that was still under contract, in order to get the iPhone 4, I had to pay the full price. Honestly, it was worth it. I did not feel that way right out of the gate, but it did not take long to see some of the benefits the iPhone 4 had over my Blackberry 8310 Curve. The iPhone 4 works perfectly with my Bluetooth headset for phone calls and listening to music (the 3GS did not). The graphics in emails typically appear on the iPhone, whereas they do not on the Blackberry. The 8310 Curve (Blackberry) is not wi-fi, whereas the iPhone 4 is. The list goes on (camera quality, dual camera, compass,etc.). The biggest downside I have been able to find with the iPhone 4 is that you cannot search emails - or if you can, I haven't figured out how yet. I receive numerous emails from a handful of accounts, and Blackberry is a clear winner - but that is about the only category that it wins, hands down. Even the battery life (a common criticism of earlier iPhone models) does not seem to be too bad at all. I still carry my Blackberry at work, but right when I leave the office - and all weekend long - the iPhone 4 is my hip companion. I did not feel the same about the iPhone 3GS or earlier versions my spouse carried of the iPhone. The iPhone 4 really did change everything for me - mainly my feelings towards the iPhone.
From apps that organize and simplify almost every aspect of your lifestyle, to games, internet browsing, and entertainment, this phone does it all. I never realized how much easier things could get before getting it. It even saves you $$$ by allowing you to compare prices when shopping via its web browser or free apps. The only con is that you'll need to charge the the battery daily since the iPhone uses a lot of juice. But its really the only downside I could find.
I heard a lot of reluctance from others but this phone is awsome. The screen is unbelieveable. There are tons of free aps. The camera,video is better than most I've seen. excellent item
Got this for my college-age son even after advising him to get an Android phone. A few weeks later he admitted he wishes he got an Android phone.
If I didn't had to exchange it after 2 weeks. I couldn't get signal inside stores (groceries, post office, etc) and it worked really poorly inside my home (wireless). After trying all the resets and instructions from the apple's website, I went to an apple store and this guy exchange it for a new one. Now is perfect and I love it.
If you are going to buy a computer why buy anything but Apple? These phones are tiny computers with a calling option. Love my iPhone will not get anything else.
Had a 3G before upgrading and have seen many different smart phones out on the market from all the major carriers. The iPhone 4 is definitely the easiest to use, most flexible, and slickest one out there. The only bad thing is, I have AT&T and not Verizon.
The iPhone 4 has got to be the best phone ever. Atleast until the next iPhone comes out.
Everyone knows iPhones are the best! It's true what they say... "Once you go Mac, you don't go back!"
I like the phone very friendly for user, the only problem is the bluetooth connection not very good, cut off regularly. I try many bluetooth i.e. soundid, plantronic, jawbone and motorola still have connectivity issue. SoundID seem to work better than most, because it made for Iphone. The one problem is that you can hear fine, but the other people can not understand you sound like you speaking under water
Got two of these. One for me and one for the Wife. I had the 3Gs before. noticeably faster. FACETIME IS GREAT! Get a case for it I recommend the Otterbox.
This is by far the best phone I have ever had, and I have had the original Iphone and the 3GS. I held off for a long time getting this phone due to all the antenna issues and was trying to hold out for the release of the white one to see if any changes were made but gave in and bought this phone. Best choice I've made dealing with phones. This IPhone 4 blows my last IPhone away in speed and has better reception providing there is a case or bumper on the phone. The antenna issue is still there and you will lose reception if you touch the antenna with your hand, but I bought a nice thin case from best buy and the phone works flawlessly.
This gadget is an amazing one , totally changed my life.
Awesome phone! Despite all the negative reviews, if your considering purchasing an iPhone, don't hesitate to do so! Touch screen is incredibly fast and very accurate. Great camera and iPod!!! The network problems are just that, at&t problems not the iPhone!! Get this phone!!
I'm so happy with this phone. This is my fourth buy for my family. All 4 of us have one. It's fast , easy to use, lots of apps, great music player, and awesome screen. I love it.
This is a great phone. You can tell by its construction, its functions and the packaging. They're all first rate. Its GPS feature is very good and the smoothness of operation make it a breeze to use. However, it constantly loses connection with my Plantronics bluetooth headset. This occurs even if the phone is in my left shirt pocket and the headset in on my right ear. I've also found that sitting next to a compact fluorescent bulb interferes with it. Apple acknowledged that and said they are working on a solution. They suggested I buy an Apple bluetooth headset. Not likely at $129.00. This is a great phone, but if it wasn't offered at $199.00 for a service renewal, there is no way I would have paid the retail price for it, or the same amount for any other phone.
There is very little to criticize about the I-Phone 4. The front facing camera is a welcome addition, but you must have a wi-fi connection to use "face time". The great screen resolution and virtually unlimited aps make this the phone to own
easy to sync with multiple programs; easy to stream music/movies.
I have 3 3gs phones in the family and now two 4's. The neat thing with the 4's is the dual camera and the video. While you need to be on a wifi to use the feature, that is not so bad, since I really use it to speak with my son and it is generally from two fixed sites. I do not need the video feed for a quick hit, so the wifi is not a killer point. We actually have successfully used the 3gs phones to also do video calls...it just takes the right apps and turning the phone. Not optimal but it works! With the next phone I will look at a droid, but AT&T's selection is limited right now and I do not want to change carriers due to some legacy pricing.
The battery life on this thing is second to none. The display is gorgeous! The camera is much better and the video skype is so awesome! Highly recommend this phone!
I LOVE my iPhone like I love my right arm! You will too
This new version is better and somewaht faster than the earlier versions, but it still faces the same dropped calls and disconnects to the internet that AT&T seems to always exhibit. There are always coverage dead spots and 3G strength even varies from minute to minute in the same location. But did does seem to have a longer battery life though that needs to be extended in future versions.
good but battery still needs improvement. Scrren is much clearer and brighter
I love this phone. Ive had android and now the iphone and this easily blows it away. the retina screen is by far the best you will find on the market. The battery life is pretty bad tho. When the phone is on hold it uses a ton of battery.
The Iphone is so much fun to use. I love all the apps. It was very easy to learn how to use. The picture is beautiful. Battery life is much better than my wife's iphone 3.
I was nervous switching from my Palm Treo that I've had for many years. As a stay at home mom with three active kids, I heavily relied on the PDA to keep our multiple family member's calendars. I was afraid I would not find a phone with a calendar feature to match that of the Palm's. I was also afraid I wouldn't be able to adjust fast enough. I didn't know if I would be able to type fast enough on the Apple's virtual keyboard. I was very pleased when I found that I was able to jump right in and use the calendar. I was able to easily maneuver around the keyboard. It took a couple of days to learn all the features. It also took me several hours to input all my contacts and calendar info. I did not look into whether I could do it automatically. (By doing it manually I could leave out many old contacts that I did not need anymore.) I am really enjoying my iphone! I always say to people, "This phone is my life!"
I bought the iPhone 4 as a replacement for my old BlackBerry Curve and it was like someone handed me an ice cold glass of water after crawling through a hot desert. It has everything that I want and need, and nothing i don't. The design of the phone is just gorgeous. The glass on the front and the back is engineered to be 30x's harder than plastic. This combined with the high grade steel frame create a durable scratch resistant package. When you turn the phone on, the first thing you notice is the clarity of the display. You cannot see the pixels on the screen unless you literally hold it an inch from your eyes. The 5 megapixel camera takes stunning photos that look crystal clear on the display. The colors are very accurate for a phone camera. The "tap to focus" is also a nice feature. Another thing I noticed right away is how quickly apps loaded compared to my 2nd generation iPod Touch. Apps that took up to 30 seconds to load on my iPod load almost instantly on the iPhone 4. With all of these great capabilities, I was afraid that the battery might not be able to keep up, but the battery life is phenomenal. My battery lasts between 2-4 days depending on how much I use it. One of the biggest selling points for me was the seamless connectivity with iTunes. All I had to do was plug it onto my computer and it automatically synced my music library, videos, contacts, and all the apps that were previously on my iPod touch. The 6 axis gyroscope adds a whole new dimension to gaming apps. Just like the accelerometer, the gyroscope is very accurate. One thing I realized though is that the gyroscope doesn't work well in the car. When the car goes around a corner, your game goes off the screen! (Well you shouldn't be playing games while driving anyway). I had heard a lot of complaints about the iPhone 4 and even more about AT&T service, but I haven't experienced any issues with the phone or service so far in the two months I've owned it. This phone is just perfect!
Overall this is the phone that sets the bar for all others. It is small and sexy and easy to use. It is so intuitive it is ridiculous. Biggest issue is: what happens if the phone drops? So far have not had that problem but am curious to find out whether the phone really needs a case... cases make the phone much bulkier than without and if I do not need one why bother? Would love to here from others their experience. Otherwise be happy that iphone is now carried by Verizon so there is no longer a monopoly.
I can now carry around one piece of equipment, instead of two or three. Every thing I need; Phone, camera, camcorder, game player, etc. etc., and everything works like a charm. Even my photos are good quality and the movies are fantastic. It looks like I'll be trading in my two camcorders and my PSP.
I have had the iPhone 2, 3GS, and now the 4. Each has worked very well for my needs. I love the fact that I can plug it into my computer and transfer songs, photos, calender events, and contacts very easily. No need to sit down for an hour trying to hand jam information into a new phone. I still use my 3GS, and I have an iPad. So I got a mobile me account to make it even easier to share calender events and contacts without have to plug each one in to get an update. The iPhone had some issues in the beginning, I have not had any with mine so far.
all i hear from verizon users is how worthless the iphone is. they love their droid. sure some droid operating phones do things better on some levels but all around the ipnone is the best phone you can get. the only phone that can come close is the evo. the iphone has the clearest screen, the smoothest operating system, the easiest to use operating system and does face talk or skype very well. if you shut down programs from running in the background (which is super easy to do), you can extend battery life substantially and it also allows your phone to charge very quickly as well.of course battery life is not going to be as long as a standard phone, but for a smart phone, it holds a good charge. driod phones? the only people who would pick those over the iphone are the ones who choose to be ignorant. get an iphone. you wont be sorry.
what more can be said,its apple and an iphone 4. i love it does everything form calendar, music a true one stop and holds all my info.
The quality and craftsmanship of the iPhone hardware is unmatched by any Android. I've been intimately involved in the Android/OS debate, owned both, and in the end I prefer iOS. The OS may not be as flashy as Android, but it is extremely stable. Plus I have not found a replacement for iTunes when it comes to media content management. While iTunes leaves much to be desired, I appreciate being able to manage transferring playlists, movies, Podcasts, TV episodes, & applications to my phone via one piece of software.
Had to buy new iPhone 4 because my 3Gs was stolen. I was very happy with my old phone, but was told I could not keep my unlimited plan unless I bought the new iPhone 4. For about 550.00 dollars later I pretty much had my old phone with a new camera and video. It is nice when I go Offshore, as I am able to check email and other such apps. quickly.
I upgraded because my old 3g was getting so slow on the new iOS. I could tell right away that the hardware was the issue. My phone works as fast as I expect it too now that I upgraded to the iPhone 4. I hate the fact that you can't hold the iPhone 4 without a case. Because of that I think I paid to much for a phone with such a HUGE design flaw. Did any of the engineers hold the phone before they manufactured it? I would hold out for the iPhone 5 if the slow hardware doesn't bother you.
i thought i would have problems using the i phone but decided to give it try and i'm so happy i did. it's pretty easy to figure things out by yourself so if your not real good at computers and such don't be afraid of this phone. the texting is easy, the camera takes great clear pictures and the videos are just fun. iv'e had no problems with dropped calls or bad reception and at&t has been very helpful when needed, which has not been a lot. Treat yourself to an i phone
I have been a proud iPhone 4 owner since August 2010 and have been preaching the good word of Apple. The iPhone 4 is an ultimate powerhouse. It is like a miniature Mac in the palm of your hand and then some. This is the best design of the iPhone I've ever seen Apple come up with. It is beyond its time and is a little bundle of brilliance. The iPhone 4's 5 megapixel camera with LED flash and HDR photography is one of the best mobile phone cameras out there. Many times, I've seen my iPhone 4's camera take better pictures when compared to some of my friends' Droids, which boasts an 8 megapixel camera. Apple focuses less on quantity and more on quality. The camera also records full HD video and has it's own movie editing app from Apple, known as iMovie. There is an additional front facing camera of lesser quality, designed for video chats (either with Skype or FaceTime) as well as taking self portraits. This iPhone comes in 16 and 32 GB flash storage capacities with 512 mb of RAM. The 960x640 retina display is higher than any other smartphone out there right now. I did have a couple of dropped calls when I first got it, but very few. I no longer get dropped calls unless service is lacking and I think Apple/AT&T has worked this out. The glass on the phone is tough! I've dropped my phone without a case by accident twice onto the tile and only received minor scratches. The new processor shows its strength. This iPhone is very speedy. I can load a full website in a matter of seconds. iOS is one of the most advanced mobile platforms, yet it's the easiest to use. Everything flows smoothly without flaw. The phone itself will not crash on you (though third party apps can) and the platform is tight and secure so you needn't worry about information being stolen. I highly recommend iPhone 4. It is so capable and powerful, yet such a breeze to use. You don't have to be a techie to figure out this phone.
The iPhone 4 is great for anything, with all those handy dandy apps for it. I have face time with my mother because she has one too. The graphics are stunning! It looks so crisp and nice, and the pictures are excelent! I love the iPhone 4!!!!
iphone 4 is like having a computer in your pocket but i'm sure you already know this!
iPhone 4 is the best iPhone release to date. Touting an improved camera, 720p video recording, voice commands, new design, and better screen resolution. Best of all is the battery life. Lasts twice as long as the 3G, especially after the new ios4.2 Of course the phone is missing flash, animated backgrounds, and voice gps but its other features and reliability make it the best in the market. I have never had dropped calls!
I waited so long to get the iphone. I used to have T-mobile and changed to At&t just to have the iphone. This phone is very easy to use. Has great features. Very easy to input your email to Mail. The only complain I have is that the battery doesn't last long. I used to have the old blackberry curve and the battery would last up 3 days. With this phone I have to charge it every night so that was a bummer. I hear the battery life on the iphone 4 is better than the older iphone's so I can't imagine how often you would have to charge the older iphone versions. Despite the battery life I still love my iphone. I haven't had any problems with dropped calles. The sales person told me that if i had only 1 or 2 bars in a certain areas to turn off the 3G and the phone would get its reception from the 2G towers. I tried it and now I have full reception at home.
I returned my Iphone 4 after that I was in love. I was really disappointed. Pros: Good Model (Apple is good on it) Good graphic interface (Apple is good on it) Cons: Limitation in features (you can't customize it) Only you have to use Itunes to access to your phone No support Adobe Flash. So you can't see websites designed in Flash and Youtube video embed in the website. it will need to relaunch other application. Data plan is not unlimited (be careful with you bill every month if you surf a lot or download mp3 or apps.
I will be honest. I hate my new iphone. I talk on the phone about 10 or 15 times a day and my phone is dropping the calls at least half of the time. I never had a problem with my 3G. I have had my phone in a case since I left the store so I am not sure I buy the whole thing that a case helps the antennae issue. I lost my other phone so had to get a new one. I raved about my other Iphone ....not doing so this time. The graphics are a little better maybe, but I am very disappointed. Stick with the 3G.
i would love it but hate that it got smaller i love apple but dont that they made the iphone smaller
I got rid of Verizon so I could sign up and get this phone. It was my first iphone. At first I reallllllly loved it. I think i liked it more for show and bragging rights than really "liking" it. After awhile It would drop a ton of calls. Alllllllll the time. Texting was kind of a pain in the rear because the letters are so close together. I didnt like how I had to purchase ringtones through itunes either. I usually use one of those free sites and with this phone you cant do that or get any sort of music forwarded to you and save it. I LOVED the camera. I have a 4 year old and took professional quality pictures with this phone..esp after downloading the free photoshop app. I didnt like how most of the apps cost at least $1.99 or the free ones would be demos. I was dissipointed in that. The speaker at first was amazing but it seemed like after 2 weeks it went way down. The battery life isnt bad for how much i used it. The main things I used was the facebook app and maps but they froze alot and i found myself re-downloading them a lot. Also...I put it on my computer to charge and without knowing it synced with my itunes and deleted EVVVVVVVVVVVERYTHING in my photos and videos. im talking about over 400 pictures and videos of my son ill never be able to get back. after that i was over it..soon after it broke after dropping it on the ground.
Im totally inclusively happy with iphone 4G .. lots of new features that made it easier to use, the apps grouping, the app stip, 2 sided vid cam, photo flash light!!!, battery life, developed email feature .. and many more .. its worth every penny I paid for it ..
Just recently updated from an iPhone 3G to the iPhone 4 and it is just fantastic. The phone is leaps and bounds better then what I had. It's like having a laptop that can make calls.
this phone is amazing!!!! i am happy with it.......
This is my very first iphone. Great look and design. Retina screen is beautiful. Apps are outstanding, easy to use and the battery life is vey good. I love this phone!
I've had an iPhone 3G for the past couple of years and recently upgraded it to the iPhone 4. As great as the 3G was it can't compare to the 4.
This upgrade of the iPhone is the best upgrade yet. So many great features. I relied on my old iPhone. I have no idea how I would function without this one. My new right arm.
I purchased this phone four weeks ago and I am very happy with this product. Battery life is long; applications are very interesting and it's very easy to use it.
I had the iPhone 3G and traded it in for the iPhone4, I'm glad I did this phone is so much faster than my old iPhone.
There is nothing to add to what already have been said: iPhone is the best!
As a diehard PC guy, this review is like visiting the dentist; however, "give credit where credit is due". The updates in the IPhone 4 or my 3G was well worth it. HD Video aside, the battery life and faster processor would have been enough. Throw in face time and an updated retina display...can't miss purchase. :-)
iPhone doesn't need much reviews - it's a great phone, the only thing that bothers me so far - is short battery life
I had an original iPhone 3G and despite limited battery capacity, I loved it. I was ready for a new battery when the iPhone 4 came out, so I upgraded. I am very disappointed with the number of dropped calls I have with this phone - a problem I simply didn't have with the iPhone 3G. In retrospect, I'd have been better off getting the new battery.
***Waited three months to get this phone, and it is well worth the wait. Am thoroughly enjoying some of the apps (Dragon Dictation is my favorite). ***All settings imported perfectly from previous phone. Signal inside house is more reliable than previous phone (I used to have to go outside to talk). Signals inside stores are also much more reliable. With old phone I had to go near the outside door. Now I can talk or check internet reviews even in the back. ***Had a problem with proximity sensor, but found that was caused by using a case designed for older generation iPhone. Sliding phone partially out of case fixes the problem. ***Looking forward to using FaceTime with my twins when they go to college next year.
I have owned Blackberry's, HTC's, Motorola and none of those phones compares to this. My last phone was a HTC and I hated it. It was so slow and I could not understand it. I was debating whether or not on getting the Iphone because of the reception/antenna issues I had heard about. I cancelled my contract and paid an early temination fee to get this phone and I do not regret it at all. I absolutely love this phone. I have had it for a week and have not had any problems with it. I get good signal and have not had a dropped call yet. It is an amazing phone and I am glad I made this purchase. If you don't know whether you should buy this phone, I think you should go ahead and go for it. You will not regret getting it!
The phone works great, I think it was Consumer Digest said they cannot recommend sale of the iPhone 4 cause of dropped calls & antenna. If you turn off 3G phone works just fine NO DROPPED CALLS in coverage area. AT&T need to step up their game & improve the 3G service.
When it comes to buying a smartphone, Iphone 4 lives up to its reputation in bring the best technology in cell phones. I've owned a iphone 3g for two years and not once had any major problems with it. The iphone 4 has more features that the third generation iphone and it is a lot easier that the competitors smartphone. I am a true iphone customer and would not settle for any other smartphone brand!
I love the iPhone 4, just wish the battery could last longer. I got the phone because it could do so much on the go, I just have to find time to re-charge it throughout the day. The screen is amazing, the camera is better than I could have hoped for.
This is my third iPhone. The only thing I don't like about it is how it feels in your hand because it is more squared. Other than that, it is amazing and much better than all the others. I especially like the face time feature.
Wow, the screen is awesome, very crisp and bright. It's fast and snappy in the navigation and overall use. Great warrantee and support.
It's tough to say which is worse, the phone from apple or the service from at&t. The phone freezes too much, has issues with backing up on itunes and has issues with re-sizing screen images. At&t is just horrible, terrible service. I am on Edge network more than 3G which makes web browsing and apps almost impossible to use and I have trouble connecting calls and get dropped about 20% of the time, very frustrating. I had the 3GS phone and wish I would have never upgraded, no value and no benefit. It also means I have a new 2 year agreement with at&t which was a mistake. I have every apple product on the market and several of their new ones are disappointing, most recently this phone and the new ipod touch. I will be cautious with all apple purchases going forward.
Pro: Incredible display (razor sharp, unlike any other display I have seen before) Battery life greatly enhanced compared to 3GS Excellent camera functions, especially with available add-on apps Email on the road, in conjunction with me.com, is a godsend and works flawlessly with automatic syncing with all my other computers Con: Typing has to be relearned because of different device form factor AT&T coverage is not very good, and they are not doing anything about it.
Pleased with service and new IPhone. New features, battery life, contacts.
Excellent screen, User-friendly software, need to improve reception signal
Not only is this a great phone, but it's also a pretty nifty computer. If you're thinking about taking the plunge into an iPhone 4, just do it already. You won't regret it.
Everything I wanted and was looking for, and then some!
I have never had an Iphone before I love the apps.
Had to buy my wife the iphone 4 after she looked at my iphone 4 (32GB). She likes the facetime...I think some bugs need to be fixed. The best part was that I only paid $10.81 for the phone...I love reward points (I forgot that my points were set to $500 coupon and I had almost $300 in coupons).
Wife has an iPhone 3GS. I wanted a smart phone and was suckered into a AT&T Samsung Galaxy S Captivate...nice screen, decent price. What I didn't like was all the bloatware and lack of an ability to delete it. To top it, battery life was terrible (drained itself overnight) and the phone managed to download a ton of data overnight. Next day...took the phone back to BB and switched to iPhone 4. Easy interface...great screen, slim/sleek design. Battery life is much better than my Droid, and on par with my wife's 3GS. I needed a cover though to keep my signal strength from being attenuated...I do live in a weak coverage area in the mountains of Asheviille, NC, so that contributes to the issue of wavering signal strength. AT&T has a way to go in terms of providing coverage in our area...heck just got 3G coverage in the last year. Bought an Invisishield to protect the screen. Tried multiple cases in order to find one that would not cause the Invishield to peel o the edge. Found that the iFrogz Luxe Lean works best, and is the cleanest look/feel. Did I say I love this phone!
I sold the EVO on eBay after the 2.2 Android upgrade screwed so many things up (like Pandora streaming quality), and bit the bullet to go with AT&T and the iPhone 4. Have not regretted it. Everything is so much more polished with iOS than Android. It's no comparison. Even though there are no widgets and the like, everything runs flawlessly, multitasking is spot-on and the whole thing is just to intuitive. In my first month, with a lot of data usage, streaming, news, Netflix and other apps, I used about 1.3GB -- so nowhere near the 2GB cap I have. Facetime works wonderfully, unlike Qik did on the EVO (which had the most appalling battery life of any phone I have seen). The iPhone's battery life is great compared to the Android phones I have had, and the quality/fit&finish is mils ahead of anything this side of Nokia.
I love this phone. It's easy to use and manage all the applications I want to use. Pictures come out great.
we took my new phone with us to our vacation in new york city and what a great thing to have with us. the maps app was great to help us locate the attractions and buildings we wanted to visit. i could keep everyone up to date on our trip with facebook posts. i kept a journal of all the events we saw and done. this was the best purchase we could have made. taking pictures and videos was great to have, also.
I love the speed and the phone is easy to use. Great features. Works great for business and personal use. scs
I was cautious about upgrading but this iPhone shows all the improvements needed and worth the money. At the same price as my 3GS and coupled with the trade in that I did with Best Buy. No regrets.
Phone is not as good, plus it freezes, acts out...
I had the iphone 3G and it was ok, but this really is an improvement. Better Call quality, Video Chat, Records in 720HD, and much faster processor. The battery life is somewhat better, but still needs charging about once every 24-36 hours.
First IPhone its GREAT!! Everything in the palm of your hand!!
was a previous iphone user and updated to the iphone 4. Love it!
My Iphone4 Crashed 10 days after I bought it and I lost all my pix and info store in the phone. Apple was more than happy to replace the phone but the new replacement have this pop up that say Voicemail password is incorrect. Interesting part is I don't even have a password for my voice mail and I don't have any voice mail. The Face time feauture only works on a wi fi connections. So whats up with that? A bit disappointed costumer
Very nice! I wish I could buy it earlier. Just Love it!
The iPhone for is an all around great product. It is fun and easy to use. Great phone, great tool, all around great product. I highly recommend it!
I love my iphone4 i can pretty much do anything with it. I can keep track of all my daily things with it. Including school and work.
High def screen is amazing love the camera & all the capabilities!!!
The phone I owned before the iPhone was an HTC Tilt 2 which was an amazing phone. The graphics were astounding. The HTC was always freezing. The iPhone is great but graphics are not astounding. Apple has always appealed to my sense of logic. Windows escapes me. It doesn't make sense. I would like more control over the applications. I think we as a society have become pathetic that we need to be amused 24/7. I don't need to carry my music, my photos and see who I am talking to. (But I do) It's just bazaar how nosy we've become. I use this as a phone and use my computer as a computer. The iPhone never stays charged long enough to accomplish necessary tasks. It needs a much better battery. Otherwise, it's cool.
A wonderful addition to controlling communications in my busy life. I really don't have anything negative to say about it as long as you like toys. It works with everything I have including Bose isound system. My biggest fear is I drop it in the drink.
First time to have an apple device. Phone is great I don't think I could leave without it now.
I gave up after a month...I switched back to a 3G! I waited for the supposed Proximity Sensor "FIX" but it was just as useless as before. It is a very cool phone and the apps run great, but it might as well be an ipod touch because a full phone conversation is impossible! It wasn't the antennae bug that got me, it was the proximity sensor that wouldn't shut off the screen while I was on a call so I constantly put people on speaker, on hold, on mute, on Facetime, unintentionally called other people on my contacts etc.
Maybe my expectation for iPhone 4 was too high but I was not satisfied with the features of this phone. After a month of use, I traded my phone for an android Samsung Captivate. Compared to my old iPhone4 I prefer my Captivate phone and I am enjoying it!
Great phone. Haven't had a problem with dropped calls as described. Picture capabilities are great. HDR is awesome!
Great phone...easy to use...no problems with reception like those that were hyped up around its release. My only complaint is that you can NOT plug it into any computer with itunes to listen to music while you're traveling...it ONLY works with the computer you have it synced with. The ipod touch, for example, lets you put music on it at home and then licten to it on any computer if it is plugged in and has itunes. The iphone 4 won't do that!
Three days ago, after being mostly happy with my new iPhone, my 30 day return policy expired. Yesterday, the phone stopped charging. Today, it died. 6 days from today, I will get a new one. The only problem? I don't have a phone until then. If you rely on your phone for business, and need to keep it with you - DON'T BUY THIS PHONE.
Everything has worked great on the new phone. The screen is amazingly sharp and colorful. Apps optimized for the higher resolution look very very nice. I use my old 3G for some hobby stuff and you can definitely see the difference. You can also feel the difference -- the 4 is so much faster. I've had issues with the proximity sensor which the firmware update didn't correct. Maybe it's my greasy face, but I consistently press touchscreen buttons while on a call -- and I'm not holding the phone with my shoulder, either. The camera is very nice, but the flash leaves some things to be desired. My AT&T experience has remained relatively good and fairly priced. The voice control feature is very limited, especially when compared to Android-based phones. The nice thing is this: the hardware is terrific, but the software could use more polish/features. In time.
I have been an iPhone fan since the first Gen. This phone brings back the metal that i loved about the first Gen. faster, stronger, cleaner, Better all around.
I love the features on the Iphone 4 but using the phone is horrible! You have to sit perfectly still to talk or your face will hit the screen and either hang up the call or mute the call. It's very annoying!!!! I love everything about the phone but can't talk on it. I want to get a different phone. I had the Iphone 3Gs before and never had this problem so it's very disappointing!
I bought 2 iphone 4's they both have the antena problem ive own them for about 2 months and they both have crashed. And still need more servicing from the Apple store. I had the 3gs too it was a better phone then this on in alot of ways. If i go out of service the phone has to be reset to make the service come back on. The new cameras on the phone are great I shoot alot of mountain and wild animals pic. Sorry to say that the carrier that iphone uses is one of the worst ive used and the 3g is also one of the worst. So that make is phone less use full than most. If you havent invested in Apple yet you mite want to look at the Andriod instead. Sprint is cheaper and has 4g now with hot spot on the phone and many more opptions that apple does not.
This phone doesn't disappoint. Even when filled with 14+GB of data, it is still fast and very responsive. I've had the 16GB model for almost two months now, and have put it through the ringer. Somehow I can't manage to put it down for longer than 5 minutes at any given time. There's so much you can do with it if you take time and do some research. I use my iphone to control my home theater system, car stereo, personal computer and network router. Gone is the mouse, keyboard, and a handful of other remotes. This is one expensive multifunction replacement- but it works great! The best part about it is that there are numerous GPS apps to choose from in the app store. TomTom USA, Magellan RoadMate, and Navigon Mobile Navigator are the three best NAV apps for this iphone. Tom Clancy's HAWX, SplinterCell Conviction, GTA, NFS Shift/Underground and Rockband keep me preoccupied while I'm waiting for appointments. Game play is totally smooth and impressive with the internal gyro. Don't forget to protect your investment with an Otterbox Defender Series case. What about dropped calls? I haven't had one yet!
the phone is awsome, at&t is not. the 5x camera is great if you need a 8x on your phone go ahead but you wont get an ipod.
The phone drops a lot of calls and redials people and adds calls while I am on a call - which is frustrating
I went from the 3g to a HTC Evo. After a few days I didn't like it at all. So I went back!
Thi s I a fantastic phone!! Well worth the money!!
First i love the camera its a big change between the iphone 3g. The display is great The battery is also good compared to the 3g it could be better but its a smartphone i give apple their props.Its is really amazing device.
Quality is a major factor to the iPhones success; upgraded from iPhone 3 to 4; what a difference. Speed; multi tasking; and voice control plus the screen display is incredible, so vivid, so clear. I have not had the "death grip" issue (as of yet)...most important to me is ease of use... and this phone is very user friendly. AT&T: Need to offer lower priced phone insurance for this model.
I love my iPhone. I have always had an iPhone since they came out. All of the features and battery life gets better all of the time. Calls are dropped less. More fun. I want all of my family and friends to get this phone so I can video conference them. Love it.
I was hoping for a better keyboard. If you have nails (I'm a girl and I do!!!) It is difficult to type on. Don't see much difference between my old 3GS and this one.
I bought this phone for my wife. She had been using it non stop since she got it. I have the 3gs. Apps are great, fun to use and useful. The display on the iPhone 4 is simply amazing! The difference is immediately noticeable. Fonts are clear and photos look great. Camera is much better and HD video is nice. She also likes Facetime and uses it with a friend. The battery is better than the 3gs, but it's still a smart phone, which sucks the juice. The only complaint is that she is hanging up on people a lot. Could be the screen sensitivity or the way she is holding the phone, but her ear will press the hang up button quite a bit. She is getting used to it though, but she almost returned the phone because of it.
Got my iPhone 4 in yesterday.. And haven't put it down yet... The new Retina Display is amazingly beautiful.. Games run extremely smooth Switching between apps is lighting fast Call clarity has greatly improved from my old 3g as well Slick design! The camera takes great photos... And FACETIME! .. Face Time is an awesome feature found only on the 4...
When it comes to cell phones (and email), it is all about the network. Cool features and a slick interface serve no purpose when the network coverage is spotty at best. I live and work in Chicago - yet I frequently have calls dropped while sitting in my office, walking across the street to get lunch, or even in my back yard (when I can actually see multiple cell towers in the distance). Email coverage is no better. My email will not update about 1/2 the time I am in my office. I have also had network issues while travelling to Seattle, so it's not as though my problems are isolated to remote parts of the country - these problems are persistent in the most wired places in the world. Apple and AT&T need to get their acts together. The hype can only hold up for so long. If I had to do it over again, I would stick with Blackberry on the Verizon network.
Great phone, I love it. I have had Verizon for years and wanted the ipone so I switched to AT&T. The service has been great and the phone is easy to use. The customer service I received from Best Buy was great along with the knowledge of the phone and the plane I chose.
The Iphone 4 is just a great device. The camera and video are top notch. Ease of use is first rate. Touch screen is just right, not too sensitive or prone to errors and the clarity of screen in general is like looking at a HD tv even for not so perefect eyes and so much more clear than competion I've seen. Call reception is no problem in areas that have solid ATT service but where ATT service is lacking call quality drops a bit but thats ATT's fault not the 4's. GET A 4 YOU WON'T REGRET IT
It's Apple, it works all the time, and it does everything . In addition to all the fun I'm having researching and using apps, I love it for easy Skype calls for cheap global calls over the internet, and keeping my info on calendar and contacts synched with my MacBook wirelessly! It's amazing, simply
I am a blackberry fanatic and this is my first iPhone; however I am loving this phone it is great. There are certain things that I would like for example the customization of the SMS ringtones and the themes oh and the profile ringtones it's either vibrating or ringing and it is the same for all the contacts you cannot customize that either but other than that it is great
This is my first IPhone. I am overally very happy. Had a little trouble linking to a bluetooth headset, but eventually got it. speaker phone could be a little bit louder, but works fine. Just can't sit in on a table and still hear the person from several feet away. Battery life is good compared to older models from what I have learned from friends with the older 3g's, but seems to run down fast compared to my IPad.
Great phone! Really enjoy all the features and apps available. Do wish battery lasted longer, but overall great phone!
Great phone, it's easy to use. Not a fan of the keyboard, could be better if it had the keyboard like the samung or droid with swpye keys. Battery life is okay, I can usually go a whole day without charging my phone. Phone wise, I have not any problems with dropping calls. Apps are great and surfing the Internet is pretty cool. Also the camera is awesome!!!
The iPhone 4 is remarkable. The OS 4 is quick and downloads are fast. There isn't a product out there that can compare with the resolution of the screen. The clarity is amazing! The only issue, and it's clear I'm not alone in this, is the battery. Ridiculous for a product of this caliber to have battery issues.
This screen is the best I've seen. Easy to use an almost the same as my 3G with the software upgrade except with this phone you can multitask if that matters to you. My problem was the poor reception and dropping calls all the time. Also I don't like that they made it smaller and edgy it isn't as comforable as the 3G to talk on. I even got a nice case like I had for my 3g and it helped a little. My 3g still got better reception and dropped less calls and it wasn't that great. I can hold my KRZR next to it and have twice as many bars and it never drops calls. I tried the HTC Aria but it is sub par compared to the Verizon and Sprint Versions HTC makes. Also AT&T ruins it by blocking some apps as usual leave it to AT&T to make a decent phone bad. My friends Driod X is much better than my Iphone 4 and the new Droid 2 with the Android 2.2 is even better with a working flash player definaly check them out, Verizon is like AT&T with expensive plans though. I ended up getting a white EVO and have thee 2.2 Android OS and love it I miss the way some of the apps worked on the iphone like Redbox DVD app is better on apple. Overal I bought a car charger, stand like the original iphone came with and a spare batt. for $45 and couldn't be happier also I now pay $40 less a month and have unlimited everything. Houston is a 4G network so it makes this thing blazing fast compared to the Iphone and AT&T's 3G, BTW Verizon is also much faster at least on the Moto Droid X and 2.
I liked my g3 but I love my I 4 It works like I think.
i upgraded from a blackberry curve 8310 and i love this phone already!! my mom has the iphone 3g and i always would use hers or play with it. so i finally got my own and i havent seemed to have a problem with it yet. its really thin but not too thin. its perfect ! lol. im pretty sure ill be keeping this phone for the whole 2 year contract without breaking it due to carelessness.
hate that i have to buy a song from itunes, turn it into a ring tone, then buy it again??? i can barely hear the phone ring in my purse. of course the games and apps are a ton of fun and make the phone worthwhile. without these features the phone would suck just as a phone. might as well buy the ipod touch and get a real phone.
I like the shape better then the older one.I'm rough on phones so I put a cover on them right away to protect them not to dress them up. I haven't had any problems with reception on dropped calls with the phone. So far I haven't found anything not to like about it.Customer support from Best Buy has been excelant and their follow up calls and e-mails have been good too.
Incredible phone, Apple just continues set the pace. I am impressed with every aspect of this amazing device!!! I can't wait to see what they do next.
i love this phone got last week to replace my motorola droid!!!! i love it so much better!!!! screw verizon and there high price plans!!! AT&T has been just as good with service if not better in my area
This iPhone 4 is yet another "trend setting device" for the others to try to replicate. The display is nothing short of being "first class". I've owned the 3g model, and a couple of Droids and this phone blows them all out of the water. It's very fast, and regardless of all the negative attacks on the reception problem, I have to say after a month of using it, they're just plain wrong. I've not had one dropped call and the 3g network is much MUCH faster than any other carrier. I've tested it thorougly in several throughout Ohio. I would recommend a screen protector as I did scratch my display and not sure how that happened. Other than that, I'm very impressed with this phone and have nothing negative to say about it.
I finally upgraded from my old 3G after waiting a few weeks after the 4 came out. Antenna issue? All I have to say is that people need to let that go and have been beating it to death. The display is amazing, when they say that you can't see individual pixals, they aren't lying. The camera is great and the LED Flash is very helpful if you like to take a lot of night time shots. It is very fast compared to the 3G and has little to no lag. The battery life is MUCH better, and the battery percentage is a nice cool little feature. The design of the phone is great compared to the other ones, to me at least. I have no regrets. Buy this phone, and don't let someone turn you away from it because of the antenna issue. They're over-reacting.....a lot.
I was amazed by the iphone 3G,but apple has done it again best phone of its generation... Theres only one true smart phone and thats the Iphone..... The Droid, The Evo, Any htc phone iphone blows them away
I upgraded from the older iPhone mainly to have access to Face Time and I have to say that it is worth it. It has come in so handy and it's so much fun. I would say the only down side is that this phone appears to have greater screen sensitivity so it is easy to disconnect or suddenly hit mute accidentally. Sometimes the phone seems to have a life of its own and create a new note or something without my intervention. Oh well, I can put up with that.
The iPhone 4 has a great camera both for still shots and video that comes in handy at a spare of the moment. The gyroscope makes game play even more cool. The multitasking comes in handy when I'm out jogging and I can track my distance with one app and listen to Internet radio with another. Definate buy!
This thing is like carrying a small computer with you. I have had no problems with reception in the Twin Cities.
Reception needs some help with this iPhone 4. I have a bumber for it and it still doesn't help. The "Death Grip" problem lurks. I've had many dropped calls.
It took a dump. Phone got hot by itself. Got a new one. That was great till Ghost Armor activated the water sensor. Thanxs GA
Have difficulty with hanging up on people. I feel the controls are too sensitive.
All you hear about this phone on the news is the bad reception problem.. Personally I have not ran into this problem, nor has my sister who go one as well. This phone is fast, sleek, slim, and everything that I'm looking for in a phone.. I recommend this to current iPhone users and other users looking to upgrade to a great phone
I love how well the phone works but iTunes is a very buggy piece of software. If they can improve iTunes then this would be the perfect phone
It makes a great iPod touch, but if you need it to actually work like a phone, keep your old iphone and wait for Apple to fix (workaround) the design flaws. I'm not even addressing the antenna issue. While a genuine problem, and something that never should have made it to production, the coverage and impact is overblown as a case or bumper can easily "fix" the problem. The elephant in the room with this phone is the proximity sensor bug. Apple changed the hardware that properly detects when the phone is up to your face, and the hardware and new OS appears to have a difficult time in real world situations detecting when to shut the screen off. When it works properly, you never give a 2nd thought that you're using a device with a touch screen. But if you have one of the phones that are experiencing this you will find yourself accidentally muting, hanging up, pressing the keypad, or initiating face time. Unless using a headset, this can make the phone infuriating to use. Apple is attempting to fix through hardware, but if you're close to the end of the 30 day return window and have this problem, return the phone and wait for a fix, or the iphone 5 whichever comes 1st. My phone also had reception problems that AT&T could not resolve. At times, it would completely lose the network. AT&T thought it might have bad SIM.
Apple's display is awesome. Battery life is better and A4 processors is much better.
Yes, I can force the signal drop by holding the phone in a "death grip". Other than that, I'm enjoying the phone. Having waited until this model with iOS4 to switch to iphone, I've been happy with my choice so far. If you're looking for smartphone capabilities in a very simple, easy to use format, the iphone is probably for you.
I've had this phone since release day. Didn't know there was an antenna problem for over a week when someone told me about it . Never looked at the bars during a call holding the phone to my ear. I've dropped a total of one call in 30+ days. Any phone with any carrier will drop a call at some point. Everyone already knows about all the features of this phone , but I think the reception issue has been beat to death. I use this as primary phone for my business and if I couldn't make calls with it I would have returned it for something else. This is my first Iphone but I wouldn't hesitate to buy another. If you are looking for arguably the best smart phone on the market, give this one a try. If it doesn't work for you, you can always return it. But once you have used one I don't think you will.
To start with, it's a beautiful phone. The features in iOS 4 are awesome. If Apple manages to fix the proximity sensor issues, the phone would be perfect to me, the best I've held bar none. I know some of you are worried about the antenna issue, but here's the thing, I had an iPhone 3g before I got this one, and I could never make a call from home (due to bad service), with iPhone 4 although it shows a bar or two the call quality is amazing. Now I got a 3G Microcell from At&t and honestly, the antenna thing is not an issue at all.
Have had ip4 since then day came out. I do have proximity problems. I did not know about antenagate till later b/c I use a case. The battery is a lot better. Screen is amazing.
Best iphone yet. Screen resoultion is beautiful. Recording in HD video is awesome and easily uploads videos to youtube. Works great. No antenna issues at all. Sleek, nice to handle, feels good in the hand. All the apps runs smooth. Hasn't frozen up once. Internet pages load up super fast. I could go on and on. My wife also has one. Her phone works perfectly as well. Several of my friends have one as well and they all love it. Best phone on the market!
Terrible connections and loss of calls regularly - a waste of myoney. Sorry I took the plunge!!
Of course its nice.I bought it for my wife and she enjoys it.looks great feels expensive.
I was an early adopter on the original iPhone, bought it when it was released in 2007. So it was time for an upgrade. I am extremely pleased with the additional features that Apple included this time. And when I say a great portable computer, it is all of that and more.
I loved my 3G, I passed on an upgrade for the 3GS because well there was no compelling reason to do so. With this new entry from Apple comes the long awaited features many, many people have begged for. So I upgraded! I love the 5mp flash based camera and the multitasking makes it very easy to switch between apps. and or email or even text messages! Great job Apple! It is true about the reception issues or rather the "Deth Grip" and if you think this will be an issue for you then just go ahead and pass. I am often on speaker phone and dont really "grip" my phone in the way that it would cause me too have an issue with the phone.
This phone is so easy to use I can't believe it. Every thing you need to do is prompted. The interface is completly intuitive.
I have had the phone since launch and love it. I never dropped calls even without a case and I am in spotty coverage for my area. I did buy the black bumper and love the feel and look of it compared to no case. The display is amazing and the speed is a vast improvement over even the 3GS. I give my full recommendation for is phone and again state, don't let anteanna concerns keep you from this phone. It will blow you away.
I had my iPhone 4 for 2 weeks before I returned it. This was my 3rd iPhone. I've had the original iPhone, the 3G-S, and the iPhone 4. I had far less calling problems with my 3G-S. It's a shame I sold it to get the iPhone 4 or I'd still be using it now. The nicest thing about all the iPhones are their ease of use. Anyone can just pick one up and pretty quickly get a handle on how it works. Facetime is a crock. It only works on wifi and for the half dozen facetime calls I tried to make during my time with the phone, ALL of them froze/dropped the call at least once. Dropped calls were worst on this than ANY other phone I've ever had. That was the ultimate reason why I returned it. I need a nice smartPHONE... I've already got a nice iPod.
I own a phone store, we buy and sell over 80 different models of phones, have 500 in stock and I test everyone of them. the 3gs was not stellar for reception, but it is leaps and bounds above the iphone 4.0. Even with a case this phone drops calls about 40% more than the 3gs. My opinion? Keep the 3gs, or wait for Verizon to ship one.
I've owned 3 of the 4 models of iPhones and this is truly a superior product. I've head the EVO blows this thing away and to that I say, "great!". I'll still take the iPhone. Mostly because Im a Mac owner. I think all the hype about the antenna and the glass on the front & back is a bit silly. It's not perfect. Apple isn't perfect. Silly design flaw? Maybe. Most all of us buy cases for our phones anyway so, problem solved. The iOs4 is another fantastic leap forward for the iPhone and finally, the thing that has blown all my friends away; the screen. Quite a few folks I have spoken with who were iPhone owners yet reluctant to upgrade to 4, had their minds changed once I showed them the screen. All in all I am so pleased every time I use this phone and highly advise everyone to go and check one out if you haven't already.
I love my Iphone, unlike other people I have not encountered any problems!
Upgraded from 3G. This is a big difference in speed. Applications open quickly. I haven't had a dropped call yet which I would have many on my 3G, and I'm not using da bumper cuz I'm not a fan of cases.
Due to the iphone having drop calls I am very unhappy with the service. Especially since I left one provider thinking that at and t service was great. I would not recommen the phone to anyone.
I haven't had any issues with dropped calls, however, my biggest complaint is that the screen is so flat that when I'm on the phone, my cheek will press the hold or mute buttons by accident & the person on the other line thinks they lost the call. If I switch the keypad to the numbers side, my cheek presses the numbers, then there's lots of tone sounds throughout the phone call. I guess the solutions would be using the headset or speaker feature. Also, the battery is supposed to be 40% more but it uses more power so therefore, it's the same. I can only get to the end of each day before the battery drains completely.
I am completely in love with this phone. I've not had a single dropped call yet. I've spent hours upon hours watching videos and it still took over three days of near constant use to drain the battery. Look no further. The ultimate all in one device is here!
I had the 3GS and it was great and this iPhone 4 is even better! Apple makes the best products and I buy them at Best Buy so I can get the service plans, protection, and reward zone points.
This phone loses reception when you hold it and drops calls like crazy. This is my first I phone and not too happy to be honest
iPhone 4 has an antenna issue and various firmware bugs (e.g. proximity sensor)! Facetime is a really cool feature. Apple might consider to redesign the antenna and solve firmware issue ASAP.
Have always been an iphone fan and this is definitely the latest and greatest. Antenna is not an issue. Definitely an improvement in every way: camera, video, screen, look and feel, facetime, battery.
I have been an iPhone user since the beginning, in 2007. This is by far the best iPhone that Apple has come out with. Nonetheless, If you are like me and upgraded from a previous version then the transition isn't very glamorous. It still does 100% of what your 3GS did but with some hardware improvements. The value of this item, considering all it does, is excellent with the gracious subsidy by At&t. The features are abundant, such as Facetime, 720p front camera video recording, multi-tasking, and many more. The ease of use is by far my favorite part about this phone. Everything on this phone runs seamlessly and transitions from one area to the next smoothly. The Safari internet is by far the best mobile internet browser anyone could ask for. The battery life on this new version is still not the best but is improved over past versions. Although, with all the functions that it has, it would be quite hard to preserve the battery on such a small device. The antenna issue is a bit of a setback. Apple will most likely quietly fix this in manufacturing of the phone. Apple has yet done it again with a beautiful and verb full phone. Also, everyone should be thankful for Android phones. They're getting better every time and I thank Google for bringing competition so innovation can flourish for the consumer.
This is my first Iphone coming from my last Windows 6.0 and 6.5 phones. So far I'm very pleased with the product and interface. I have been a PC person all my life - I didn't enjoy being told what I could and couldn't for my computing needs. That's what I associated with Apple - lack of options. I will probably never own a Mac but as far as what I need on a phone I think this simplifies everything to what I needed. The OS is very fast, camera is great, video is impressive. Overall I would recommend this phone over any Windows phone. If you are with AT&T it's probably the best phone choice as well. If not the new Droid phones (X and Evo) are fantastic choices as well. On the flip side the antenna issues are true so buy a case...
What an upgrade! The new iPhone is so user friendly with features I use daily to keep me in touch, organized, and informed. I love FaceTime!
I haven't had any experience with the death grip problem, but I bought a case when I got the phone like most people do. If a phone costs $600 to replace not having a case seems crazy to me anyway. So my rating is based on features and functionality alone, not considering a reception problem I haven't experienced. AT&T service is good in my city. So that isn't a problem either, but if I lived in one of the notoriously problematic metro areas then that would be a different story.
I love my iPhone 4, not really any reception problems for me. Overall it's just a great phone.
This phone does so many things. I hate jumping on bandwagons but there's nothing better for my needs. I don't live in a city with a maxed out network so my quality of service with AT&T is high. I'm a tech geek and everything about Android excites me but the everyday usefulness and the mountains of free, quality time wasters makes me forget about Android phones. If you're waiting for one to hit Verizon, stop. It won't happen until 2012. All of the speculation is silly considering the high cost of breaching the contract for both AT&T and Apple.
Iphone 4 is the best iphone since the 3G came out. Faster, better screen, sound is better, more memory, and longer battery life all make this phone the best on the market. I would have liked a bigger screen but that is definitely not a deal breaker. I also don't have a problem with the antenna.
Never had any reception issues with the antenna; the "death grip" only happens when holding it tightly and unnaturally to make an effort to make signal drop. I've actually found it to have BETER reception than my iPhone 3G or Blackberry Curve. Video quality is STUNNING, as is camera quality in bright light. Low light performance is still excellent, as are low light photos taken with flash. They will be somewhat "grainier" or "washed-out" in each situation, but compared to the cameras on other smart phones, this one performs noticeably better. Don't be fooled by megapixels - this camera is better. It took me a few weeks to really get over how fast it is. Everything is snappy with near-instant response to any commands. Screen is absolutely gorgeous, with everything you look at looking like a laser-printed sticker than an LCD. Wireless N is a great step up - can get signal approx. 10x further from my house than I did with G Overall, you can NOT go wrong with this! If you're looking for a smartphone and AT&T's coverage is good where you are, you won't regret it! I even know a few people who prefer Verizon's service but say the iPhone is worth it.
Great platform, unfortunately the issues with reception ruin all of them.
I used to be a verizon customer before this, and i was very nervous about switiching from at&t to verizon just for the iphone, but it truly was a great choice. The display is truly one of a kind, and NO PHONE could match it. The camera is very nice, and so is the video shooting ability. Facetime is pretty good, though not quite the hype it was made to be. Using the phone is a little complicated to learn about at first, but you learn quickly. There are SO many fun apps to use, most of which are reasonably priced or FREE. Call quality is ok, its a little soft for some people, but i find it ok. The battery life is outstanding, it lasts like 10 hours for me(doing a variety of things, calling, texting, surfing the web, listening to music, and playing with apps). Overall it is one amazing phone.
As a former 3GS owner, I have to say it's an upgrade, but only slightly. The camera is better, the front facing camera is fun but I don't think I'll ever really use it. Other than that, there's not much I do more with the iPhone4 phone than I did with the 3GS. Actually there are some big steps backwards with this phone. I thought I was having major antenna issues because my calls kept abruptly ending. It turns out it's the proximity sensor. The sensor doesn't work well and I consistently turn my phone off with my face because the touchscreen doesn't turn off when I'm talking. To me this is even bigger than that whole antenna-gate issue. Speaking of the antenna, I'm not happy with Steve Jobs' "FIX" to this whole antenna issue. An ugly rubber boot around my beautiful phone is NOT a long term solution. I was hoping for a recall to fix the antenna and proximity sensor. I was in love with my phone when I first got it, but I'm getting more and more frustrated and disappointed as time goes by. I kind've wish I just stuck with my 3GS. Oooo well...what are you gonna do?
Android fanboys will not like this review whatsoever. I love the iPhone 4. It's a superb phone and in my opinion, surpasses any other phone right now on the market. Let me point out right now, if you are skeptical about this phone because of the reported antenna issues, I do not have an issue at all. Plus, Apple has reported that only 0.55% of all users with their AppleCare plan have called in to report an antenna issue. It's all overblown. There's absolutely no learning curve to the iPhone 4 at all. You don't even need to read the instruction booklet. You turn it on and you automatically know what to do. If you've previously owned an iPhone, even better. The "retina" display is the sharpest display ever and it's just beautiful. I can't see any pixels at all, and it looks like a magazine page honestly. It has an incredible feature set. The camera is the best camera I've ever used on a smartphone and HD video recording tops that along with iMovie for iPhone to create a movie straight from the phone. It's a very zippy phone and you shouldn't have any problems with multitasking or high usage. I haven't gotten to trying out FaceTime yet, but I've heard nothing but terrific things about it, except for the fact that it only runs WiFi but I think that's a good thing because over 3G the quality might degrade. I do wish it had a bit more widget support, WiFi hotspot capabilities, and I sort of have a pet peeve about videos being in the Photos app. Those are all personal preference, though. The phone is simply stunning and at the $199 price point it's even better. The build quality is great as well. Some people have worries about the glass being an issue to break when dropped, but chances are that if you are buying an iPhone, you are very careful anyway. All phones need a case so if you tend to be clumsy, get one. The glass is supposed to be very strong though. As for battery life, it's way above the industry standard. It's gotten to the point where you'd just expect this type of terrific battery life to be in any smartphone. Bottom line, if you are in the market for a new smartphone, get this phone. It's as simple as that.
I got my iPhone 4 5 days ago, and I've had a lot of time to use it. I absolutely love it! The screen is incredible! The 5 megapixel camera takes amazing pictures, the video editing feature is great too if you take a lot of videos. The iOS4 software is also excellent. The multitasking feature is great, as well as the folders and iBooks features. FaceTime is excellent as well, but it is a bit restrictive. It would be great if you could have a video chat with someone on skype, ichat, etc. Which I'm sure will be coming in the future! I have never dropped a call, and the so-called antennae problems haven't affected me at all (as well as 95% of iPhone 4 users). The quality of the materials used in this device are phenomenal! It's extremely durable. I would recommend this to anyone who wants THE BEST smartphone at a great price!
We are long-time VZ customers who absolutely love the coverage/service we get on our VZ phones in our area... The problem is VZ does not have the iPhone 4. That being said, my wife was in need of phone and she had been wanting the iPhone for a while. We decided to give it a try and see how she liked it. As for the phone, it it truly incredible... a fantastic piece of equipment, which incorporates an MP3 Player, Movie Player, Camera, Video Camera, GPS, Netbook and even a Phone into one beautifully designed piece of hardware. It is extremely easy to use and my wife loves everything about the device. There have been numerous claims about the antenna/reception issue but in the 2 weeks we have had the phone, we have not experienced this problem, even when trying to do so. The only negative thing I can say, is that AT&T's service does not even come close to VZ... we've compared reception for my wife's iPhone and my BB Storm as we travel our normal routes each day/week and VZ wins everywhere, hands down. I so wish Apple and VZ would work out a deal soon... iPhone + Verizon = lots of happy customers. Now comes the hard part, deciding whether to keep the iPhone with avg service or take it back and wait until it is released on VZ... eventually... I pray.
Got my iphone 4 and I have to say I was fairly disipointed. There isn't enough new featuers that make me want this more than my 3gs. It's faster, HD display and better camera, but that's where the enhancemnets stop. A front facing camera, video chat (which is only good over Wi-Fi), slimmer design doens't make it worth 199.99. The problems that come with it are not a keeper to me etheir which include the grip of death, yellow displays, camera yellowing and shattering problems. I would recommned stay away from Apples first attempt at a new iphone design and wait for a newer model down the road.
Just received my iPHONE 4 yesterday. THE PROBLEM so many people are locking in on is the RECEPTION ... or lack of it. Seems most are blaming AT&T for this, and AT&T is NOT at fault here (I've had AT&T for my iPHONE 3 GS, and many other phones before it, never a problem). Consumer Reports have nailed the problem to THE ANTENNA. Yup, Apple screwed up on this design. Can they fix it via a "software patch?" Who knows? That "patch" has not been issued. There IS a way to instantly solve the problem (yes, I immediately had those bars dropping to zero, too): get the BELKIN GRIP VU case. It's clear, wraps over the back but, more important, wraps over that faulty antenna zone on the lower left of the iPHONE, preventing your hand from making contact. Problem solved! Give it a shot, and keep the iPHONE :-)
For this I'm only going talk specifically about the phone & not about all the great features on iOS4. That is something else & also makes the phone even better. For starters, the screen is fantastic! It blows all others (I haven't seen a Galaxy S yet) out of the water. The speed of the phone noticeable even when compared to the 3Gs. The adding of 512 memory was a pleasant surprise. The camera really makes all others moot unless you need zoom. The LED flash is more than adequate & it takes great low light pictures. The phone feels great & well made. I didn't like the glass back until I installed invisible shield, now I think it great. The high speed upload on this phone allows over 1mbps almost always in the Boston area. Now for the negatives. Well AT&T for starters. No AVRCP, weak notification system and no notification light.
I am a huge iphone fan. I have had the 3gs for a while now and have had the iphone4 for about 5 days. Its nice don't get me wrong and if you don't have an iphone then You will love it, but honestly the things they changed don't really mean anything to me. The camera is better but I didn't mind the other camera, its a little faster but the 3g isn't really slow, and the buttons are easier to hit but I didn't have trouble with the other ones. I keep it for a week but if I can live without it I'll send it back and keep my 3GS and my 200 bucks. If you want a great iphone that'll do it all cheap get the 8gig 3GS for $99.00 You'll still be the envy of your friends and be money ahead!
I have had the phone for about a week now and I can speak from plenty of experience that this is the best Iphone yet! Over the last two years or so I have owned Blackberry, Android and Windows Mobile devices - I have also had previous Iphone versions (the original Iphone and the Iphone 3G). The new "retina display" lives up to the hype by providing a viewing surface that simply has not been seen before, colors are crisp and clean, text is smooth and frankly you cannot see pixelation anywhere. Iphone 4 comes loaded with the A4 processing chip (the same one in the Ipad) and the speed differences are noticible right away. Apps load immediately, I have not noticed even one second of lag even when I have 10+ apps running at the same time...which brings me to multitasking... Multitasking - is an absolute killer feature on the Iphone 4, quickly switch from one app to another in such a way that you arent even thinking about it. Get an email while texting another friend? Just go from mail to messaging with a quick double tap of the home button. Listen to music as you browse the web or as you check sports scores. Iphone 4 offers two cameras a 5megapixel camera that also shoots 720P HD video, then a VGA front facing camera which alows owners to do "Face Time " calls with other Iphone 4 owners over a WiFi connection. Though facetime only works over WiFi and with other Iphone 4's for now the software is "open source" and should only grow in popularity over time. Battery life is also improved with Iphone 4, I can easily get through a full day even with pretty decent usage levels.
I've had every generation of iPhone and apple has really hit it out of the park with this one. From the speed of the possessor to the anti-scratch front and back this phone lacks little. Have not had dropped calls or much loss of signal as others say. I'm a big fan of the apple iphone and i can't wait to see what comes out next.
This a great device but comes way short as use as a phone. Several dropped calls and fails. i FINALLY GAVE UP
I cannot compair this to the Evo or Droid because I have never used those before. All I can share is my experience with this phone. I upgraded from from a 3g. I Immediatly notice how much faster it was, way faster. The Hi-res screen is amazing. Very clear, bright and the colors look great. The camera takes nice clear pictures, even in low light, the video works well too. The voice dialing and iPd voice control is something that should have been on the earlier models IMO, but it is nice to have them now, and it works very well. Face time video calling is a cool feature as well. It works suprisingly well with no noticible video lag. I cant really think of much this phone doesnt have/do that I wish it would. In this 4th generation, it is a very sleek, quick, well polished phone that can entertain, work and play just as hard as you do. Sure, you can get a higher res camera on other phones. But how much do you need, You probably wouldnt rely on your phone to take wedding photos or anything. Maybe there are "faster" phones with all kinds of this and that and numbers on a page. But when it comes down to it., does your phone fit your needs and how well it does it that matters. The rest is just words/numbers. This new iPhone does everything I need and more and with great speed and ease. That makes it a 5 star phone in my book. As far as AT&T goes, at least here in Western WA, I have had very little trouble with them in the 6 years I have been with them.
This is my first iPhone and I am absolutely blown away. Everyone knows the feature list, and every single thing about this phone is awesome. I can't get over how easy it is for me to type on this phone. It thought there would be a learning curve coming from a blackberry but within an hour I was actually typing faster than usual! I've had no issues with reception either. My local BestBuy store and BestBuy community connector were fantastic throughout the preorder process as well. Nice job Apple and BestBuy!
I have owned every version of the iPhone since it came out and this is truly the best version yet. I thought the phone could not get any better but I was clearly mistaken. When I watched the keynote presentation by Steve Jobs and how he kept bragging about this new "retina display", I didn't think much of it. But when I got the device in my hand the first time, i could not believe the difference. It takes some getting used to. The physical look of the phone is nothing short of breath taking. It really feels like a nice luxury watch in your hand. I love the heft of it and honestly never liked how the 3g and 3gs felt with that plastic back on them. This is really a great upgrade. Initially, I thought that the "killer" app, FaceTime, was going to be a gimmick and that it probably would not work well. It actually works UNBELIEVABLY well. The quality of picture and sound is amazing. Audio and video are in perfect synch and there is no choppiness during transmission. Unlike a computer web chat, you can move around and show your surroundings and the cameras capture excellent video in low light. The ability to switch between front and back cameras is seamless and fun. Multitasking works well and is well implemented, although it does take some time to get used to not pressing the home button ONCE and opening another app. But time will fix that muscle memory. Bluetooth is better because you can now adjust the volume with the handset itself. And evidently you should be able to skip tracks and whatnot as well. The speaker on this phone is greatly improved. It is nice and loud now. For the people that complain about dropped calls: It's not the iPhone's fault here. If you do get dropped calls, then complain about it on an att forum. I personally have gotten very few dropped calls in the 3 years I have been with att. I don't understand what people are talking about. For the people who compare it to the Android phones: Go get an android phone if you need those features. The features of all iPhones are always published before release, so why buy one if you didn't like the features in the first place? Go buy an Android phone if that's what you want, but holy cow, enough with the comparison. I believe people buy an iphone for the same reason people buy a BMW or a Mercedes......for the experience. Apple delivers a very polished product that makes it fun to use and is very addictive. Overall, I love this new phone. I am glad Apple went back to glass and metal and ditched the plastic. It's fast, powerful, feature packed and most of all...........fun to use! I highly recommend it to all who are thinking of purchasing it.
This is such an impressive device!! The clarity is just amazing. I took a video of my kids and played it back on my 46" Samsung 1080P TV and it blew my mind. The multitasking was much needed and works very well. The speed is unreal. I don't know why people are complaining about this phone. I upgraded from an 8gb 3G. I picked my 16GB up on launch day at the Apple Store June 24th. I have had no problems with reception or dropped calls. If you don't like Apple products, buy something else. Keep up the good job Apple and AT&T!
This new iphone is has better features than the old version, but it still lacks the performance and some capabilities that the android phones have. The biggest disappointment is that they are still with AT&T. The service is horrible. They added a new antenna along the outerwall of the phone, but you still drop calls like crazy. Don't waste your money and don't believe the hype. I also bought the Evo 4G phone on Sprint and this phone has it all including the dual cameras (one is 8 megapixels, iphone is 5 megapixels) and a fast processor.
The phone itself is fantastic. A huge upgrade over the 3G. The display is amazing and the camera takes great pictures, Multitasking is also a great feature. I picked up this phone on launch day, via pre order. Best Buy called me at 8:55 pm the night before to schedule a 6:30 pm appt. I came to Best Buy early (6 pm) and they were able to help me right away. This was the quickest and simplest process I had for getting a new phone. Best Buy Mobile customer service is great.
I've only had it for a day but I'm totally in love with this phone. I upgraded from the 3G and the difference is night and day. The phone is slightly heavier and much smaller than the previous models. The iPhone 4 is fast and loads apps and wedpages quickly. The camera takes great pictures and the flash is a much welcomed addition. The best part is the retina display; the icons and text are crisp and look as they would on an HD TV. The best addition by far is Face Time. I was able to talk to a friend on the other side of the country in real time, too bad its only available on WiFi, AT&T needs to hurry up and upgrade to a 4G network. I can't wait till every phone has this feature, its truly the wave of the future.
This phone is terrible!!! No reception when holding the phone!!! I have this phone and an Evo and the evo blows it out of the water in every way imaginable!!! The only good thing about this phone is the apps which you could get on an ipod touch.
I love the new iphone 4. I bought one for me and my girlfriend ( her first iphone ) & we both are very happy. It is twice as fast, love the front facing camera and the display is unbelievable!
I wanted to share with everyone that I believe that this is the most revolutionary phone on the market. The battery life is amazing! VIDEO CHAT, this potentially is the best feature I have found yet with the phone. Its amazing. Its extremly easy to use and the functionality is great. Thanks Apple for great execution on this. SCREEN RESOLUTION, the resolution is amazing. Brighter and crisper! SPEED, Its so much faster. Everythign loads faster. THE NEW OS, multitasking, folders, one folder to check multiple email accounts. This phone is a must have.
I've only had my iPhone 4 for about an hour and this is an amazing device and I will recommend this to everyone I know. The camera is clear (front and back), the retina display is gorgeous, and the overall speed has improved amazingly.
Bought it as gift and it look awesome. Seem to have better quality than other.
I've used some lighter pens in the past, but this has a nice balance to it. This pen has a little weight to it. Built in pen is also cool. Beautiful design, metal, not some cheap plastic. Thanks!
The color was right as shown, the case fits, but the hole is not properly aligned on the side of the case for the silent mode
If you are anywhere from a little rough to heavily rough on your phone, this is a MUST have case. The Best part is that it does NOT make your phone too bulky as other durable cases do.
You can barely hear the person on the other line when on a call. Speaker sound is horrible unless you open the charging port cover. Keyboard buttons on the bottom of the screen are difficult to hit. 2 days after buying this case the rubber started to come off the case. Screen protector doesn't attach to the phone screen very well.
it is very protective and i think anyone who goes near water alot or drops their phone frequently should get a case as good as this one.
While I do prefer this case over the Otterbox because it doesn't have that silicon edge, Lifeproof has its own challenges. The clear screen over the phone face feels cheep and has two scratches already. Air remains trapped between the phone and case which interferes with the ability to naturally and easily touch the screen. And I hate that I have to use the jack adapter to plug my ear buds. And something about using the adapter results in my iPhone not recognizing that I've removed the adapter, so I have to do a hard power down and restart the phone to hear sounds without the ear buds. Bottomline, I wish I had my money back.
Great functionality with a little difficulty connecting to the charger, especially third party products.
My husband uses this case on his phone around the farm. His phone needs a lot of protection and this does the trick. But, he does complain about how heavy and awkward it is.
Have had some hot days this summer that created condensation in my otter box defender when kept in a pocket on a job site so I bought this. The unit is lighter and smaller than the otterbox, but it sticks out farther on the belt clip. When in a pocket, Siri wakes up all the time, meaning the button is getting pressed more easily than with the otter box. The security feature on the belt clip makes me feel better about the unit not falling when in hazardous height areas, but I do miss a few calls due to the lock simply slowing me down. The headset dongle must be unscrewed / removed to make phone calls when a headset is not connected, i understand it is part of the waterproof feature, I just wish there was a more elegant solution that did not require a minute or two of unscrewing and putting in a port plug. This port keeps it waterproof in my sink testing, I just would like to see an improvement primarily because there is no where to store the mini stereo dongle when not in use, even with the belt clip or armband. The speaker phone is barely useable when compared with the otter box defender (which is not waterproof). I was also able to use other accessories with the otter box defender (Magellan GPS kit or charging cradles), they are simply not an option with this case. The integrated screen protector has great touch/feel but causes the phone to be unreadable in bright sun / glare conditions. Overall this is a high quality case with waterproof features, the drawbacks may be part of making it waterproof today, but I hope future generations of product from this vendor will continue to evolve as the technology allows.
I use to have an Otterbox Defender case on my iPhone but I decided to look for something more slim without sacrificing the durability that the Otterbox has. With the Lifeproof case, not only is it durable but it is also waterproof! I really like the looks of it and it is so much more slim than the Otterbox Defender case. The only drawback I can think of for this case is that you have to use a attachment for the headphone jack since most headphones will not fit through the opening in the case, but overall this is a great case!
I bought this to replace my OtterBox Defender, which is really bulky. This is thinner, but the opening to access the hole on the bottom is too small. You can only use the Apple cord--not Griffin or Belkin or anything else. That's a royal pain. Now I'm finding that the touch screen cover isn't letting me access easily. So my verdict is not worth the money.
My children have iphones with different covers that they are not happy with. I bought this one not just on looks but for the protection. So far I have been pleased with it. I do see a small amount of moisture between the cover and the screen. Hopefully, that will not be a problem in the future. It is hard to tell if it has a good seal or not.
I personally have the black one and my wife loves the blue. However the bottom lath on this one is too loose so we will return it or switch it out.
For those that have the dropsies or are less than careful around liquids this is the case for you.
My problem with the case is that you have to use the USB cable that came with the phone. Also to use the headphones/AUX cord, you have to use the adaptor. Its ok for occasional use, but if ou use the IPOD feature, it becomes a pain.
If you or someone in your family spills coffee or pops a lot this is the case for them!
My only issue with the case is, older ipod cord to fit into the charge port.
I love to go fishing, canoeing, swimming, and just playing in the water with my kids. I can have my music on or check sports on the internet or throw my phone and let my kids chase after it to see who can get it first. It floats and I don't have to worry about it sinking.
What's the point in having a waterproof case if your phone winds up in the bottom of the lake? This was a great idea, and I used mine all summer long. I used it in Destin, and it was a constant attention grabber! I love lifeproof and have all of my apple products in one to date! The life-jacket is definitely an excellent product!
Easy to snap in your phone and go . My only problems are that it slips a bit when you sweat and when you tighten it, it pinches your arm
The strap works great. Very comfortable. It's easy to use, the phone can be popped in and popped out easily. The strap needs to be made in different sizes though. Make sure you read the instructions and have a good idea how big your arm is. I tried to place it on my forearm but that didn't work very well. The strap is not stitched together so after trying to make it fit on my arm while running or working out for less than a month, it came undone. I did take it back and had it exchanged but I'll probably end up giving it to my wife when I get her a new lifeproof case this week.
Read all the negative comments and still bought it, and glad I did. It is the best armband for my phone. I can only use it on my right arm for some reason, cause if I use it on my left it pinches my skin a bit. Other than that I would recommend it to everyone who wants to listen to music and go running. You must have the Lifeproof case in order to use this, just in case you didn't know.
Great casefor running and other sports but if you have an arm larger that 15.5 inches then you cannot use the arm band. It is not good if you spend $80 on the case and then another $40 on teh arm band just to findout it doesn't fit. I also bought the belt clip and use it to run for now.
As a runner and bicyclist, is it great to use the same armband for both sports. I don't have remove the phone from its case to put into the armband. Nor did i have to buy a separate holder for the bike. The phone locking mechanism into the armband is peace of mind while riding. I only with the arm band strap was longer. I had to use an extra piece of Velcro so it would fit my arm.
Given the bulk of the Lifeproof case this is really my only option for an arm band, unfortunately. According to the lifeproof web site it fits arms up to 15+ inches. I may have big arms but they're not bigger than 15 inches. When I put it on I have to push my sleeve up and strap it around my bare arm which gets uncomfortable after a while plus there's the dork factor of having one sleeve pushed up higher than the other. Another issue I have with the case is inserting the headphones is a pain once the phone is in the case. What I do is put the phone connector thorugh the top of the case, plug it into the iPhone and then put the iPhone into the case. I'm going to see if I can figure out a way to make an extension which I don't think is going to be an easy task so odds are I'll end up selling it and the iPhone case on Craigslist and try some other solution. Before you buy try it on to make sure you don't have fit problems like I'm having.
Great cover for Iphone. Shows your Team Spirit! Fits snugly and does not obstruct usage.
This cover is made poorly and doesn't properly align with iPhone controls. You can't switch the phone to vibrate because of the imperfection. What a disappointment. You had to know the covers were faulty.
Figuring that Skullcandy would have better QA, I bought this over an ebay case. It feels and looks great, but it covers a button! I mean come on, wouldn't you make something that actually fit?
I've been using a Gopro for water shots, but the video is dark and grainy if you are not in full sunlight. The Optrix housing takes superior video in even overcast days. Now that the iphone5 is out, I hope I can buy a used 4s as a dedicated camera.
We were planning a lot of outdoor activities this summer and I wanted a way to use the video option on my iPhone. I could have bought a GoPro, but that's just another device to carry. I bought the Optrix as soon as it was available and have taken it down rivers, in and out of the ocean and strapped to the handlebars of our wave runner. The footage has been killer and I never felt like my phone was in jeopardy.
I love my new Otter Box for my I-Phone. It's a great overall case which protects the entire phone. It has a cool design on it. It is very durable, yet still feminine.
This is a great accessory. It is stylish and gives the IPhone 4S a bit of splash. I purchased this for my husband and he loved the design on the back. It has helped protect it from scratches and small bumps and drops. While he carries it to work, he doesn't pull it out to use often but when he does, he gets compliments.
This is a good product. It is great for people who are hard on their phones; however, it weighs the phone down.
I work in the petro-chemical service industry and I am very hard on my iPhone. It's been dropped at lest 20 ft and has fallen on very hot surfaces and has protected my phone perfectly. I can take the phone out of the case and there is not a scratch on it.
Good except for battery. Camera is good. Connections are good.
The features and picture quality are great but call quality is poor. I need to constantly repeat myself when I am talking to someone. It is way too easy to call people in error with a touch screen. I guess my expectations were too high for smart phones. I was disappointed when I could not use SIRI to find I-tunes songs or apps.
Best phone yet from Apple. Bigger screen makes for easier use. Apps continue to be great. Addition of 4G service greatly increases data responsiveness. Storage more than adequate for my needs. Facebook integration is nice, but the fact that it changes how names are listed in Contacts is a little bit of an issue. Native support within iOS for group email would be very beneficial. It exists via smart groups in Address Book on Mac OS X. Also, it would be nice if I could get Siri integration with my Ford Sync handsfree system without having to push the button on the phone; possible solution would be to have Siri accessible from the top power button somehow.
Lighter and faster than iphone4. Not dramatically different from previous version though.
Great phone, Like the new screen size. Would of been happier if it was a little bit bigger, but it is good enough and the battery capacity so far has been great. I like the style of the new design, but durability of new casing is a little bit questionable. I would highly recommend purchasing a protective case. Nothing really ground breaking on this model, but it is a very solid phone.
I have no problems with the battery if I manage location settings and wifi, I get LTE in town 3G at home, and 4G LTE in the city. I use the phone for everything, its an amazing machine for music, photos, and am learning to make and encourage video calls via Skype and Face Time. I experience data connectivity if I connect to wifi at home where I spend a lot of time working. I bought this phone outright to utilize Verizon unlimited data, its great with iTunes and Spotify Pro. Siri is great, no issues with iMaps, google maps on the web, or google earth app. Upload photos to web apps with photo bucket or iCloud, which is great keeping my calendars notes and photos synced and backed up.
Very fast - keeps up with my searches and switching between apps etc Wish Verizon would add the capability to talk and surf the web A bit pricey in comparison to some of the new Samsung phone specs
Great quality and easy to use, also works great with My other Apple products.
The iPhone 5 is great and all for the average businessman or high-end job holder, but my biggest worry is the 4G-LTE. It may be RIDICULOUSLY fast right now, but that's because not too many people are using it; give it a year or so, and the 4G-LTE hype will die down and carriers will soon have to make a 5G network for web users, and by the time that does happen, an iPhone 5S will probably be out by then too.... the only reason why I bought this phone was because of the fabled 4G-LTE, but the more that I think about it, the more I realize that the 4G-LTE is just going to become like its predecessor, the 3G network.
I love this phone. My prior phone was am HTC Evo 4G with an extra battery. The difference in weight between my old phone and this iPhone is striking and a little bit unsettling. Now a warning for Sprint customers: there was some trouble with the 3G data in the beginning. After almost four weeks of frustration, Apple sent out an update via Restore and the Sprint directed me to erase all data and re-activate. Things seem better now, but be advised.
I got the iPhone the first day it dropped. I haven't been able to put it down. I love how it communicates between my MacBook Pro & my iPad2. Highly recommend this phone! No other phone comes even close to the iPhone.
I am familiar with phones that use the Android system and phones that use IOS. After leaving Android I made the switch to the Iphone 4s (purely for convenience because it seemed to merge my Ipod touch with a phone so I only needed to carry one device instead of two). The iphone 4s was my first iphone and I was very happy with it. I like the thin lightweight body of the Iphone 5 but I traded my iphone 4s in for the Iphone 5 mainly becuase of the larger screen. I have had excellent call quality and everything has worked smoothly as it did on my previous iphone. The phone's battery life has been as good or better than the Iphone 4s (I made it 26 hours without a charge; used it as a phone, music player, surfed the internet and checked facebook from time to time). If you are thinking about getting an Iphone 5 I highly recommend it. In my opinion other than screen size you won't notice a huge difference in the iphone 4s vs the Iphone 5, but I sold my iphone 4s for almost the cost of the new Iphone 5 upgrade price so for me it was worth the trade. I opted for 64g because my previous phone was 64g as well, I had already surpassed the 16g capacity but had not used 32gs, but I figure with a 2 year contract and app sizes getting larger not to mention the size of pictures and videoes now that they are HD, and the lack of expandable memory, I decided to go with the larger one. But even though my Android phone boasted expandable sd memory, only certain apps would go there, and there was only aproximately 1g worth of space on the phone for apps that would not go to the external memory. So a finite amount of space effects users of both systems I suppose. The bad if any so far, would be the price of the phone, for example, $200 difference in the 16g and the 64g phone when most 48gs of flashdrive space do not cost $200. I bought my phone at the Lexington, Ky store on Nicholasville, Rd and Dustin/salesman was very knowledgable and helpful in doing my upgrade.
Best phone I've ever owned. Not too big like other phones.
Great phone, significantly faster than previous models, everything you need/want. Very easy to use. Best phone to date.
For the price, battery issues should have been resolved before release, Software fixes after purchasing is not acceptable. Too top heavy to use one handed for its size. I returned it and am going with another phone for less price, but more self setting capabilities.
This is my first IPhone and I love it. Siri works great. Facetime is awesome and works well on a 3G network. Cloud synching works very well. The only knock I have is the battery life but it's still better than the EVO I used to have.
I have used an Android phone for the last couple of years. EVO 4G. While overall it was a great phone to begin with, over time it got worse and worse. I have only had this phone for a week and a half, but so far I love it. All the gripes I read online about it seem to be minimal in my eyes or people that are just too picky about certain things. The phone works and works well. I had an ipod touch, so everything I purchased or downloaded for that seamlessly transferred via the icloud to the iphone. I waited for things to download while I synced it and charged it for the first time and everything was there. It actually started downloading my apps and everything the minute I signed into my apple account. I have only used the maps and gps once or twice, but it worked when I used it. I know there are flubs, but definitely not a deal breaker. They will have these very small issues worked out within the span of me owning the phone, so no big deal. Battery life has been great so far. It lasts through the day. The phone's speed is a huge improvement and I love 4g lte speed when it's on. I know Sprint is working on this as well and it won't be long before this is on all the time. Bottom line though, in a week and a half or so, I have not lost a signal or dropped any calls. I have always been online, so the coverage has been great. If you like a phone in your pocket, this is the lightest and thinnest you will find. Hardly notice it's there. Great phone overall. Highly recommended.
the iPhone 5 its a good phone just not on sprint!! you get unlimited internet at print but super slow internet ,its the worst service i ever had on internet !! don't buy this phone for sprint carrier
I had an iPhone 4 before this, this phone blows it out of the water in terms of size, screen resolution, speed, weight, it's all great. The battery is reasonable when in normal use but drains when playing anything graphic intensive but that goes for any phone. Apple will always prevail in this market. As a side note, didn't realize how useful Siri would be!
So far there is a lot to like with few exceptions.
In general this iPhone is as good as any other iPhone but with a couple improvements that should've been done a year or two ago. I've have had every iPhone, and finally they put in a bigger screen but not big enough compared to other phones out their, another thing is apple should really think about increasing the battery life. 4 inch screen is not going to cut it. Come on apple add features that other phones don't have, give us something that we can have that android doesn't.
The iPhone 5 is a great phone if you want an easy-to-use/ do-it-all type of device. Overall a great phone. This phone is also very fast compared to the previous generations of iPhones. I tested the speed over LTE and got just over 29 Mbps download speed. If AT&T did not have a cap on the data, I would get rid of my broadband at home. I love the size and weight of the unit as well.
The iPhone 5 is a great phone for anyone that needs to effectively use the latest technology in a simple and easy to learn device. While the rants will tell you that others are innovating well beyond Apple, I suggest that the iPhone provides the vast majority of users with exactly what they really "need" vs. catering to the wants of the uber technology geek. I want a phone that easy to use, that I can't easily break through configurations and has a large app base that will suite all my personal/professional needs. The iPhone meets these needs and goes well beyond.
When I first got the phone, the camera wouldn't open. So I took it to the store and they reset it for me. But since then it has been just as glitchy and the apps do not function all the time.
love the iphone 5 cause I already know how to use it and I can do lots of things no it like go on the internet, and post pics and check my mail
Overall the iPhone continues to be powerful phone. Apple has once again perfected the iPhone
Got the Iphone5. Complaint.....None of my Bluetooth devices work. That Sucks
I pre - ordered the phone and was happy to wait for it so I could see the first reviews. I have read some negative things but considering that over 5 million phones were sold it is not unreasonable to anticipate a few phones with problems. I asked about the return policy and held on to my iPhone4s for safety measures. Since I could return the phone I decided to buy it. I have an iPad 3 and a MAC BOOK PRO so I want to keep everything APPLE. I love the phone. It has exceeded my expectations so far. I am very impressed with the battery life as well of how fast the battery charges. The sound quality is excellent. So far I have had no problems with the phone. I have a USB outlet in my car and the IPOD function works great. It displays the entire menu on the GPS Navigation Screen and allows me to use the touch screen to change songs, etc There have been no problems with light leaks, screen bubbles, excessive data usage, purple in photos, etc. The display quality is excellent and I love the longer screen. It makes a big difference in Facebook, etc. It is very lightweight which is easy to get used to. I think I made a great choice and if any problems creeps up I will add to this post but very happy so far. I think you will have no regrets buying the phone.
Upgraded from iphone 4 to the 5 and with the larger screen and Siri capability, I am really enjoying the new hardware. My complaints are the same as every other iphone Apple has released: the battery. If you want great battery life, turn off every bell and whistle the phone has to offer, which defeats the purpose of having the features in my opinion. If Apple would just truthfully, say, "It's an iphone, your battery is gonna suck, get used to it" instead of making untrue promises in regards to the battery, I would have more faith in their marketing claims.
I love this phone. I've had the 3GS and the 4. This is such a vast improvement over previous models. iOS 6 is fantastic. It is fast and responsive. The processor is incredible. My flight simulator apps run smoothly and open quickly.
I have grandfathered unlimited data and a number of paid productivity apps, so I'm pretty much locked in to the AT&T iPhone until they take my unlimited data away. As usual with Apple, the device is beautiful, but it has to go in a case, or it won't stay that way for long. When they made the screen longer, they should have reoriented some things like the favorites screen to the bottom for one-handed use, or at least have given that as an option. Battery life is unpredictable and overall mediocre. I still love my iPhone, and would recommend that anybody look at it as an option, but if I were a first-time buyer with complete freedom, I might very well buy something different. I would recommend the iPhone for a person who is not tech oriented and who wants a great device that just works without having to understand anything under the hood.
Can't complain about it yet, faster processor, 4g capability, but I do wish battery life wasn't so short.
I AM VERY PLEASED WITH THE VOICE ACTIVATION FEATURES AND THE RAPID SEARCH
i like my new phone compared to my previous 4S since it's lighter and thin. It's quite fast when i surf the net. Battery is ok since it gives me about 2-3 days depending on my usage.
Great Phone to high price. Best camera they have out so far.
iPhones rock! Best by far!!! Siri kicks [butt] !!!
I had the I phone 4 previous to this I phone 5. The new I phone 5 in my opinion is a leap forward in technology in every aspect. The browsing speed is improved. The responsiveness is improved. The call clarity is improved. The screen is improved and a little bigger. It is better in every way than the previous generation I Phone
The iphone5 is a definate improvement over the iPhone 4S One of the best features of the new phone is the LTE capability and along with the faster processor speed, there is a much improved Internet speed. The LTE also pulls in signals that the 4g on the iphone4s was not able to get. I take a train from Chicago suburbs to the downtown area every day and the improved range is very much improved. Looking forward to the iPhone 6!!
I have had an iPhone 3 and 4 and the 5 is by far the best iPhone to date. The LTE is faster then my wifi at home and the bigger processor chip makes a HUGE difference!! Apps load instantly and no screen lag at all when moving from screen to screen. The layout is better and the updated phone settings to ignore calls is great. The e-mail app has also been updated and works much better......I even have no issue with the map program....If you want to get from A to B....it works fine in my opinion. The iPhone 5 is the benchmark smartphone that all others stride for but fall short.
Very good phone. Easy to use. I would recommend this phone to anyone.
I have been using the iPhone since the first one came out and as usual, I picked up this phone the day it came out. Don't get me wrong, this thing is a beauty - simple and elegant and will do all the things that you would expect from an iPhone. But I am really disappointed by the quality of pictures that this phone takes. The purple tint that the pictures have when you take a picture with any source of light in the corners is really unacceptable. Since the iPhone 4, I had been using the iPhone as a replacement to my point and shoot and this problem with the 5 is a dealbreaker for me. And battery life while on LTE sucks. So if you take a lot of pictures like me you have two options, go back and use the older iPhone 4s (which has a great camera) or you could just switch to a more powerful Galaxy s3. Your choice.
Really like the phone. the reception has improved from the previous iPhone.
iPhone 4S owners may not notice anything more special about the 5, but upgrading from the iPhone 3, like me, makes a significant difference. So far, this is a happy, repeat customer!
Overall, another great product from Apple. There have been some minor complaints about the Maps app, but I personally think they're overblown. If you want a fast, reliable piece of equipment, it doesn't get any better than the iPhone 5.
I've had three iPhones--the 5 is the worst for the Internet. If you don't mind dial-up speeds or Internet non-connections, it is great as an iPod. The 4LTE exists only in a few small areas of the Minneapolis metro area; that's ATT's fault. At home, the wifi speed is much slower than my old 3GS or my wife's 4. That's an Apple fault that may be fixed in the future, but just read the forums before you buy. Well, I just had to have it, so my bad.
This phone improved on all the right stuff Better Call quality Bigger screen while still being able to hold with one hand great battery life despite the lte antenna better color saturation in the screen Still has the best digital media player of any smart phone on the market moved all the ports on the bottom.
Very nice phone, 4g speeds are very fast , battery life is good ,4in screen is perfect for the iPhone and the design is amazing ....overall it's the best iPhone
I ran out of space on my 32gb iphone 4s just as the iphone 5 was about to be released. I am a heavy apps user, heavy texter and heavy picture-taker. This phone is so much more faster than the 4s and has so much more space. I love it. I hate that the charger was changed because now I have to buy a new set of chargers for my car and home.
Hi bought this for a not so tech savvy friend. He had just transitioned from the BlackBerry to the iPhone and was uncomfortable with the virtual keyboard. I got this for him to alleviate his separation anxiety. the product is well thought out, has an on and off switch so you don't waste the battery, and you can use the same charger as your iPhone. It was the deal of the day and for $32 and change well worth it.
Got it because I thought it was cool but I was mistaken. Can't see the keys in the dark. Seems like it was cheaply made. It did work.. Got it as the deal of the day and could not even think about someone paying full price. Wouldn't let a friend get it but maybe a stranger...
The case is really nice. It fits the phone pretty well except for the top portion. Mine seems to have a small gap between the phone and the case but other than that, the case is nice. It isn't so bulky and it is very slim in width so it doesn't make the phone any wider looking. About 1/2" thick. Great buy for the price!
Tried this on a whim because my regular flavor was sold out. Nice flavor.
I enjoy this coffee brand so much that I had to go and buy my own because we have some at work but they finish so fast. Now I have a box of my own.
Keurig system coffee makes are great and the selection of coffees are amazing!
My wife is the coffee drinker and she loves this coffee.
I don't like the dark roast or strong coffee's and this one wasn't that way. It was delicous. Smooth taste. Great coffee
great taste and very strong with not too much french vanilla taste
I didn't realize it until I'd opened the package, but the product was expired at the time I purchased it (perhaps that is why it was on sale)!
Keurig's french vanillas k-cups make a wonderful cup of french vanilla coffee and when you add half & half, you are in for a treat that can't be beat !!
This brand of K cups is excellent. The flavor is great and the taste is better than I expected. I look forward to my morning cup of cofee even more now.
this k cup is hands down the highest quality, best tasteing coffee ever!!!!!!!!!! believe me it is worth the money. in fact if you calculate it up, each cup is $0.50....fifthy cents!!!!!! thats awesome
ANYONE THAT LIKES VANILLA SHOULD USE THIS FLAVOR. IT'S NOT OVERPOWERING BUT TASTES JUST RIGHT.
I like flavored coffee that have hints of vanilla in them. My favorite is carmel vanilla but I did not see this available in store. I have tried other brands of vanilla coffee and have been disappointed. This one is pretty good
Is no mutch coffe in it, comes out water down even on the small cup of the machine.
coffee lover who is still tweaking the right brands and flavors for my Keurig Mini. Price on this item was grrrreat. looked forward to gourmet cup of Hazlenut flavored coffee......Added the EXACT amount of water for the intended portion....resulted in the weakest, watery-thin, light, flavorless coffee i EVER HAD. Worse so, due to the fact i debuted my Keurig beverage experience with it. BRIGHT SIDE: Green Mountain & Dunkin' Donuts have redeemed my close call of Buyers Remorse. don't cha mess with a thugs' morning mug!!!.
Coffee is a personal preference and, of all the coffee K-cups offered when I purchased my Keurig coffee maker 2 years ago, my favorite remains Gloria Jean's Hazelnut Flavored Coffee. I do not like bold, Espresso-type coffee but like this flavor which is mild and doesn't leave a bitter after taste. Starbuck's does not equal Gloria Jean's Hazelnut Flavored Coffee!
tastes great but kind of weak if you like strong coffee
coffee has a great smell when brewing, strong enough to wake me up.
Roasted Stuff; this is one of the best i had;Roasted Stuff; this is one of the best i had;Roasted Stuff; this is one of the best i had
Ordered Gloria Jean's K-cup Hazelnut flavored coffee for my Keurig machine and Best Buy had the best prices and their delivery was very prompt and fast. Would order from them again. Didn't realize Best Buy had such a diverse line of products one could order via the internet. Very happy with this purchase.
Great blend if you're going for a delicious taste, but not recommended if you are looking for something bold.
What can I say about coffee? It's Hazlenut and being my favorite flavor, I do really like it. Besides, the little "K cups" are so convenient that I find myself making cups of coffee during the day even when I am not all that thirsty for coffee. Altho the box is a bit expensive, if you do not drink gallons of coffee each day, the monthly price is manageable.
The hazelnut flavor is not too strong. The coffee could is not bad if your a light coffee drinker.
I have tried many K-cups and I wish I tried this one before I purchased a box of it. It does not taste like Hazelnut and has a very weird taste. I would try something else. I tried a second cup and it was the same thing.
Great tasting flavored coffee. Can be bought cheaper elsewhere!
This is a great way to get a great cup of coffee fast and not lose flavor.
i like mild coffee so this was a little strong for me
Caribou Coffee is great tasting coffee and is convienient to make with the Keurig coffee maker. It's coffee shop quality coffee as good/better than Starbuck's. I visited a Caribou Coffee Shop in the MSP Airport and I found that the coffee shop version and the at home version of the coffee are both excellent. I first became aware of Caribou Coffee at a Minnesota Twins game when I visited Minneapolis recently. There was a rain delay at the game and an ad at the game stated when it rains, we pour offering a discount on Caribou Coffee within 24 hours of the game. My Sister-in-Law pointed the ad out and said that the coffee was as good as Starbuck's Coffee. She was right! I took my Twins ticket stub to the Caribou Coffee Shop in the MSP Airport and received a discount on my coffee. I'm glad that I tried Caribou Coffee.
Is a great product! Only wish they came in packs of more! And maybe would help it priced was a slight bit lower.
We have tried a huge amount of different brands and bleds of K-cup coffees. This one is by fare the best all round blend for those who families with varying ideas of a "good" cup of coffee. This one satisfies all the different taste levels in my home.
Caribou is my favorite brand for K-Cup coffee. I love the taste, just wish there were 20 per box instead of 18.
Before getting my Keurig coffee maker, I was not a big fan of the concept of single serving coffee makers. Now I love it, and Best Buy offers the best selection of K-cups and the best price around. I looked!!
The K-cup version of Caribou Blend Coffee is great. And, I really like the fact we can get this at Best Buy for those times we don't plan ahead and don't have time to drive to our favorite Caribou to pick up a box. Our local Best Buy is closer than any of the Caribou Coffee shops. Also, it's handy to pick up a box when we are already in Best Buy shopping for other items.
I got Keurig K-Cup Caribou Blend Coffee just so we had some Caribou Coffee K-Cups. Not our favorite, so we give it to guests and they all say its good.
This blend is not too strong or too weak. It has a good taste to it. Out of all the flavors we have tried, this one is our favorite.
A great coffee. We have to make a secial stop at best buy just to buy a box when we go shopping.
i'm always looking for that perfect tasting cup of coffee. My dad loved his coffee and having a Keurig k-cups with all the diverse types available would have made him smile more than he did. Thank you for assisting me in my quest.
Hubby loves the flavor and zip he gets with this coffee. Best one we have found, so far. It is very strong yet not bitter.
I love coffee and this was surprisingly just as titled Revv. I get my boost of energy and I'm off to work with a mission to be greater than day before. Its more than most k-cups but so worth it I think.
Bought this for the extra kick it was supposed to have and it lives up to it claim. I use it on the tall cup of my Kuerig, a little Frenc Vanilla and it is just the thing. It seems that everyone must like it because it is not available every time I am at BB.
A bold strong coffee with a kick, Dont use before bedtime, but down a cup before you go out for the night!
This product really packs a punch of caffeine. Kind of expensive for a shot of coffee but it is a good shot.
good tasting coffee if you like it strong and bold. if not, try the donut shop one.
This is a great coffee for anyone who loves their coffee strong. It packs an energy punch and this is what my husband really likes about it. It is like drinking an energy drink but with the taste of coffee instead of the nasty fruity flavor that most energy drinks come in. If you need something to wake you up in the morning this is your coffee. Their price is good if you just want to try a small box of it to taste but I have found a larger box of it for cheaper on Keurig's website.
This is my 2nd favorite coffee - the Rev Plus is the best. Although it is a bold brew, it tastes very flavorful and smooth - not bitter.
The shaking sound the cup makes is different then the other K-cups. The flavor is a very strong and bold taste. Four cups should be enough for any human being who loves their coffee and who wants that espresso kick at home without wasting money on an espresso machine.
Most of the coffee's that I have purchased, or have been given to me, were good. This one is no exception. I gladly recommend it.
I have one 'vice' left and that would be caffiene........I like my coffee as strong as Texas Mule p*ss and this Rev seems to do the trick without being nasty tasting
Good taste not like the usual "BURNT" blends but silky and wow what a ZIP!!
Revv caught my eye at Best Buy of all places. The idea intrigued me. I consider myself a pretty heavy coffee drinker (strictly americano brew lately). I enjoy a hearty brew, and stick exclusively to dark roast Keurigs. Although I didn't notice any "extra" energy (caffeine), I do consume a lot of caffeine to begin with. The taste was good but I more highly prefer others.
I love strong coffee and this is the strongest K-Cup Coffee I have found.
If you are looking for a strong cup of coffee this is it, but I think the taste could be better. I drink my coffee black, so there is nothing covering up the flavor, which I think is a bit bitter. My husband likes a little coffee with his cream and sugar and he thinks it is just ok. We are heavy coffee drinkers and would not buy this as our primary coffee choice.
This stuff smells like the swill at a cruddy gas station or truck stop, and tastes like what's covering their bathroom walls. I imagine there's a price for shoving even more caffeine and other invigorating agents into coffee, but it isn't worth it. Just pour yourself a second cup of whatever you ordinarily drink, instead.
If you have a Keurig, and I am guessing you do, this is a good addition to the collection. It's kinda the underdog of "energy" coffees. It's inexpensive and tastes great. I am a dark roast type of drinker. I cannot prove that it "Revvs" you but It's a good deal for the price.
This is a very tasty tea. I do add more Splenda. We stretch out the amount of tea by using a tall glass without ice. I brew 1 large cup and then with the same pack, I brew a small cup, as well, Then pour the hot tea over ice and I can get 2 large glasses from 1 pack. We love to drink our tea! This makes it a little more affordable.
At first I thought the taste was a bit strong, but it just meant I needed a bigger cup with more ice.
I really like this ice tea product, the taste is great and it is not too sweet. I also like that I can get two brews out of the k-cup and combined them into one large ice tea drink, without minimizing the flavor.
This tea is so good, I dont even have to add sugar.
Perfect for a quick glass of tea just the way I like it, also tastes great hot with a little honey.
I love the combo of tea and lemonade. Its a prefect blend of the two not one is over powering the other like some premade drinks out there on the market.
Not my favorite flavor. It really tastes artificial. It needs more lemon flavor.
I am a huge tea fanatic and most of the time I brew loose leaf tea only. However, when I just want something quick and refreshing I usually use my Keurig and this Half and Half does the job perfectly. Just brew over ice, stir to get the sweetness balanced, and enjoy! It does leave a slightly bitter after taste but that is indicative to black teas.
I liked Arnold Palmers version of half ice tea half lemonade, but after a while, the sweetness of it was getting to me. I'm glad I found a new half tea half lemonade. Taste much better and not sweet.
Out of all the ice teas for Kuerig this is the best.
It's unique taste is a welcome change. Anyone wanting to try something different should try this flavor.
Doesnt even remotely taste like Kahlua. Worse flavor K-cup so far
I really wanted to like this coffee, as I really like flavored coffee and I REALLY like Kahlua. The coffee itself leaves a little to be desired. It tastes somewhat over-roasted, and has a bit of a chickory taste to it. I really didn't taste any Kahlua taste in it at all. If it were just this, I would probably give it a three-star rating (average), but the smell just kills it. It really stinks when brewed. It smells a little burned. but there is something else there that I can't put my finger on. It just smells awful. My wife walked into the house about an hour after I brewed a single cup, and she exclaimed 'YUK - What it that SMELL?' I would have chalked it up to a bad batch, but I bought two boxes from different stores before I tried it the first time (lesson learned) and they are both identical. I just can't recommend this stuff to anyone.
Timothy's Kahlua Coffee is great. Once you try a cup it will be hard to switch.
It doesn't taste anything like a white or black russian (drink) but it is still the best flavored coffee I have found. I think I taste a little coconut in it though it is not listed as an ingredient, definitely worth trying if you like a little extra in your coffee!
The product was expired by 2 months. That may be why they had it on clearence.
Wonderful variety and flavors of coffee & tea's. No mess no filters or grounds to clean up.
Great dispenser for my K-Cups and allows me to display a sample of each on.
My boyfriend and I purchased one package but found 2 of these dispensers just wasn't enough, so we purchased another pair because we liked them so much. We really love the way these look as well as how convenient they are to access.
These probably cut your needed shelf space in half. I hate to say it, but they probably are worth the $25, though I really wish they were more in the $15-$20 range. I still need 4-5 more. Also, if you just dump the K-cups in, you can easily store @24 however if you lay them all flat on their side and alternate left to right, you can probably fit more like 30 or maybe a few more.
We drink a lot of Hot chocolate and apple cider. These fit great in the cabinets and easy to access and refill.
measure your cabinets before you go, would not fit in any of my cabinets but found the perfect place in my pantry! there is a hole in the front that holds a k--cup and that way you know what flavor you reaching for! perfect for the whole family, use for coffee, tea, hot chocolate or what ever flavor or brand you want!
the coffee is grat taste and strong taste with a good kick
Best Buy allows a great value on coffee by competitive pricing along with coupons for greater savvings!
Most delicious coffee I have ever had. Say this each tme I drink it!
This coffee, as I have stated above is delicious. The problem is, that out of the 18 cups, only two didnt fail. The Keurig would start to brew and be about half done, then the foil top of the cup would simply detach from cup in a spot, and the grounds would come spilling out. Almost as if whatever adhesive was used melted. Never had a problem with other cups. So, perhaps this was simply this batch of the product, but a co-worker had expressed a similar issue with Newman's Own cups months prior, but I had just figured that THAT was a bad batch of cups....
Newman's Own Organics Extra Bold Coffee is personally one of my favorite K-Cup coffees. It's rich flavorful coffee, without any hint of bitterness sometimes found in others. FYI...Carabou coffee is my other personal favorite. I enjoy both served black without any cream(ers) or sugar. I would definitely recommend either brand.
This is the best coffee yet for the Keurig. Bold, full flavor. We love it.
This is a good K cup for those of you who like strong flavorful coffee. If you like a light or medium roast then I would go with a different K cup.
I have tried other Newman's Own products and they have all been good. So, I thought the coffee would be too. It was not. I could not even finish the cup and I like all types of coffees, including bold. Thinking it was a fluke with either the K-cup or the coffeemaker, I made another cup. It was the same: bad. In the future, I will stay away from Newman's Own coffee and continue buying the other coffees available for the Keurig.
There are not many organic options. This is a good one. Smooth and bold, but not bitter.
There are so many choices when it comes to buying K-Cups. You are not always sure which ones to buy. Well, I highly recommend this one. This is now my favorite K-Cup. It has a rich, bold taste without the acid, bitterness found in some coffees.
Keurig K cupsare perfect for the single person to the family with other taste ! about a min. to brew 1 cup and the coffee's out there are getting hard to find.. this is one of the better blends.. not too bold not too mild just right if you are a coffee lover..
Really good coffee. I will be getting a lot more. I just wished the the coffee would make a 12 oz cup. My coffee make will only do 9.25 oz.
One of the best organic coffees you can purchase. It has a smooth but solid taste and there is no bitter after taste with this prodct.
I love the rich, velvety boldness of Newman's Organic Extra Bold. It is my favorite non-flavored, caffeinated K-Cup coffee flavor!
Great flavor & quality, bold; perfect for the morning, it really wakes you up!
This has been what I start my day with! At less than 58 cents each this is a great buy.
This is my favorite coffee among all K-cups. It has just the right consistency. Not too dark but still rich and tasty.
I really love this coffee. I think it is great that it is available at Best Buy due to the fact that is one of my favorite shopping places. I love the Kuerig and the coffees but Donut Shop is one of mine and my family's very favorite ones.
It's funny, out of all the places I can purchase this coffee, including by mail, it is the cheapest at Best Buy. Who would have thought? The only problem is when I go in to Best Buy to buy the coffee...I see lots of other stuff I want too. :)
Keurig Donut Shop Coffee is great. Best Buy offered a great value on this item. When I used my Best Buy coupon the savings was even greater.
Not as good as Dunkin Donuts coffee but it is only available at DD stores.
It really was delicious and smelled great as it was being prepared. Just like the coffee shop down the street.
The cups are too expensive and are not evironmentally good. Prefer to use my refillable basket.
I still try other coffees but always come back to this one.
Buy It!! This is the stuff coffee is meant to taste like....
This coffee the bomb yo. I've tried the different flavors that come with the starter pack and a variety of others, this is definitely one of the best kcups out there. Plus donut shops are the coolest.
I usually get the Columbian Fair Trade Blend from Green Mountain but thought I would try the Donut Shop Coffee. It tasted good but I like my coffee a little stronger. The rest of the family liked it so we will continue to buy it.
Extra Bold flavor allows for making a larger mug of coffee (more water) while still getting the big bold flavor of this selection. Highly recommended
I recomend this coffee to everyone. Great taste and quality
Great product , excellent taste and very flavorful. Pricing for these K-Cups good be better.
This coffee is sooo good! I use the Southern Pecan Cream with it, it is amazing! Very smooth, very yummy!
quick strong coffee gotta love it. when you are looking for strong coffee in the world of instant this is it
Great coffee for someone who actually enjoys deep bold flavors and not for the coffee drinkers who prefer the "brown" water type.
It performs well and lets you use a larger variety of coffee.
I usually don't do the review thing, but if I can prevent one person the frustration that this product has caused me, it was worth the effort. First off, when removing the original K-cup housing, a ridge is left in place that prevents this from fitting my Keurig properly and without forcing the lid down and holding it, it will not brew. When it does, the coffee produced is watered down and disappointing. I tried it without the lid, I tried it without the spout... and I came to the conclusion that I wasted too much money on a poorly thought out and poorly engineered product that was over-priced. Don't bother with it.
It took me a few tries before I got it to even work without making a huge mess. If you don't get the lid on just right water and coffee goes everywhere. It does not make the coffee strong enough for me. Some of the water gets through without going through the coffee grounds!? It is not what I expected. You have to take out the original basket to use it and it is too much of a hassle to use all the time.
The cost is a little high, but it saves money on the coffee side. Works as advertised so far, but don't forget to put the cover on.
Good product. Nice to be able to use my own coffee and not K cups all the time. Bit of a pain to clean but not bad. Use the sink sprayer and it speeds up the process.
My only real complaint with this is that it doesn't seat completely in the machine, so I have to stand and hold down the handle while it runs. Really annoying, and I'm afraid I'm damaging the machine in the long run. Also messy to clean up the metal filter, but that's more of a nuisance than anything.
I wish there were a way to use paper filters with the K machines. I use the K-cup machine as a backup to my Senseo. The Senseo is far superior in all ways but apparently is no longer manufactured.
I can use coffee that I have before I bought the keurif brewer.
I brew my name brand coffee or tea in this k cup when all I awant is plain coffee or tea
Works well and is much cheaper than the pods. I use it daily.
Works great every time !! I have not had any of the problems listed in other reviews.
My unit allows coffee grounds into the drinking cup.. It also runs over spilling outside the cup...
Easy to fill and use, good for when you want to make your own coffee which I prefer. Not easy to clean
I love the fact that I can use my own coffee with the Keurig. I drink mostly Dunkin Donuts, the whole bean. I just grind my beans up and then put the ground coffee in the reusable coffee filter. It also works with tea and you can put the sugar in with the tea. Great product!!!
This makes excellent hot beverages. Fantastic hot drinks in your own kitchen!
We love the option to use ground coffee. It makes the cost per cup better.
Works exactly as expected, only draw back is the price. $18 for a small piece of plastic seems excessive. But did not stop me from purchase. Also the single cup have this problem even with their K-cups, but it seems like the water goes through to quickly. Occasionally you get a watered down drink.
Easy to use, well made product. Saves money and reduces waist. I have been using mine for a year and still loving it.
With this filter, you can use your own coffee with the Keurig brewer. Makes it very convenient and helps save you some money.
Perfect for saving money on coffee! No need to buy those coffee "pods" that cost way too much.
I love the flexibility this item give me when choosing to use tea bags or ground coffee.
The reusable filter is great. I know I am saving coffee and money at the same time. Costs is a little high at $17 but will save that after few bags/cans of coffee over the pods. Would be nice to find a reusable filter by itself without the casing as I usually make a cup of coffee for myself as well as one for my sweetie.
I received my Keurig coffee maker for Christmas and I love it. However, there are some times I want to brew coffee that does not come in the cups available. I saw an add for the K-cup reuseable refill and thought to give it a try. It really works great. As a retiree I need to save money and it's definately cheaper to brew your own coffee. The only small problem is that it's a little work to clean the filter after use but not an issue for not using it.
This Keurig accessory works well and I like being able to use freshly ground coffee instead of the Keurig pods all the time. It's easy to use but you have to take out the holder in the Keurig and replace it with this which seems unnecessary especially since I found a different coffee pod that's easier to use. Nonetheless, a good product for the money.
Everyone loves the convenience of owning and using a Keurig. What no one ever seems to inform non-Keurig owners is the fact that those tiny K-Cups can be very expensive when compared to buying a normal bag o'joe. It's my guess that one $11 box of K-Cups only equals about 4 whole pots of coffee. That's a huge difference when I can make about 10 or more full pots of coffee from an $8 bag of coffee. Hey, K-Cups are great but they are a luxury. To keep some extra cash in your pocket, this great addition to your Keurig will allow you to use your much cheaper bag of coffee. And when money is not an issue, use a tasty K-Cup.
Love our new Keurig and the My K-cup filter! I think we're actually saving coffee and money compared to our old Brewstation. We were throwing away coffee most days and now this container is lasting a lot longer. The K-cup is easy to use and clean out.
This is a nifty little gadget for when I want to use coffee but not a K-Cup. It allows me to use ground coffee at a fraction of the cost of K-cups so I can grind my own coffee beans and use this
Water and grounds leak all over the machine and the cup. Does not produce a drinkable cup of cofee. A total disaster. Do not waste your money.
So glad to have bought this coffee filter as it comes in handy when Kcup coffee is not availble.
It is a very useful type of coffee maker. You have frest coffee and good coffee at your fingertips.
The My K-Cup is great for when I'm out of K-Cups or if I want to manage the strength of my coffee. It's quite durable and clean up is easy. I highly recommend it!
Must have for those of us who like coffee and do not want to pay the $$$ for the K-Cups. Yes you need to clean out the grinds and that can be a bit of a pain but your own coffee in a single use maker - for me the benefits out-weigh the negatives.
When I first purchased my K- cup to brew my own coffee it didnt work well at all, the coffee leaked all over and it wasnt a steady stream when brewed. The coffee came out watery and had grounds in it. ****TRICK**** I noticed that the hole on the plastic K-cup is bigger than the holes punctured into a disposable k-cup, so i pulled the rubber seal located on the needle inside, down to the tip of the needle then closed it, you can feel how tighter it is when you close it. That prevents it from leaking and gives you a steady brew, now my coffee comes out great! Hope this helps!
I looked at all the reviews for this and half of the people had problems. I got mine and tried it out. Not a problem. Was very easy to use, it did not leak or make a mess and the coffee was very good. Easy to clean. So if time is not a problem, an extra 20 secs. to fill and 30 secs. to wash this thing is great.
OK for a quick cup of coffee, but it doesn't use all the grounds only what is in the center. And then when you try to empty it, it makes a huge mess.
I like being able to make coffee with my own grind of coffee in the Keurig coffee-maker. It certainly costs a lot less money than purchasing K-cups. However, the reusable K-cup tends to leak a little bit. Not gushes of coffee, but a few drops always seem to wind up on the coffee-maker, and not in my mug of Joe. Also, the price of the reusable K-cup is highway robbery, plain and simple.
This is a great addition. Allows use of holday coffees not produced in k-cups
It lets me pick what I use in Keurig. Should make things cheaper in the long run to have good coffee at home.
I have tried all the alternate Keuring devices to brew my own coffe through the machine. None have worked out well. Then I bought this one. This one is actually made by the Keurig, it was worst then the other ones. I follow the instructions step by step. Still comes out watery and tasteless.
The pricing conspiracy regarding K-Cups rivals that of Apple, Inc products, but this item allows me to enjoy my Keurig for about 40 cents a cup! Works great, easy to clean and easy to install/uninstall.
it does fit the keurig and you can and your own coffee but the cup that you will get is weak .. The water pressure from the keurig does not reach the grounds in the middle and with the screens on the sides it doesn't have time to saturate the grounds to get the best cup of coffee you can get
We bought the Keurig because a friend of ours had one. But the cost and waste of the K-cups seemed too much for us. With this, we can use our own favorite grind of coffee beans if we want, and it works great. It's easy to clean, and the screen is durable, as long as you don't use a bottle brush inside it. We've been using one for a couple years now, and it holds up really well. It's a lot easier than the paper filter, measured water carafe, wait to percolate kind of coffee maker, and it's less wasteful and messy.
I think it is a great way to be able to use my own coffee, for those times I might not have money to buy K-cups. It is a bit pricy but what do you expect when it is Kuerig. Overall it is a good value.
This has worked perfectly. It makes a great cup of coffee or tea! The cost savings are great and gives a much larger variety of coffees and teas to brew. Time saving to use prepacked cups and budget saving to use this insert.
Leaks all over the place; poorly designed; a disgrace to the Keurig name. Take it off market until it can be properly designed & manufactured. Threw mine in trash first day; could not get it to stop leaking even after cleaning brewer with toothbrush!!!
When using this filter system, water drips all over even after the coffee is done brewing. It is also a pain to remove the whole kcup tray to put this filter in.
I guess Keurig didn't want to make the re-usable filter better tasting than the K-Cups or you'd stop buying the K-Cups. Pulling the rubber washer down to the tip of the metal point that pierces the K-Cup fixes the water overflowing. However, the water still flows too quickly and brews a weak cup of coffee. To fix this, I took a USED K-Cup with the hole in the bottom, removed the foil from the top, removed all the plastic liner inside the K-cup, then placed the "hollowed" K-Cup into the filter housing. You may need to turn the housing upside-down on the counter and press firmly to get it to go in far enough. Then put the removable filter basket in and put the lid on. This slows the water flow to make the coffee stronger. Very happy with product now.
This filter works great on my Platinum Keurig. I have no problem with water overflow like others report. I use 2.5 tsps of "percolator" ground coffee from whole beans for the my tastes. I find the K-Cups are far too strong, so using my own grounds works great for me. I even like loose leaf tea in it. I can get 3 cups of hot tea with a reasonable amount of loose leaf tea leaves (but don't tell the tea lovers that because they will frown if you use tea leaves more than once!). Add a ripe raspberry or orange slice to the tea leaves before brewing for awesome taste.
This is a real money savor, but it takes a little work. To clean the re-usable filter, you have to clean it out after each use. This is best done by letting it dry before emptying the grounds. The problem then is, if you are making more than one cup, it is best to have more than one reusable filter, so that one can be drying, while you use the other. The other problem is that if you use regular ground coffee, a very small amount of it will will end up in the bottom of your cup. (kurig does recommend that you use coarse ground coffee. I guess you can say that these issues take away from the main selling point of the Keurig Coffee Maker, that being, the ease and convenience of the machine.
As much as my wife loves her Keurig Special Edition coffee maker, she hates the reuseable filter! Using the pre-packaged K cups is quick, easy and CLEAN! Very minimal clean-up. Using the reuseable filter is none of that. The water leaks out of the top of the filter, allowing water and coffee grounds to pour into your cup and all over the counter! What you end up with is a very weak cup of coffee with grounds in it and a big mess to clean up! My wife loves and highly recommends the coffee maker as long as you stick with the pre-packaged K cups. DO NOT waste your money on this reuseable filter!
It leaks like crazy. Water goes all over the place, not only in the tray but also on the counter where it's leaking from the head unit itself. SUpport not very good, though this is fairly new, wouldn't replace it, told me "go buy another one, it's something wrong with the one you have"...lol
Only get it though if you have bagged coffee that you must have. Otherwise, just peruse the keurig website for hundreds of varieties that are already perfectly portioned for you.
I use this with a B60 and it does work, but also waters up the counter at the same time. I figured cool, I can clean the counter at the same time. NOT COOL. Two calls to KuuRag yielded " You have to pull down the grommet , bla, bla, bla... Not for this kinda money. Go buy a 10pack of Danco 1/2L 88578 Faucet Washers at Depot. Dremel out center hole so it doesn't snag on the water needle. Drop it into the top recessed portion of the reusable and Start brewing your very own K-Cup coffee, with no leaks. Yee Haa!!
I really do like the reusable filter, just because I can use my own coffee! It works great except that some water spouts past the cup and there is no way to catch it with the cup. However, the drip tray catches it so there is no problem!
This filter does a good job but its cost $14.99 is way to high for just a piece of simple molded plastic...It must be cleaned after each use as well.
I love it because you don't have to buy K cups unless you want to. I use all my own coffees. Easy to clean and works great.
First of all I love the Keurig brewing system. The coffee in the Factory sealed k cups are some of the best I have ever tasted. In an effort to try and bring down the costs I decided to try the "MY K cup". I am a heavy coffee drinker and always go for the gusto. Using my own coffee (extra bold) in the "My K cup" resulted in a very weak brew. I have tried some of the tricks to help the strength on google, but nothing really works. All we get is a hole blown down thru the center of the coffee filter resulting in dry coffee grounds on the sides of the filter causing a weak cup of coffee. For the money this "My K cup" costs has me a bit concerned why others have not complained. That is unless you like weak coffee..
The coffee filter works good. If you don't mind about the time it takes to fill the filter with your coffee and clean it out when your done, then I recomend this. A little messy with the coffee grounds, had some in my coffee, but a real good idea compared to the cost of purchasing K-cup pods.
Nice to not have to buy the individual ones, it saves money overall
I like being able to use my own favorite coffee. It takes a little longer to set up & clean up and occasionally I forget to put the other filter basket back in.
Great product for the value, it's reusable. The great thing you can have your own gourmet coffee.
I loved the idea of being able to use my own coffee and not have to buy the expensive k-cups all the time but so far each time I've used it, I still have a metal taste...and yes I cleaned as instructed to do before use. Maybe just need to "clean" longer. Also, I don't dump my coffee grinds in the sink so it was a little inconvenient to have to scoop all the grinds out of the filter into the trash can but I guess convenience is what you give up if you don't use the k-cups.
I have used different flavers and have used less coffee in the filter you buy for your own coffee and the coffee does not taste good. The grounds even stink in the garbage container. What is wrong?
Great little filter so you can use your own coffee grounds and saves money!!
I think wet coffee grounds are gross. Trying to dump this tiny filter in the trash then cleaning in the sink is somewhat cumbersome. If you're like me and time in the morning is limited and you're making more than one cup, it may not be for you. I am considering the EZ Cup with disposable filters.
Yes the filter has its issues with weak coffee. But if it tasted the same, people would not feel empowered to be able to brew their own coffee and save money. The reviews listed here do work and help make a strong cup of joe. This is a must buy. It has saved me a ton of money. I would like to say that if you are complaining about taking literally 30 seconds to rinse grounds from this adapter then get your lazy self out there and buy the disposable cups.
Great product. Worth the price. Only downside is the time consumption of adding coffe, cleaning and going thru the steps again for an additional cup. Time vs Cost of a box of pods.
At least Kuering was smart enough to know not everyone drinks Starbucks. This cup allows your own taste. Price is a little high, but it beats buying the little cups.
The flavor was good, the kids can do this better than the original package style with hot water. The value was a bit questionable, really only could brew the smaller cup, the larger cup brew was a bit watery.
Bough these so the kids could make a cup of hot chocolate without using the microwave to heat up water and risk spilling it on themselves. They love it and so do we.
Dark Magic is my favorite coffee. It stands alone very well and also stands up to well to blending with flavored coffees ( my favorite is with hazelnut). I highly recommend this smooth, full-bodied coffee.
For those of us who prefer a stronger tasting, full bodied cup of coffee, this one fits the bill.
Product rotates, however, it takes up too much counterspace when placed alongside the coffee maker.
The Keurig coffee brewer is large and this holder is very compact and offsets the counter space for the brewer. It fits under standard cabinets if you so wish and also fits on taller pantry shelves. Easy to see the different flavors of coffee, tea, etc. Well made, good price compared to K-cup trees.
makes it easy to store coffee of different flavours
Nice product, turns with little effort. easy to fill and easy to remove the k cups
It is great and perfect addition to my Keurig set. Exactly what I wanted.
We really like the carrousel. It's easy to spin, holds 30 k-cups, doesn't take up much space and very presentable when entertaining company.
Looks great, it's sturdy, and holds lots of coffee. It also rotates, nice when you have more than one flavor stored on it.
I love it because it holds a variety of coffees and does not take up a lot of counter space. It took me a long time to find this after Christmas, I drove all over Indy. Finally was able to get it at Best buys
perfect for limited counter space locations....30 cups in 7.5 inches.. built well and looks good...no negatives
This K-Cup Carousel does not take up much room on the counter. It spins very smoothly to see all your K-Cups.
i bought this for a friend, and she loves it. it is a great space saver, as it doesn't take up much space on the counter top.
This lets me put lots of different kinds of coffee in an easy to get to and sleek looking holder.
This is a great addition to my Keurig. It provides me an opportunity to have a wide variety of coffees/ciders/teas at hand. The operation is smooth and is very compact.
Perfect for K-cups. I needed something to separate the regular from the Decaf coffee.
This unit keeps all the keurig products organized and available. Only problem is if you turn it to fast you sometimes have one or two items fall out. I like the size and ease of use.
I've bought both the stainless steel carousel version and this one and I much prefer this one as it takes up much less shelf space - and may even hold a few more K-cups. Don't be fooled by the pictures though - it comes empty.
Ready out of the box and easy to use for K-cup users
Works well at organizing our K Cups without sacrificing a lot of space.
Bought this item for my girlfriend for Christmas and she loves how convenient it is to use.
The carousel hold 30 cups, very convenient. Takes up counterspace, but if you keep it sideways when not choosing a coffee the ther is more room towork around.
Looks great and holds a variety of K-cups for quick access to your drinks.
The carousel makes it easy to store and find our favorite coffees and teas. Practical.
I like the K-cup tower because I can see what flavor is available.
This carousel is awesome to store your kcups! It holds a good amount and lets you see what flavors you have easily.
I love the Keurig carousel! The design is modern, sleek and not bulky at all. I love its 360 capabilities as well. It fits perfectly on my counter and holds just the right amount of k-cups! I will definitely recommend to friends!
I looked everywhere for this item and could not find it in stock anywhere except at Best Buy.
Product did what it needed to in attempt to hold various flavors of K-cups in a smaller area and gave good ability to see what is available. Only drawback is it needs to have more openings for more K-cups.
Highly recommended. If one buys the 'Platinum' edition Keurig machine, they may want to think about throwing this one in!
Great style and this product feels well made. Wonderful way to display k cups for easy access. Would highly recommend.
I love it. It beats pulling the containers from the box and it sit back out of the weay
This Keurig Carousel is WAY better then the other one i've seen and used at friends and familys home, it is easy to rotate, and holds more cups then the old one as well, i am very limited on counter space and this does the job above and beyond the expectations i have. Awesome purchase, def. the first accessory you should purchase after buying a keurig
This carousel tower looks so much nicer than the wire carousels I've seen on the market. It also takes up very little space yet holds 30 k cups! I checked other websites and Best Buy had the lowest price.
very handy can pick diffrent flavor everyday. Dosnt take up alot of space on counter
It doesn't feel cheaply made holds plenty of cartridges.
Fits right on the counter next to my Keurig brewer, holds plenty of K-cups, and is well built.
Swivels nicely. Great display. Looks Good. Glad I purchased the carousel along with Keurig
It makes a pretty good gift. especially for a hard to buy for person.
I love that it takes up little space. I have all my K-cups right at hand when I need them. It matches my machine and looks nice.
This is a perfect accessory for any Keurig machine. Would be nice if it came in other colors (like red, to compliment the smaller colored Keurig). But absolutely no complaints!
After doing some research my wife & I settled on this carousel. Looks snappy next to the Keurig coffee maker and holds a lot of k-cups. Also takes up a minimal amount of space. While it looks great and does what it needs to well, I am a little curious on the price. It is after all just plastic. It is however one of the cheaper carousels available.
Love Keurig machine and K-cups. I would love to see BBY have more varieties and accessories for the machine.
Overall I like the bold flavor of this product and will be purchasing it in the future.
This coffee has a nice bold flavor to it, and is one of my favorites to use in my Keurig machine.
I have yet to run into someone who owns a Keurig Coffee Maker and doesn't absolutely LOVE it! Now that we own one, I can see why!
This is my favorite K-Cup coffee. I had others that were too strong, some way too weak, and some too bitter. This is just right for me! If you like strong coffee, keep looking, this is not for you. If you like a very light coffee, keep looking. If you like a nice average coffee, this is for us.
Just an OK flavor ,a little too weak for me.When I want a K cup. I want a distinct flavor. Prefer other breakfast blends.
I think that the Keurig machine is GREAT, however, we pay TOO MUCH for the cups!! I am looking into being able to fill my own K-Cups up with my favorite coffee.
Very good tasting coffee and of course so convenient.
Keurig Green Mountain Breakfast Blend Coffee is very smooth tasting and not too strong.
I love this coffee. It has great taste, not over powering, not too weak. I drink my coffee black, so taste is very important to me, since the flavor is not covered up by sugar and cream; Breakfast blend is my go to coffee.
Iam still trying to find a morning light coffee that fits my fast. So far most have been so so,i'll keep trying
Not a bad price for the k-cups and I love the Green mountain blends
Best Coffee I hav e ever consistantly drank and easiest to prepare
This is my favorite k-cup coffee. Not only because it's smooth and delicious, but it's also in decaf, so I can drink it day or night! The only downside is the cost. There is much better value in grinding and brewin my own. :-)
We drink this DeCaf in the evening. I do wish I could buy it in an 80 cup pack, like I do with our daytime brew "Caribou Daybreak". These 2 blends are the perfect compliment. Not too weak, not bitter and always tasting the same. The Coffee People Donut Shop does not keep us awake at night, even when we drink this after 9PM.
Best tasting coffee ever. The best coffee pot ever made!
Wife likes it best of any; I would agree that it and maybe 1 other decaf have this flavor balance
Using my Kureg coffee maker is easy and having to purchase coffee all the time it's nice to know which one to go to instead of standing there wondering...... Good stuff!
Found this flavor to be a great hit here! Tastes like it came from a big name coffee shop w/o the pricetag. It is also much better for you. Will be buying more!
All the products from CAFE ESCAPES are top notch. And if you would like something different from coffee this it it. Its more like a hot choclate than a tea. Its creamy , sweet, cinamon like, and smooth. It will become one of your faves.
I do consulting for several online services, one free one for token pay, mostly to help others out, If you own one of these here is the standard practices to fix this machine when it breaks So many have failed the service had to install a specific category for coffee makers so here is the advice hoping yours works without fail, but keep it clean! ALWAYS UNPLUG THE UNIT BEFORE SERVICING Cleaning coffee maker: Pour straight vinegar into it as if you are making the coffee, no filter is need. Turn coffee maker on as if you were making a pot of coffee. Repeat this with a new batch of vinegar until it runs clear of calcium deposits. The machine is built to discourage disassembly. Even if you could get it disassembled, the process would, in itself, probably fix the problem. There are a number of valves, two pumps, feet of tubing, level probes, etc. in the machine. It's a complicated way to make coffee. With most brands, one of the tubes and/or valves becomes air locked, a bubble of air that the pump can't push through the complex system. Make sure the "hypo needles" are clean is about all a user can service. Now to that crazy sounding repair procedure: Burp and Slap IT SOUNDS CRAZY but is very successful in getting SOME MODELS to start working: UNPLUG the unit, and take out the cup holder/tray, the K-cup holder, the water reservoir. Take it to a sink and turn it upside down and slap/beat the bottom of it, side of it, back of it. For good measure, turn it right side up and shake it, and slap/swat the back and side again. DO NOT BEAT ON IT WITH SEVERE FORCE
I wouldn't be able to make chai latter myself so quick otherwise. Of course won't stand along with the proper cooked one. As long as you don't expect that - it's really good!
We love this coffee maker and the coffee, but the chi tea is just okay. We didn't care for the after taste. I won't be buying again.
better than starbucks, Best Chia tea I've tasted, Keep it on the selfs,Great anytime.
Just bought a new Keurig coupled with the Chai Latte. Absolutely love the quick brew, easy clean up, and outstanding taste. After putting off getting a Keurig for quite awhile this drink just makes me feel great about the purchase.
I love the way this looks next to my coffee maker. I keep a very varied supply of k-cups in it and there's always something great to pick from. Company enjoys getting to select from the carousel, too.
We bought this with the keurig taste is ok no compaints still have some :)
Yummy! That is ALL that has to be said. This is a wonderful treat on a cold day. My daughter loves it! Again....yummmmm!
For a change I tried the Hot Apple Cider and was disappointed. It was extremely sweet. It did offer a change from coffee or hot chocolate but only could sip for a little while.
The spiced cider for the keurig was a little on the weak side even when making the smaller sizes. I won't buy it again.
Fast - Easy - Convenient and Delicious. Add a cinnamon Stick for an enjoyable Fall Beverage !
What I really like about this one is that it's not too overwhelming with spice, so you can easily modify it if you want! So far I've tried it with a little more cinnamon and added caramel sauce, delish! It's also just good by itself with no modification.
Flavor tastes nothing like hot apple cider. Weak flat flavor. Don't waste your money!
A great tasting cider for the money. The ease of Keuring.
This product was very tasty, I was pleased that I didn't have to use sugar or anything like that to enjoy it. Once thing I would change, a softer taste, though good...it lacks smoothness. Other than that, pretty good.
if you like pumpkin buy it! I dont think the pumpkin taste is very strong so I dont think there is alot of concern of it being having too strong a pumpkin taste.
my daughter loves this its like dunkin donuts at home
I love anything pumpkin spice. I especially like the fact that I can get a great sweet and spicy taste in the morning. It will satisfy my urge for sweets all day long. I will need to stock up to ensure I have coffee till this time next year.
I really enjoyed this flavor of K-Cups. I believe it may have been on-sale when we went though I'm not completely sure. Try it with french vanilla creamer - it's super good!!
This is one of my favorite flavor K-cup, especially during the colder fall and winter months. It tastes (and smells) great and everyone who comes over loves it.
I had originally got this flavor in a variety pack and I was hooked. I was so thankful that I could find it at my local Best Buy. If you are a fan of anything pumpkin and a fan of coffee, this is for you. It's just enough pumpkin flavor to make it different but not overwhelming!
Coffee is good, one of my favorites. Kind of hard to find glad BB had it.
One of my wife's favorite coffee's. Loves the convenience.
We go through this coffee at our house like crazy! Great flavor !
I was surprised Best Buy had this item. Needed a last minute gift. This fit the bill. We love our Kuerig and this flavor rocks!!! Less than a $1 a cup.
This is a very nice cover for the Kindle. It is made really well and it protects it . Also come in some really nice colors.
I like this case because it is easy to spot in a dark bag, it is durable, and protects my Kindle Fire. The elastic band made it quick and easy to get into and serves several purposes. It props easily on the interior ridges in several positions for comfortable use. Overall, I was quite satisfied with this product.
there were a lot of choices for covers and I chose this one because it was colorful and it ended being very durable especialy since I have kids around
Great cover for the Kindle Fire. It sits up nicely if you are watching a movie. Protects the Fire. I love it! Very durable.
I would not have the strap that is attached with velcro. Too easy to lose. Would like to see an strap you can put your hand through and rest the book on the back of your hand. Arthritis in hands. Would be a great feature I haven't seen on other covers.
There are much better cases available at the same or better price. The Kindle isn't held into place with any straps or anything, it just slides in and is only held in place on one side. When positioned for viewing, half of the kindle is removed from the case. Positive, there are two viewing positions which most cases don't have. Still not a big enough positive for me to recommend this to someone.
Good quality. Good fit. Great function. ...but could not get the color I wanted.
Works great and is a quality product. Doesn't have a zip closure though, that the only reason I didn't give it a 5 star rating.
I looked at several covers for my new KindleFire. I wanted leather but not black -- something that would stand out as mine, but not be in some weird color or pattern. I also wanted a case that held the device securely, would close solidly and would also serve as a stand. This red case fit the bill. My only suggestions would be to add a pocket on the right-hand side of the cover and to improve the tabs that fasten the device so that they don't stick out at all.
This cover was supposedly made for the 'Kindle Fire', but they must not have had one hany when they created the prototype. One of the speakers gets covered by the case when it is on. Also, I don't see why they need to charge $40- for 'pleather'. The quality and fit for the 'Kindle Fire' jives more with a 'street-buy' in Manhattan than a BB product.
I really like this case. It's designed so you can prop the Fire up and not have to hold it in your hands all the time. Very nice. The cover stays closed even after being propped open for a long time. It feels very nice. Looks good too!
When I bought my Kindle Fire, the only case that Best Buy had in stock was this one. It's pretty, and it's sturdy, so what's wrong with it? I think it must have been designed before anyone had a Fire in their hands, because no matter which direction the Fire faces, one speaker is completely block. Further, the case hangs over the front screen far enough that it can make pressing icons along the edge (such as for settings) difficult. This case will do in a pinch but it's annoying in the long hall.
Durable and prevents damage. I've put my Kindle in my bookback and have not had any issues as long as this cover was on. I just wish it had a latch so that it stayed closed.
This case protects well, easy to take Kindle out of when I don't want to use the case,and the case has different positions that it can be used in, making it very versatile.
It's compact, doesn't take up much more room than the Fire. Seems durable and will protect Fire. I like the magnetic closure. I just wish it had a slot for a stylus.
If the jacket had an outside pocket it would be perfect.
This is a really good cover for a Kindle Fire. It is well made and nice looking. Well worth the money. What I don't like about it is that the Kindle Fire does not always stand up in the cover the way that it should. It's annoying but not really a big deal.
Overall, it's a very good cover. I gave it 4 stars instead of five because the middle incline position slides down and is basically non-existant. It's also difficult to get it to stand up as well. I also don't like that it's such a generic cover. In terms of how it protects the e-reader though, it's top notch. It snugs in around the outside edges of the e-reader so that it is "framed" on the lower half. It also has the magnetic cover - they are small magnets in the lower corners where the cover folds over, but they do work. It's great at protecting it in my purse! It's the only one I found like that. most of the other ones simply have a piece of elastic that comes up over the corners with the cover that just folds over. The elastic didn't look very durable and my e-reader slid around in it when I was trying them out in the store. Now if they could make this one with a great design on the cover of it that would be awesome!
I could tell when I looked at this case in the store that it wasn't everything I wanted in a case, but it was on sale and there wasn't too much else available at the time. Overall, still glad I bought it and haven't found the perfect replacement yet. Good: very solid, good padding. A couple days after buying I was sitting on a bar stool and my Kindle Fire took a hard fall from about 4 feet. I could tell as it hit the floor that the case saved it. Yep! So-so: One speaker is covered, but it really doesn't bother me. Bad: The material that keeps the Kindle in place is too wide at the bottom (landscape mode). It covers the screen just enough to be a pain. Not awful, but instead of an easy push I have to be deliberate about squeezing my finger under the material. If they would have shaved 1 or 2 millimeters off it would be perfect. Overall, pretty good, but for the price I expected the sizing to be better.
I've got a thing for "red" so I was glad this was on sale for $29.99. Nice durable case thus far and seems to be of quality. My only gripe is not really one regarding the case itself but rather of what i want in a case. I like the "folding cover" so that I can prop it up but it is flexible and doesn't fold in back as cleanly as I'd like. I'll still use it since i know my Fire will be protected though.
The Quality is great. Thick, high quality materials. Can be used in many configurations (not just the couple that are illustrated on the package). The cover does cover the part of the screen where you go back/go to the homepage. This can be remedied by simply turning the screen over (assuming it is unlocked). One bigger problem is that one of the two speakers is completely covered by the case. This is a pretty significant design flaw in that the speakers are not that loud to begin with. I love this case, but it appears it was rushed out simply based on the dimensions of the product and not the product itself.
The Inline Jacket offers good protection for your Kindle with its sturdy exterior while the soft interior cushions the screen nicely and protects against scratches (if you don't already have a screen cover on the device). The magnets within the Jacket make sure it stays closed and also help to prop the device up without falling down when in use. However, there is an area on the cover that must be constantly folded when the device is set to sit upright which over time may begin to wear, but with a lifetime warranty on the product I would expect if this became an issue for the product to be replaced. Another downside might be the price which is a little more than it should be but very comparable to similar products available. Overall though I would recommend at least considering this product.
This case is fantastic! It fits the fire like a glove. It is sleek and professional looking. I'm just sad they sold out so quickly since I need one for my mom, too.
This case is both highly functional and comfortable in the hand. Folds like iPad cover to make an easy stand. Also has other ways to fold to make different angles. I have seen nothing better.
This is nice to use for reading books, you are able to carry around hundreds of books at one time. There is a glare on the screen, not like the original kindle which have no glare. Also you can use for internet only if you have WIFI, no 3G or 4G.
Very pleased with my kindle fire cover....However, my Kindle Fire does not hold a charge nearly as long as advertised....
We use it all the time as a stand for the Kindle. We can carry it around and never worry about bumping or damaging the Kindle.
My Kindle fits snug inside and I like the bendable cover for ease of viewing.
Protects the Kindle from scratches and damage. Just make everyone gets a cover for your Kindle
All around great cover, stylish and functional!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Love the Kindle Fire case. It totally protects the KF from any damage due to drops. Very durable and priced right. Well worth buying!!!
alls well so far,after a broken kindle,screen replaced not working and purchased another kindle ..all over around 450.00 for everything..
Case does everything it is supposed to, mainly protecting my Kindle Fire! Nice quality to it and I like that you can make it into a prop stand, works great.
This was exactly what I wanted for my kindle fire. I wanted a cover for protection, and something that would stand it up hands free when I needed it. I can watch movies or read a recipe, no problem. I throw it in my purse with everything else in there, and I'm not always gentle in how I throw my purse around, So I wanted good protection. This product does everything it says. I highly recomend it. Not a bad price either, and well worth it to protect your notebook.
I bought this for use with a Samsung Galaxy 7.0plus and it works just fine. There weren't any cases in the store for the 7.0plus so I purchased this case that is packaged for the Kindle Fire. The dimensions of the 7.0plus are almost identical to the Fire. The case is well made and it's holding up fine. The "stand" functionality works really well.
I love this case for my Kindle Fire. It's perfect for setting up my Fire on the desk while I'm eating lunch, and the elastic band that holds the case closed is easily reversible to hold the case open. While I do miss having pockets inside the case, as I have on the one for my NOOK, the other features of this case more than make up for it.
I love this case, very soft inside and durable outside with a nice grip to it. its a very simple case that does everything i need. i looked a long time for a case that wouldnt scratch my kindle and would still hold it securely, this hits both.
Best product to protect Kindle fire and not lose functionality. Other cases cover the loudspeakers with their elastic straps and reduce sound quality.
Long story short, kindle fell from a car after forgetting it was on top of the car. After retracing our drive, we saw the case in the road. The Kindle is still alive and well after its fall. It was not run over, but still, the screen was perfectly fine, only a minor scratch on the corner of the device's plastic casing. Kindle still works like a charm
Cost for item too high, little protection for impact due to dropping or being knocked over..
Since I carry my Kindle everywhere I go, a durable case is a must. This case really accents the beauty of the new Fire, also!!
This cover is thick and sturdy and fits the kindle perfectly. My wife uses it to position the kindle to set up on the counter so she can read recipes as she cooks.
This product works well if you are looking for a cover that gives some protection and still is easy to use & not in the way while using your Kindle Fire. It does protrect the front and back of the Kindle. It is like the cover for a hardcover book. The cover on the front and back with the Kindle fire, rather than paper pages, between the two hard covers. But it is better than a hardcover book in that the front cover folds back against the back cover when fully open and makes the Kindle easy to hold on to and balance while reading. The Kindle is held in place by elastic bands in each corner. I have never had any kind of problem with it coming loose. About Best Buy - I know this product is very good. However, Best Buy tends to remove reviews that show low ratings. I will give them the benefit of the doubt though. In my experience, the ones they remove usually are meaningless with such comments as, "Not what I wanted so I'll rate it only one star," Reviews should say why it is good or bad and why you liked it or didn't. If they don't they should be removed.
I love this case - slim and flexible. Holds the Fire firmly in place - the cover folds back and can be held in place with an elastic band when you want to read - and holds the case closed when not in use. I purchased the case with the blue lining, as it's all that was available at my local Best Buy. Great case all around!
This was recommended and has been all it was designed to do.
Really like the durability and convenience and the access to my Kindle as well as being able to convert to a stand and reverse to a hardback. Really great value too.
Excellent product. Well designed .Very good quality !
This was made for the Amazon Kindle Fire ereader but perfectly fits my Google/Asus Nexus 7 . It protects the device when closed and strapped yet can be folded to stand "landscape" style for hands free watching.
The gentleman who sold us the whole bundle mislead us completely on it. When we returned the Kindle Fire we didn't need the cover thing.
We really enjoy this carrying case for our kindle. We just returned from a trip to florida and the case did its job.
Very nice case that allows viewing in horizontal or vertical position. Handy stylus holder on the back. Needs more color choices.
Very nice and suggest it to anyone who buys a kindle fire!
Looks Great -- very flexible, easy going from horizontal to vertical. Really protects the Kindle while in my tote-bag. I love it!
If you have a Kindle Fire, this is a must-have. It has great protection, not heavy, movability to make a "stand", it seems very durable. I am so glad to have found this product. Worth every penny! Have already suggested it to friends and they are happy they got it also.
This is not the case for you if you want it to open like a book; however, the positioning is excellent! A really great purchase.
Love the flexability. Works great both vertical and horizontal. Nice construction.
For the Daily Deal price, this case was what I was looking for at a great price. Picked it up at the Best Buy store the day I ordered it online. Wonderful!
I like having the kindle protected and the stand is great for travel and bedtime reading.
Great case for the Kindle. Very useful and my stylus fits perfectly in the little elastic space on the back. Only complaint is that there is not a hole on the top of it so you do not have to unplug it to use the band to keep it closed (does that even make sense? )
Kindle snaps securely in place. The case cover rotates so you can adjust the standing position to your liking. I use the vertical position most since I do alot of reading. However, the case easily converts to a horizontal stand for video viewing and so on.
I really didn't want to pay $40 for a case, but the guy at Best Buy assured me this was the best one. I am totally happy. Kindle snaps in just perfectly, without a bulky case overlapping the top of the Kindle. LOVE the swivel feature. Very sturdy stand - have used on table, lap, even armchair with no problems. When holding Kindle instead of using stand, I place my fingers in the hole in the swivel mechanism for steadiness. (Hope that makes sense!) Alao has a place on back to store stylus, but instead I find it handy for holding reading glasses.
The Versavu is by far the best cover/stand out there for the Kindle Fire. The price was right, quality build (stitching, materials, design) and the only cover that allowed use of KF in any position and not fall over when using the touch screen! The 360 degree rotation feature is just what the Dr. ordered. The KF as well as internet sites, apps, and widgets have different default screen orientations ie. Angry Birds' orientation was always upside down, which meant I had to remove KF from cover and replace it so as to view AB the proper way. Not Any More! Love this feature! Versavu's soft yet solid construction protect the KF on all sides and does not block speakers,function switches or light meter. All in all a great cover at a reasonable price.
Bought this case because my hands got tired of holding the Kindle. The first case of a different style required hands-on. LOVE to read on the kindle. Backlit pages are so much easier than paper pages. Love not having to carry books around. My grandson doesn't like the case on for some games that require tilting/moving the Kindle. Overall I do like it and am thinking about buying one for my elderly mother.
I love it and would recommend it to anyone with a Kindle Fire. They should make it in colors, but I wouldn't pay for another one now at $45.
I tested a number of products before deciding on this one. The Targus Versavu THZ169US case is a perfect fit for the Kindle Fire and keeps the product protected and secure. The 360 degree rotating stand design allows the product to be positioned vertically and horizontally and in three different angles, which offers stability and comfort for hours of reading, web, video, and gaming enjoyment.
Case works well for the Kindle. Durable and gives great protection.
the warranty is why i bought it.I have not had to use it
got a come-to-jesus speech from best buy girl about" how critical" this was & "protect the screen" & "extend the life" & "yada-yada." who really knows? well...i guess someone does but not me... regardless, i said ok, but then they tried to advocate paying who knows how much extra to install it for me..."if you mess up it's ruined"... scare tactics for plastic? really? that's where we're at. my husb is not esp careful w such things historically and he put it on no problem. not so hard. bestbuy scare-tactics be damned.
Paid $29 for the product, then screwed it up applying it. There was already a dust particle in it when i opened the package. Had to return it and pay to have a new one installed...another $15!! I don't know if I want to pay for one for another kindle i plan to buy for my mother!
Great screen protector. It does not look like one is even on it. I paid to have Best Buy put it on. It looked difficult to put on.
I actually paid to have someone at the store apply it. He had trouble with the first one so gave me another. After 48 hours it still had tons of big bubbles. Had to return to the store and they had someone else apply another one and that one has been fine. I would recommend but unless you are used to applying them don't do it yourself.
I like Zagg products. I think they make great screen protectors.
I love the ZAGG InvisibleSHIELD becausemit keeps my Kindel Free from Scratches
Screen protectors are never easy to install, so was hesitant with a "wet" installation. Seemed to work fine except for a few tiny air bubbles. Would rather have them than a scratch on my new Kindle Fire.
Pain in the but to install. Warranty requires you to pay another 6 dollars for shipping us postal snail mail. If you are buying this and use geek squad you're nearly at 50 dollars for a piece of plastic film. For that price you can have a square trade 2 year warranty that will replace the entire unit if anything at all happens to it. Best buy, 15 dollars to install--Please! That is insane, verizon will apply protective coatings to phones and tablets for free no questions--that is service. I know the mark-up is huge on these so how about some customer service. I've spent 4000 dollars this year in your stores and can't get you to install a plastic film.
I like this thing. It is very clear so that I don't even notice that it's on my Kindle Fire.
Screen protector had "cloudy" areas and small bubbles that did not disappear, Had to have cover emoved and replaced with another brand screen protectoe
Installed in about 10 minutes. If you read the instructions it is a no-brainer. Looks good and does drastically reduce outside glare on the screen. Have had it installed for about a month and it seems to be collecting small scratches.
I wouldn't be without it. Screen needs protection but I find the film blurs the display. It was easy to apply if you follow the very clear instructions. That is the biggest key. I think it was a little expensive for one sheet. It will be a long time before I replace it. Maybe by then it will be improved. It's like the screen saver on my Droid. Necessary but a little lacking.
Since the type size on the instructions was so small as well as confusing I took my Kindle back to Best Buy. A very nice young man working for them put it on for me. Thank you!!
The Zagg product is awesome. Yes a little tricky too install but given you relax and give yourself time its not that hard to do. Don't be intimidated! A plus its not a one time and fail chance. Geek Squad... that's where the one person failed. You cant have the Geek Squad install a battery. Review; The Zagg HD screen protector is what it claims too be. The price, remember the cost of the item your protecting. Geek Squad, well lets just say theirs a reason why most, not all work at a Best Buy.
We have only had our Kindle Fire for three days. On the second day, we went to Best Buy to purchase a screen protector, and paid the Geek Squad $15 to install it for us. After waiting the recommended 24 hours to use the device again, we noticed that our screen was DAMAGED! I can't believe the lack of respect the Geek Squad has shown our product. There is a huge portion of the screen with bright streaks running across it now. Doing it yourself may be tricky, but at least you're not likely to break your device.
This is a great cover for the money and works well with the Kindlefire
If you need a case for the Nexus 7 this one works nicely. The case can be opened and the cover folds into a nice triangle hand grip for reading. You can also fold back and forth a kick stand for landscape. The stylist loop is already showing elastic failure after about two months of daily use. But the case while having picked up a stain or two is standing up to the use. Protects your tablet well and much better than any other 7 cover I have seen so far.
It works, that's about all. Color is nice, clasp not so good
Love love this case! I recently gave my Galaxy Tab 10. inch to my daughter and purchased the 7. inch (so I wouldn't have to carry such a huge purse!) but I was disappointed to see there aren't many assessories for it. I gave a couple cases, which were made for the kindle fire, a try and I decided on this one. It's not bulky, the outside is smooth and the clasp is really neat. The four elastic straps on the inside hold it snugly and non-skid material is great for protecting the screen. I am very happy with my purchase.
This is a very nice case that feels good in your hand and fits the Kindle Fire like a glove. It has a nice suede feel to the texture of the interior liner. A magnetic closure would make this a 5 star case since there is nothing to hold the flap closed but your hand when you carry it. I'm concerned that the flap won't stay in place and may become damaged if I toss it into a tote bag, but I haven't tried that yet.
I love how it covers my Kindle Fire and how this cover feels in my hands. It is so easy to use and hold. It also is a lovely color and design.
I purchased this for my Kindle Fire. It is soft to the touch but it is strong enough to protect my Kindle.
It fits very well and protects my Kindle Fire from scratches and bumps!
This is the best Kindle case I never have, feel like leather and excellent construction.
I have only had it for a month, so don't know how it will last. But, it is padded enough to be protective, comfortable to use and looks great.
Works well would like to have different color options.
It fits perfectly. It props the Fire up to adjustable positions. It is sturdy and well made.
I needed a "stand" & protective case for my new Kindle Fire... Really like this duo stand / case - sturdy!
This was the best cover for the Kindle Fire. I love it. It looks nice and professional and protects my Kindle perfectly. The only downside to this item is the price. It could be a little cheaper for those on a budget and looking for other case options besides the one that has an elastic holding the corners to secure the kindle in place.
I leave it in this holder all the time. I use the holder to hold my Kindle while I read.
Well designed and constructed case, convenient to use in all arrangements, should last until the Fire becomes obsolete. Value is average because all the accessories anyone sells for Kindles, Nooks, and the like (let alone i-anything) are ridiculously overpriced.
I compared about 15 different cases before choosing this one for my Kindle Fire. This one met all my criteria, which were 1) protects the Kindle both while transporting it and when using it, 2) doesn't interfere with any of the Kindle's features (like blocking a power button or headphone jack), 3) looks cool. :-) This case cradles the Kindle Fire during use and protects it without seeming to smother it. The fit is perfectly snug, and the case closes and stays closed when it is supposed to. This case was above my intended price point, but the $30 cases were so inferior that this one fairly easily coerced me to break my budget.
I really do like this case. I was one of the first customers to get my hands on one when they came in. This case has a very sophisticated look and is well made. The front is soft while the back is ridgid. Also, the liner is super soft. The one thing I don't care for is the snap hook. When it is folded back on itself it is hard to hold in your right hand as the hook is directly behind it. Otherwise I love this case and would definetly recommend.
I enjoy my Kindle Fire, it has everything I want in one small easy to carry case, I have everything with me whenever I want to take it with me, which is all the time, when waiting at the doctors, or any appointment that I have to wait, it makes the wait, faster and easier, It is one of the best electronic items I have bought.
This cover/holder for the Kindle Fire is alright. However, when I try to stand the Kindle on edge with the grooves in the cover, it does not hold.
Rocketfish(TM) MY WAY Case is a good for Kindle Fire;however, that the band becomes loses up after a few uses.
GOT THIS AT BEST BUY BECAUSE THEY DIDNT HAVE ANY OTHER CASES FOR MY GALAXY TAB. I LIKE TO USE THE FOLDING COVER TO MAKE IT EASIER TO VIEW MOVIES. THIS CASE IS A GUD BUY FOR THE PRICE. I USE MY GALAXY TAB AT WORK AND IT IS LESS NOTICABLE TO MY BOSS IF I HAVE IT IN THIS CASE BECAUSE IT LOOKS LIKE A BOOK COVER. LOL I AM HAPPY THAT I PURCHASED IT. THE ONLY THING THAT I THINK WOULD PROTECT THE TAB ALOT MORE IS A ZIPPER, BECAUSE I LIKE TO PROTECT THE SIDES OF MY TAB ESPECIALLY THE PART WHERE THE CHARGER CABLE IS INSERTED TO KEEP IT DUST FREE. CANT WAIT TO TAKE THIS OUT OF TOWN WITH ME ON MY TRIP THIS SUMMER!!!!!!!
This was for my wifre's Kindle Fire. I would not have chosen this for mine, but she likes it and it was reasonably priced.
I really enjoy this cover. It protects and allows me the opportunity for hands-free reading enjoyment if my hands get tired of holding it.
Protects your Tablet from scratches. East to carry in your purse or briefcase.
This product works if you're mainly utilizing the kindle fire around the house or for light travel. The unit is solid, has a nice nylon backing and the colored book straps make the feel of the case strong. The unit stays clean and keeps dust from accumulating around the edges of the screen. I would recommend this product for anyone who uses their kindle fire in the house, in the office or takes it with them on occasion around town to appointments.
While inexpensive, this cover works great and protects my Kindle Fire. Before I had the cover, I would accidentally hit the power button. Now that never happens.
this cover is compact, easy to open and close, and can be used as a stand.
I received my Kindle Fire and immediately bought this case to go along with it. The different colored bans add some personality to this otherwise bland case and allow for easy identification of Kindles. I have dropped my Kindle in this case several times and have yet to suffer any problems. I would recommend this anyone who thinks they may drop their Kindle, or people who have more than one Kindle in their household.
This is really a nice little case, Lots of padding. I just wish these had the option to stand the Fire up vertically, as well as horizontally...that would make it perfect!
Great in the US perfect size Apps don't work in south america.
I love this cover... it's durable and able to be customized with the three different color straps that were provided. The only thing that's a little weird about it is the viewing angles when you prop it up. I'm sure it's pretty uniform across all cases like this, but I found it a little hard to see at the angles provided. Overall wonderful case and great value for the price I paid.
Fits the Kindle Fire perfectly. Well made nylon outer cover. Soft inner lining to protect my Kindle. Has a small pocket for the stylus. Props up for horozontal viewing. Elastic band is decorative and functional. I use it to hold my kindle to my music stand to read the sheet music I have entered in my Kindle. Lots to like about this cover. Reasonable price for the protection it gives.
I love this product for many reasons. It protects my Kindle Fire and offers convertibility into a stand with multiple viewing positions which is great for hands-free reading. My husband also has this identical product so having the option of 3 different colored straps is great. It makes identifying my own Kindle Fire a breeze!!
I purchased two of these for my family's two Kindle Fires. They fit well and I enjoyed the color selection of the strap to help identify both Kindle Fires. the build in stand also works well. It is desinged and built well. No damage after two months of use and packing it in my backpack while traveling (flying).
Love it! It allows me to rest my Kindle Fire on my knee for hands-free reading and I love that it opens like a book and is easy to hold. It protects my Kindle from accidental falls (only happened once) and its non-slip surface allows me to set it on the arm of the couch without worrying. I definitely recommend this product and in fact bought one for my daugher-in-law for Christmas after she bought me mine for my December birthday.
This is a great protector for your Kindle Fire. I bought two of these actually. One for my Kindle and the other one to carry hot dogs. No joke. It has the perfect thickness to just barely grip the dog so it does not fall out. It holds roughly 8 hot dogs or 1 Kindle Fire. How cool is that!
I looked at alot of cases, most priced at around $40 instead of $25 like this one. This one has been working very well for our needs, and it props up the Kindle Fire with 3 different angles well. Would recommend to friends and family or anyone with a Kindle Fire, Cheers
Fits my Kindle Fire well. I like the protection it gives.
After looking at all the cases and prices for the Kindle Fire on Amazon, eBay, and Best Buy I decided to go with this one. For the price it is a great case. All functions of the Fire are accessible without having to remove from the case. You can leave the Fire in the case and turn on its side to prop up which is a nice touch for watching videos on Netflix or YouTube. The sides of the Fire are exposed, but unless you are very clumsy or throw the Fire around I doubt you will even scratch it. The color straps are a nice touch.
This was the only case available at Best Buy when I bought the Kindle Fire over Christmas. It does a good job in protection and is easy to use, giving an option to use it as a stand as well when viewing horizontally. A zipper could add a little more protection.
My kindle fire Rocketfish Case is awesome and perfect for my kindle fire...
I bought one of the more expensive ones and ended up taking it back and getting this one instead. This one doesn't have corners that cover up the keyboard like the other one and it gives you a really good position for typing. Plus the colored customizing tabs are a cool touch.
got the kindle fire for my wife for christmas along with this case. case looks good and protects the kindle well. the case does not enclose the whole kindle,sides are exposed, but then again you can charge the fire without opening or removing the fire from the case. the three straps are a nice touch and they keep the cover closed. i tried buying a cover on amazon, but the cover would not close wilth the fire in the case.
Covers made for the Samsung Galaxy Tab 7 Plus haven't hit the stores yet so I tried this case for the Kindle Fire. It's a good fit and it keeps the profile slim (a major selling point of the Galaxy Tab series) though there is no cut out for the back camera. Tab owners will want to stretch out the strap that touches the power button so continuous pressure is not applied. This is a light cover that looks fairly decent. It's not a hard cover so if you're rough with your stuff, you may want to look elsewhere. The pictures above don't show that you can fold the cover so that the screen is propped up at an almost 90 degree angle in landscape mode. The price is right on this item at $25 but I would've looked into a $40 black hard cover version for my Tab if they were available.
Great product. Easy to install and keeps my e-reader protected.
If you plan to use your tablet primarily to watch movies, the easel setup is very nice. If you prefer to hold the tablet in your hand when you're using it, this case is awkward. There are better solutions out there.
The only problem I see with this cover is on my Samsung Tablet 7.0 the top left securing strap goes directly over the on/off switch and holding it down so essentially you can use only 3 of the 4 straps.
I bought a LENEVO 7" tablet and needed to get something to protect it while at work but didn't want to spend a large sum....you had this cover designed for a Kindal that fit and it was perfectly priced.
It is good that there are 3 bands as they stretch out fast. Like stand feature. Sets up nicely on a desk.
Works out great. Purchased with my rewards certificate which helped to offset the costs.
I wouldn't suggest this case for a child. It is not real durable and the elastic corners do not hold the Kindle in place very well. It is nice that you can use the product as a stand as well as a carrying case.
Does the job and fits perfectly for my nexus 7. Comes with 3 color bands and is moderately priced.
Would buy again for the price and protection that this cover provides the Kindle Fire. Wife loves the color to make it stand out from all other black/gray covers for most devices. Only issue that some may have is that the black velcro, stretchy band that keeps the cover closed comes completely off in order to use the device. Possibility for some less careful folks or those with kids to lose it. Other than that, great buy!!!
I purchased this product, but it did not fit my e-Reader very well. Although the website said you carried covers for my particular e-Reader, the store did not stock this particular cover, and I was informed you do not actually carry the particular cover I needed.
I picked one of these up at the local Best Buy store last night after looking at different options online. I am waiting on a much more expensive Portenzo case for my Kindle Fire but thus far I have been disillusioned with their customer service and have a hunch the finished product will not meet and/or exceed my expectations. This case, then, is intended to be an insurance policy in case the Portenzo is a dud. For the money, this is an excellent product. This case, along with the Belkin Folio stand case, were really the only two options I was considering, but the Belkin is $15 more and in my opinion doesn't provide enough in the way of additional panache or features to justify the higher price tag. The Belkin is made of leather on the outside, while the Rocketfish is not, but that doesn't matter to me. Both have nice, soft interiors...the Rocketfish looks more plush with a suede-like microfiber cloth material on both sides of the pad on which the Kindle Fire mounts, as well as on the inside of the front flap. The stand on the case works as it should, is stable and provides three different positions for viewing the Kindle Fire. It looks good when closed and the elastic strap is secure. The system that mounts the Kindle Fire to the case is snug and I feel very confident the device won't slip out accidentally. I was initially concerned with the red color shown on the website, but thankfully it's not nearly as vivid in person. All in all, it's a nice case for the Fire and it may even be good enough to take on a more expensive competitor and come out smelling like a rose...kind of like the Fire itself.
No problems. Is made with quality. Looks like it should stand up well to use.
I have really enjoyed using this case with my Kindle Fire. It provides great protection from many other items in my large duffle purse. I have enjoyed using the Kindle Fire in this case both upright and sideways using the built-in stand on the flap. The only drawback is the velcro strap gets in the way sometimes when the case is being used as a stand. I have to take off the strap completely, and I am afraid I will lose it.
I am happy with it for the most part. It is easy to take out when I want to hook it to the keyboard.
I washed my hands, cleaned the face of my Kindle Fire, applied the gunk, and tried to get the *&^$^* thing to stick onto the face plate. All I can say, is pay a few more bucks, and have the salesperson who sold you the protector install it. That's what I did for the second time.
Followed instructions step by step. Product didn't adhere and left film on Kindle screen. Ultimately removed and just relying on case to protect screen.
Seems to hinder ability of my touch to be transferred to the screen so often i have to really press hard to execute a command. However it does seem to protect the screen from scratches and finger prints.
This was an absolute waste of money. I followed the instructions to the letter and the screen protector still didn't go on right. I really wish the people at Best Buy would've told me difficult it was to install, then maybe I would've paid the extra to have them do it in the store. It's very hard to use my Kindle now because the protector has a rubbery feel to it, so my finger is constantly sticking to the screen. Don't wasted your money on this. However, if you do feel it necessary to buy a screen protector, pay the extra to have them do it and save yourself the headache.
When I opened the package the liquid bottle was leaking and the contents within the package were all wet and not usable. I did not have time to go back to the store to return the product so I was stuck with this non usable item.
I love it, it is easier to keep clean and there is no glare.
I spent a lot of money on this to protect my wife's new Kindle. Unfortunately, even carefully following instructions and taking great care, we could not get the shield in place without bubbles and bumps. Might as well have thrown the $25.00 out the window...
Had a hard time install first time. had to buy another one and it finaly worked. First one got something on the sticky side. Bubbles are hard to get out.
Difficult to install and though it is made for the Kindle Fire, it doesn't really fit.
It's hard to beat lifetime screen protection for $29.99.
This product works as advertised. It is complicated to install.
I thought this would be very hard to install after the store clerk said they have special techs who went to training school to learn how to install these; reason for the store convience charge to put this on for it's customers I guess. I followed the instructions and had no trouble installing this. Looks great,no air bubbles. I recommed that you read all of the instructions 1st though, so you know what to expect.
The screen protector was so difficult to put on that I gave up.
Honestly... the $25 price tag threw me when i purchased this screen protector... & I wanted to make sure installation was right so I was a bit intimidated about ruining or applying it wrong... but installation was NOT that difficult.. just follow the simple directions. & you will LOVE it! It is durable. I would highly recommend & have actually purchased this brand protector for my touch screen blackberry too!
I love my kindle fire so far would recommend it to others and have
I purchased an Amazon Kindle for my wife for Christmas this year and decided to wait and let her choose the accessories. Knowing she would need a screen protector we went to BestBuy. We were surprised that this was the only brand they had in stock so there weren't any other options. We were also shocked to find out that for $25.00 there is only one cover in the package. I cleaned the screen and installed the cover which was easy with the provided cleaning cloth and spray. It has a lifetime warranty - so we will see how it holds up.
This is a terrible product of I just didn't know what I was doing. If you have ever put tinting on windows you know that you have to wet the surface fo the window and the tinting so it slides around so you can position it correctly, then you use a squeegee to press out all of the bubbles and excess water. I bought this for my new Kindle Fire. First of all I don't think that water and electronic devices mix, but I followed the directions and when I was finished, I had so many bubbles that I could not get rid of and the display was blurry and distorted. Decided to go without any protector if this type of product is the only option availble for screen protection for the Kindle. Don't waste your money!
The shield is a bit tricky to install properly, but once you get it on, it is bulletproof. The cost is a bit high, but you get what you pay for. The shield seems to be virtually scratch proof and very easy to clean up smudges, fingerprints, etc. It also does not really affect the ability to see the screen (i.e. very low glare issues) -- overall a great product - worth the money - way better than cheaper imitations.
awful product - terrible. waste of money. Wouldnt recommend it to an enemy.
This screen for my Kindle Fire is well worth the money. It was very easy to put on and has helped tremendously with keeping the Kindle clean.
The first time my 2 year old scribbled all over my kindle with black marker I knew it was a good purchase. It came right off with a wipe. Be very careful and follow the directions exactly when installing. It is a little tricky, but no more tricky than any other screen protector.
This was way over priced for the quality. It was also very difficult to install and could not get all of the air bubbles out from under the film. I would not recommend it.
I could understand the issues with this product IF I had installed it myself. The ONLY reason why I had the Geek Squad install it was because they were only charging $5.00 so I figured it was worth it... So, I have them "professionally" install it, and listened carefully when they told me that it would be best if I waited 6- 8 hours before I used it to let the product cure on the Kindle. Okay. Done. The next day, I let my son use it and little bubbles appear all over it. I squeezed them out carefully with an LCD screen cloth. They keep re-appearing, no matter what, even if all I'm doing is read a book. I'm going to ask for my money back as this product is the worst screen cover I've ever used. Unbelievably bad. Maybe it was just a bad batch and the chemicals were off that day, but this thing looks like I installed it myself in a sandstorm.
This is the third device for which I've purchased Invisible Shield. (A Samsung Instinct and HTC EVO being my previous ones.) Even then, it took me a couple of attempts to get it on my Kindle. It's not the easiest thing to install, even if you've had some past experience. I've found that the trick is to use enough of the spray solution to make the film easy to manipulate on the screen and get it in the right position. I consider this my first "perfect" install of an Invisible Shield. (I had to buy three before I got it right on my Instinct and two for my EVO.) That said, I keep coming back to Invisible Shield because it's an outstanding product once you get it installed. The protection's great and I really like the tactile feel of the material on my touch screen.
This Kindle Fire screen protector came with spray solution. It was easy to install on the Fire. I would highly recommend this brand.
At first, my primary thought was, "Great, a "new" screen protector for another device." At the time, Best Buy had a special which included Geek Squad installation with the purchase of the Zagg shield. So, for $24.99, I received the shield and installation for my new Kindle Fire. Akin to others who posted their review, I too thought the installation would not be a problem but since Geek squad installation was included, I let them take care of it. The Zagg shield is a much better quality screen protector than other brands for your cell phone. However, I will purchase a Zagg shield for my iPhone. If you have the opportinuty or can obtain the Geek Squad installation special, PLEASE have them do it!! My Kindle Fire looks fabulous. It will be well worth it, and you will be satisfied!!!
Excellent product. Keeps finger prints and smudges away.
this product was way too complicated to try to use - the minute you get one piece of lint or fuzz on it, it is useless - you get one chance to get it right, and if it is not perfect, you've just thrown away $25. It did not go well when I tried to adhere this to my Kindle Fire, and I had to throw it out. No second cover to try again. I felt this was a waste of money, and not remotely easy to install.
Have it on Kindle Fire. Easy to install, follow simple instructions. A bit expensive compared to other places to purchase.
I was excited to have purchased this screen cover for my Kindle. I usually don't need one for my electronics, I am pretty good about keeping screens scratch free but I thought what the hell I want to keep it perfect. Installation wasn't too bad if you have patience. I had to remove the first install as it was crooked. Second time around was just about perfect but I held it in my hand while I cleaned off the screen for round 2. In that time a couple of small hairs stuck to the protector. I only noticed them once it was installed and dried. I was reading and went to brush them away but they didn't move. Even the smallest crumb or speck of anything will leave a bump in the film. For me it drives me nuts. I will be removing the screen protector and trying to get the hair and the speck out and hopefully it will be perfect afterwards. If not it will be taken off and trashed. Not sure if I could return or not. If it is perfectly installed, it is great. Nice feel, would need a knife to get through the film. Will update when I remove and reinstall again. For me the geek squad install for $15 is a rip-off. If it was $5 bucks, sure.
Bought this for my new Kindle Fire. Pro: -Well I guess the screen is very well protected. That is about it. Cons: -Very hard to install. - Film is very thick and sticky. The exact opposite of what I was looking for in a screen protector. - Very expensive.
I bought this knowing that as a screen protector, installation would be tricky. The instructions were easy to follow. The included cleaning cloth, rubber squeegee and spray were a nice addition for installing the screen protector. Everything went according to plan. I washed my hands, cleaned my screen (not even a speck of dust or smudge was observed), and used the included spray to wet my fingers and the plastic screen protector. I didn't even have issues with bubbles being hard to work out. The instructions said to let the protector sit for a day after installation. Well, that was the hardest part, being that I've only had the kindle for a week (I want to use it all the time). The next day I go to use my Kindle and everything looks great. No bubbles, screen protector is centered, following the directions made installation a snap. However, when I went to swipe the screen, the screen protector slid right off the Kindle. It didn't even act like it had adhered at all, on any part of the Kindle screen. If you're wondering if I put the correct side of the protector down, yes I did. There is only one way to install it so that the hole cut in the plastic protector lines up with a barely perceptible sensor in the top left of the Kindle Fire screen. So, yes, the protector had the correct edge laid down against the screen of the Kindle. Other reviews seem to give it high marks. I'm gong to have to give it a low mark. I'm taking it back and will have to decide on a refund or an exchange. I may get a refund and get a protector from somewhere else.
I had previously tried another screen protector (another brand) from another store and installed it myself. This had 2 problems (1) the material was too thick so the Kindle Fire was unresponsive to most of the taps. (2) since I installed it myself, there were lots of bubbles, even though I did my best to remove them. So I removed that screen protector and returned it for a refund. After reading these reviews, I decided to try this screen protector (Zagg invisible Shield) and have Best Buy install it. I watched the technician install it in front of me. He use a special liquid spray to coat the kindle screen on both sides of the screen protector, then apply it with a special squeegee to remove the sprayed fluid and any bubbles. So far, I'm VERY PLEASED. There are NO BUBBLES at all (so it looks beautiful) and the material is thin enough that the Kindle responds to all taps as though there is no shield. It takes 24-48 hrs for the screen protector to completely dry (though it feels dry to the touch long before). The technician said not to put the Kindle back into it's case until the 24-48 hrs are up and only to apply very light taps if it's used before that time is up. For me, it was worth spending the extra $14.99 to have the shield professionally installed by Best Buy because it's nearly impossible to remove all bubbles out if you try installing it yourself (I don't have the experience nor equipment to do it professionally) If I change my mind on anything after using the screen protector in the next months, I'll update this review.
I normally protect all my electronic devices with some screen protector. In the past, I preferred the sticky film protectors, but for the first time, I have tried the Zagg protectors, which usually require the solution to apply the film to the device. I actually paid the extra dollars for the Geek Squad to install it and they did a great job. It took about a day for the film to dry completely. While it is in the drying process, you will have difficulty using the device. Just know that it requires drying time. Unlike the other protectors, you can actually feel the thickness and protection with the Zagg film. I liked it so much that I installed a Zagg protector on my iPhone and iPad too.
Complete waste of money. Not only was it a pain to install, it still looked terrible after getting all the bubbles out and getting the alignment just right. I'm only giving it good scores on Durability and Protection because it sure looked like it would protect my screen, only at the cost of turning my slick new kindle into an eyesore. I have used screen protectors on my phone before and never had such issues. I gave it a chance to settle hoping it would look better over time. Alas, it did not, so I removed it. My leather case really gives me all the protection I need and I can easily wipe off fingerprints. Now seems like a pointless waste of money.
This protector went on okay. You have to work out the bubbles, as with any of these protectors. When I worked out the bubbles, the film stretched so I had to trim it to fit. It has already protected my screen from a scratch in the few weeks I've had it. Screen touch still works well. I think the Kindle Fire needs anti-glare so I wish I had purchased a screen protector that had anti-glare properties.
bought this yesterday and had it on my wife's kindle in about ten minutes. very easy to install. rated durability and protection as excellent, but that is only based on the research i have done on zagg products. i have a zagg screen protector on my cell phone for about a year and has protected the screen as promised. did have trouble finding it at a local best buy store, but finally did. most of the stores were sold out. i did try ordering another brand on amazon, but it was difficult to put on and could not eliminate the bubbles. the zagg is worth the extra money.
Love the case! The case opens all the way or can be folded as a stand while using the Kindle. The corners securely hold in the Kindle and a strap to keep the cover closed while not in use is easy to use. Have had my Kindle and case for 6 weeks and can't image not having this case to protect my Kindle.
Cover was well made and appears sturdy. Hold device well and doesn't feel like it will pop out once you get it into position. The four corner straps do use elastic bands which may wear out over time and stretch but seems like it should work for a long time. A little thick in one spot where cover is doubled to fold out as stand so it make it a bit bulky.
I would highly recommend for anyone who is purchasing the Kindle Fire.
got this for my son to go with his Fire -- he is very pleased with durability, protection and use. I agree with the others, though, it is a little high in price
I really like this leather case as I use my Fire almost daily. It has a snug fit, and feels very durable. My only complaint is that the grooved edges that were placed in the cover for to adjust the angle for hands free viewing leaves smudges on my screen protector. Otherwise, I really like the case and feel like it was the best fit for me.
I like the case OK for it's quality and design, though I think it's priced about $5-10 too high. Here's the problem: I decided to treat the leather with a water-based leather treatment (carnauba wax) and it bled black dye all over a towel I used to wipe off the excess! Not a little black, but it stained the towel completely black until I stopped an realized I was ruining a dish towel. My advice, is don't get the cover damp/humid and then place it on your carpet/upholstery. And yes, I realize a computer should generally not see any moisture, but buyers should be aware of this. Good quality leather goods should NEVER bleed their dye.
The only reason this review didn't garner a 5 star rating was because I feel that this product is slightly over-priced. Otherwise, it's an attractive case that snugly holds the Kindle Fire on all corners without interfering with the view of the screen. If you've had issues with accidentally hitting the power button located at the bottom of the tablet, this case should eliminate that problem. Especially cool is the fact that it converts to a stand that holds the tablet at multiple angles (on the horizontal), with a slip-proof surface.
Picked up this product today and was not what I expected. Can only use it in one direction. Not very good looking and I have concerns about the kindle falling out of the case. Would not be anchored well. I am returning this tomorrow.
Do yourself a favor and return this product and purchase the Marware case from amazon.com. This case isn't bad but for $29.99 you can have the best case available for the Kindle Fire. This case isn't bad if you have to have one now. But for $10 less, why settle for an inferrior case? Speaking of the Kindle Fire, why isn't Best Buy allowing anyone to post reviews on the Kindle Fire? It's a great product and I find it odd that Best Buy doesn't want anyone to submit a review on it. I'm guessing it's because of the sub par reviews? But in my mind the critics are wrong. Pick up a Kindle Fire and get a Marware case and you'll be very happy with your purchase.
Tried a few other cases - either too bulky or too flimsy. This one is well-made, compact, fits Kindle Fire perfectly, offers easy to use and multiple stand options. Overpriced, but they all are....would recommend this case.
This is a great case for my brand new Kindle Fire. I like the closed end on the outside that holds the device in place rather than at all 4 corners with thin elastic like some of the others I looked at. I like the stand as well. My only complaint about it is the smell. Can't really describe it. Just hope it eventually goes away.
Good quality product and love the color. It seems very durable and wipes clean. My 9 & 5 yr olds take Mom's kindle fire to play angry birds and hands are not always clean. The only weakness is sometimes when holding instead of using the incline to hold kindle while reading it falls out. Needs something to keep more secure in case.
Nice Color. I like that it can fold into a stand. Covers the Fire very well. The material allows you wipe off any stains if you get it dirty. The flap has magnets to keep the jacket closed and covered. Did I say it fits like a glove.
Great cover to start with, I couldn't find a cover any better when I was at the store.
i loved the color and the price was right and it is easy to clean when my grandson gets his sticky hands on it .
I bought this for my son's fire. He likes it okay. Although i shouldve bought him the nook.
This Kindle Fire cover is tough and there are so many ways to get the right position, even the most discerning reader will be comfortable. Love it!
Have had no problems with it. Like he assortment of colors, easy to handle.
I love the color and the way you can prop up the kindle for easy reading. The cover should have a strap to hold it closed tho. I had to purchase a narrow hairband to hold it shut but since it was too long I needed to tie a knot in it. It works but not as nice as if there were an attached strap. The strap is also nice for attaching onto it a stylus. That way they don't get misplaced.
Love it, great protection, easy to use compact nice
It helps protect the kindle. Plus it can only be used as a stand for watching movies.
I wanted this case for a long time, i have a toddler who constantly uses my kindle so i needed something that would protect from the occasional drop. And the best part it was on sale. I am very happy with my puchase.
Good sturdy cover with a good grip for the Kindle.
I purchased this item for my 10 year old son who used Christmas money to purchase the Kindle Fire. In fact, I wouldn't let him play with the Kindle until this arrived in the mail and we put it on! The cover is very thick and durable and I am sure that if we didn't have it- one drop on our tiled floor and the Kindle would have been gone. It's great insurance!
This is a sturdy product that seems to protect the Kindle Fire very well. I love that there is a replaceable screen... A couple of negatives that I can live with. It's a little bit heavy after awhile..so they should put a strap on the back to slip your hand through...also, my old kindle fire case doesn't fit anymore with the gumdrop case on...so I am in search of a case that will fit.
I am obsessed with my Kindle and save up for moths to get one. I found this case when searching for "indestructible" cases online and I am so happy I found it. It's def going to protect me kindle but is also looks really rad. It 's lightweight, but still with some heft to protect. It's comfortable to hold and rugged looking. I hope they come out with more colors soon.
Would highly recommend,for reader,and internet access where connection is possible.
Love this case for my Kindle Fire! This product is so soft and durable unlike many of the other products out there! Great price and I definitely recommend!
The Softest Most Durable Book Cover on the market. Its really great to hold my device and have a nice luxurious feel. Much better than the other covers I have tried with some of my other readers. Fantastic! WIsh my wife's IPAD cover was as nice!
While this was made for the Kindle Fire, I use it for my new Google Nexus tablet. It fits tightly. There are no similar products for the Nexus yet, but this jacket works just great.
love the durabily of the cover and protection for the kindle fire
Says 2.1 amps on package, but it's clearly much less than that. My 4g phone needs nearly an amp to charge, and on most 500-750 milliamp USB power supplies it will not pick up a charge. The phone manufacturer provides a 1.0 amp charger that can do the job, but this charger is worse than some of the cheaper units I have tried. My guess is that it only puts out about .5 amp -- the phone discharges slowly while plugged into it.
Works perfectly for the tablets it is intended for. Don't listen to the other review where the reviewer tried to use it for a non supported item.
Yes it says it will work with Apple iPhone - but with Blackberry in hand the uneducated Best Buy Salesperson GUARENTEED this charger will work with the Blackberry --- Save yourself the return -- It does NOT work with any other product than listed on the box. Another uninformed Best Buy employee!
It was worth the money, but did not stick all the way across the Kindle. Has 2 so worth the deal.
would've liked it better for $15 rather than the $25 or whatever it was, but i got it as gift for husb w/ a kindle fire. he's happy. goodnuf
Great cover. It locks easy and hold in the Kindle Fire.
I am very pleased with the quality of this product. Durable leather is smooth grain on the outside and soft suede inside. Offers great protection with the look and feel of a hardbound book.
It is great for the Kindle Fire fit it perfect , and i'm very happy with the product . And if you are thinking about getting one , all I can say is Do It .
Does a great job of protecting my Kindle Fire and is alo very stylish.
The case itself is of excellent quality & protects well. The folding feature that allows you to use it as a stand is also excellent. The only negative is that it's a little bulky.
Provides excellent protection for Kindle Fire and is sturdy and attractive. Cost was reasonable. Would like to see a cover that included a "pouch" at the closed end that you could slide a stylus into..
I really like the feel of this cover, so many covers have a strange fabric that I can't stand to touch. The incline is great for watching movies
The quality of the cover is great. I am disappointed that their is no dedicated pocket or sleeve for the stylus pen. Im using the M-Edge label sewed inside the incline pocket. The only problem with using the label it interferes with closing the sleeve.
My two son's purchased their own Kindle Fires. We then wanted to treat them to cases to protect them. I shopped around and could not find anything appropriate for a 7 and 5 year old that was cost effective. We found these bold fantastic cases for a great price! They have a rubber like texture so they will not slide off a table. Easy to wipe and keep clean ! Its a deffinite buy if you need something sturdy for a child to use !
I love this case for my Kindle Fire! I have been very pleased with it!!
I really like this. It is easy to put on my Kindle Fire and it is still easy to use my Kindle Fire and hold it. Great product.
I wish I had one sooner for my kindle fire cuz its great protection for the screen as well as the whole device! Once I saw how well my sons iPod touch was protected I figured I couldn't afford not to get one
I cannot imagine giving my kids their Kindle without this case! It has been our saving grace more than once. My kids saved their own money to buy a Kindle and I can just imagine how devastated they would be the first time it was accidentally dropped and then broken! This case has saved the Kindle on more than one occasion, with no scratches or dings! It even protects the screen and still makes it easy to use. The outer material is almost like the Nerf case we have for their DS. The stand is easy to use and great for when they are playing games for a long time. This case is well worth the money and does a great job protecting a Kindle.
This is a great case for the money. Would def. Recommend this case to anyone with a kindle fire. The only thing I have a problem with is that when you are listening to music, the music is muffled. Also with this case on it makes the music extremely quiet.
I bought thgis case for my kindle fire so I could let my super active and accident prone six year old use it. It has been a couple of months, my son has put the product to the test and I am happy to report that my confidence in this little cover was not misplaced.
Not much to say other than you get what you pay for. Case is very well built and looks like it will take a beating. Haven't dropped my Kindle yet so I can't say for certain if it offers good enough protection. The back stand, while functional, is kinda cheaply built. I think after many uses it will eventually break. However, its non-intrusive when not in use.
I love the durability and protection that the case provides, and I really wanted a case the encased the entire Kindle. This does that. HOwever, the touch screen sensitivity is affected by the screen protector. It is not difficult to use or unresponsive, it just requires a little more "touch!" Overall great product and I wouldn't hesitate to buy one for any additional devices.
The case has handled several drops, bumps, and thumps and held up very well. No problems and well worth the money spent.
It protects great. Feel safe carrying my kindle everywhere.
We bought our 3 year old son a Kindle Fire for his birthday and this case to go with it to help protect it. It has done its job so far! He has thrown it, dropped it, and played in it with messy hands. The screen cover is great! It works well and does not make it hard to navigate at all. I recommend this to anyone who wants to keep their Kindle safe...especially if you have kids!
The case is very solid and easy to hold, sturdy enough that during it's most recent fall it scuffed paint off a metal heater but it showed no damage other than the paint from the heater, the only issue I have with it is the above stated lint issue it seems to build up with no discernible cause on the screen under the screen protector.
If you want your Kindle or what ever else they make these cases (several different models) for to be protected even in much tougher than normal conditions (with in the bounds of common sense) this is the case you want to have. It is just a tad on the expensive side but worth it to protect your stuff. I would recommend these cases to anyone.
Bought this to protect my daughter's Kindle Fire. It works great and fits very well. It does add quite a bit of weight to the Kindle. She wishes it came in a wider range of colors.
A wonderful case that protects a Kindle Fire perfectly. With this case you don't have to worry about your Kindle getting scratched or damaged by falling. I've even taken mine out into the field with the Army. It's also very good for price compared to other high protection items.
I love this attractive case for the Kindle Fire!! It is sturdy, has a slot for a stylus, and is easy to access quickly.
Great colors and perfect for my Kindle Fire HD I have no worries when I carry it to work.
The unit is very small and compact. But it does pack a punch.
This is great for my Kindle. The Kindle fits perfect in it . It also allows for space for the buttons on the side and it has a stand so you can use it hands free. For example watching a movie.
This is very easy to use and works well for the purpose it was intended for.
I really like the black Belkin Kindle Fire HD case that I bought about a month ago. It allows easy insertion of the device into the case, looks great, fits securely, and has a nice texture. There is also a strap that you can fasten around the outside of the case, to ensure it remains closed, while the device is not in use. When in use, there are four angles that you can set the case to, depending on your position. Personally, I wish there were a fifth position, to allow the device to be more perpendicular to the horizontal surface on which it sits, for example 90 degrees; the fourth position is still on a bit too large of an angle (120 degrees), so that it's difficult to view the Kindle straight-on -- it's as though the Kindle is reclining too far and the image would be projected onto the ceiling rather than at the viewer. Unlike the other brand that my mother bought, this Belkin case allows you to charge your device while it is in the case, as there is an opening for the charging cord to come out of the top of the device. The downside is that to orient the device properly so that the charging cord comes out of the top, the camera has to be at the bottom of the device, which gives an odd view of yourself to others, if you're on Skype. The alternative would be to put your Kindle into the case the opposite way, but if the charging cord comes out the bottom, the stand will no longer be usable, because the cord is in the way. Also, for some apps, the orientation can only be portrait. In this case, the cover does not stand on its own and instead, has to be held, like a book. Overall, though, I really like this case and the issues described above are by no means showstoppers, just mild annoyances. Based on my mom's experience, I'm not sure to what degree other cover makers have dealt with the above issues -- for the "perfect" cover, you'd probably have to have enough familiarity with the device and your own preferences and then research other options.
I was torn a little about not giving the case the 5 star rating, but I feel to do that the item must reall meet all critical expectations. That said the case is sturdy, handsome and well padded, affording great protection for the Kindle. The standup feature works well, but the tab that goes in the slot to angle the unit upright is very thin and maybe fragile, time will tell. The one complaint is that the manual volume control buttons are partially blocked by the mounting tabs. Since the tabs are the same on each corner, it isn't a problem that can be solved by changing the orientation of the Kindle. So 4 stars but a very good item.
Excellent value. Purchase was for my wife's Kindle Fire HD and Che loves it.
This is a must for protecting your Kindle Fire. It is so easy to damage these electronics.
This case was easy to get the Kindle into, but it is still snug enough so the Kindle is not moving around. The case feels good to hold; it's not too heavy or bulky. The stand works perfectly, and allows adjustment for different angles.
I bought this product to protect my new Kindle Fire and it provides excellent protection from potential hazards.
Nice looking and works well with the Kindle Fire HD.
I love this case for my Kindle HD. My favorite feature is that it lets you swivel it from portrait view to landscape view and the prop up feature where you can prop up it up either way you swivel it.
no good quality..it doesn't fits so good..and its pricey
I love this cover, it was a little pricey but it's worth it. Cute, like a book cover, wonderful color and secure tab closure. I slide my stylus under the tab closure so it's with me when I take my tablet with me.
I really like this cover for my Kindle Fire HD 7. My only complaints are that there is no place to put my stylus like my Kindle Fire case did, and the magnetic closure covers the charger connection so you have to unlatch it to charge it. Neither one is a big deal. I really do like it a lot and I think it's beautiful!
I would recommend this product, especially for older folks like me. Because of size, lightweight,and bright color (easy to find)
Love this cover. It fits perfect, has a smooth touch, comfortable, and blends well with handbag / lap top case.
This is a 2nd purchase for us. We got one for my husbands Kindle Touch and I liked it so much that I got one for me when I ordered my Kindle Fire HD. I love that it is not a bright color or animal print. It just looks like an old leather book. It's very good quality.
I love this, great buy for a great price, i love it
I travel and I put my Kindle in my purse and laptop case. This cover protects it in both cases and it has a finish that has a grip. I love that the case folds and props up. I am very happy with this case and highly recommend it.
The salesman recommended it, and I'm glad I got it. Thanks
overall I like this product, it fits my new Fire HD perfectly, but to have it open like a book (which I prefer for reading). it is actually in the case upside down putting the buttons for power and volume on the bottom rather than the top. It's a minor nuisance, but it still kind of bugged me. It's also very light, so didn't add alot of bulk or weight to the Kindle, which I like.
love it... i am glad i got it. was a great value for the price.
love the color. nice price. works like it should. it protects my kindle.
I bought it to help protect the Kindle from breaking if dropped. It does that well. However, when it sits flat on a table and you tap the screen, it sometimes slides flat on the table. It requires velcrow tape to keep it from sliding down.
Very versital and convenient. It is an excellent. Case and I would recommend it to every one
My Axis case I purchased for my kindle is both handsome and funtional and protects it from the every day normal abuse.
I am happy with this case ... but still think all of these are over-priced.
I totally recommend this case for the Kindle Fire HD ! It fits it perfectly, looks nice and is comfortable to hold while your using your Kindle Fire HD. The case is very sturdy and is a product that I know will last me a long time. Protect your Kindle Fire HD with this case. It's totally worth spending a little extra money ! You will definitely be happy that you did !
I got this at the same time as my Kindle Fire and I like the way it protects the Kindle. The Swivel feature is wonderful!
This is a very nice cover for the Kindle. It is made really well and it protects it . Also come in some really nice colors.
I like this case because it is easy to spot in a dark bag, it is durable, and protects my Kindle Fire. The elastic band made it quick and easy to get into and serves several purposes. It props easily on the interior ridges in several positions for comfortable use. Overall, I was quite satisfied with this product.
there were a lot of choices for covers and I chose this one because it was colorful and it ended being very durable especialy since I have kids around
Great cover for the Kindle Fire. It sits up nicely if you are watching a movie. Protects the Fire. I love it! Very durable.
I would not have the strap that is attached with velcro. Too easy to lose. Would like to see an strap you can put your hand through and rest the book on the back of your hand. Arthritis in hands. Would be a great feature I haven't seen on other covers.
Excellent gift. The product works great for my daugther for her small business.
I received a great deal of criticism for my iPad 2 Review But Samsung seem to have taken some of that criticism to heart and built a better mouse trap. The Galaxy Tab 2 sports SD memory access and supports Flash. It has USB access and several other features that the iPad 2 and the iPad 3 do not. All three are excellent tablets but I have to say that this one seems to be better. The front facing stereo speakers are quite good for their size the Galaxy Tab 10.1 had side facing speakers. The addition of an SD Card reader makes it a more secure device for transferring data. I have no complaint about the graphics and there isn't a major heat issue. It is a bit pricy but you are getting quality goods. In future models I would like to see upgradeable memory and battery access.
it is a wonderful tablet! You can do everything with it..
Not a bad pad /android but it did not meet my expectations. I found that downloading games took too long and had difficulty finding things on it. It was also a odd size so I had difficulty finding a cover for it (unliess I wanted to pay another $60-80). Returned it and purchased a netbook.
I am enjoying this tablet. When I did a side by side with an iPad, I didn't see much difference for my needs. I am concerned about the music payer because it glitches on each song and I don't like the on-screen keyboard because it's cumbersome to get to the secondary keys like the question mark, etc., but I got a case with a keyboard to address that. Overall, it's a good tool and I like the design and the way I was able to personalize it. Would like more instruction on it though.
This is a lovely tablet, a little heavier than I would like but sleek and comes with lots of nice programs. I would recommend it to others and I would buy it again. The Operating system Ice Cream Sandwich is easy to use. Sure wish there were more instructions available and more covers to choose from for it.
Not worth the money. Slower than my phone (3G) and FB looks awful on the screen. Returned.
Got this as a father's father's day present and so far it has ran like a champ. Great price good battery life and sd slot made this the way to go.
Okay for games,, movies and basic simple stuff. Not enough memory to handle a work environment
I purchased this for a friend was extremly unhappy with best buy . I wanted to purchase the protection plan but was shy 1 day (31 days) would not honor protection plan purchase. I had just given it to my friend and was not sure if he wanted to keep it. This is BAD business. Will not be purchasing with Best Buy again in the future. With so many companies going out of business you would think that you would be wanting to make the customer happy. There are so many online shops and so many other stores selling the same items I will be using them in the future. It's bad to be so strict.
I was deciding to buy this item or an Ipad, but decided to buy the samsung galaxy, and I'm so glad I did. This is the best tablet ever!!!!
It is easy to using any function in the home screen and it is fast without delaying. You can get a screen shoot immediately and edit the photo after taking it.
With the tax and warranty on this thing I spent $500+ so that I could work on my tablet while in conference calls and meetings... all of the best buy staff sold me on this product over an I pad saying that it has alot more customization... it syncs better... all that mumbo jumbo. Well... literally the day after I bought this tablet I was syncing my email up to it and my work email signature didn't sync with it... confused I went into the email settings and copy and pasted my signature back into my email on my tablet. Soon after I noticed that the images that were in my signature {my companies logo} wasn't showing up... so I called Samsung support and they said oh I'm sorry... that just cant happen. You can't put images/websites/links or anything into your email signature. WELP GREAT.. I said.. I just spent $500+ on this thing only to find out that I can't do any work on my tablet which was the main reason I bought it because my signature on my email isn't correct... My company is VERY big on the "branding" of our company so everyone's email signatures have to match.. so this tablet basically is useless to me... I'm returning it tonight. Overall this tablet is great.. but I can't use it for any of the reason I needed it for.. if you just want it for games and movies this is a wonderful tablet.
This was my first tablet purchase, and as such, I spent alot of time shopping and asking questions. I settled on the Galaxy 2 for my purchase primarily because of having a cell phone with the Android OS and its ease of operation. I also am a fan of the Samsung product line and this Galaxy 2 has only cemented my loyalty to Samsung. I found the initial setup to be very easy and very very quick. Would I recommend this product? Without hesitation to any and everyone.
I purchased this because I wanted a tablet, but I didn't want the huge price the Ipad has. Since I have gotten it, I have found I use it alot. I am a former user of PDAs, and wanted to be able to take it to a conference and take my notes on it. I was able to purchase a keypad and downloaded Documents to Go (I have used this program on my PDAs). It was wonderful, and useful. Easy to download my notes to the desktop. I have downloaded Draw Something, and have a great time with the internet game. I really like my purchase. By the way, there are some really neat attachments, longer cords, etc. that you can purchase. I have also started using the Kindle library I have on it, and it so nice to be able to read in the dark. I have even gotten some small speakers! How fun is this.
It is just what I was looking for. A portable way to listen to music and play online games. Also great to stream movies to my PS3.
This is my best purchase of the year, this is working out great for fun stuff as well as business. The only thing that I would change would be more accessories like for the ipad
After using my wifes I Pad 2 for a couple of months I was worried I would not like this. I love it
I checked all specifications with Galaxy Tabled 2 and All Ipad series before I buy it. Galaxy tab 2 supports many media players plugins, streams all well known video formats. Expendable micro SD memory. HDMI out for TV connection. I could not see these specifications on any Ipad tablets. I am happy having Galaxy tab 2.
I've only had this tablet a month and I've sent it back to be serviced because it locked up a couple of times. I was able to turn it off and back on to unlock it, this last time it locked up at the Samsung logo and could not be shut off. Called Samsung and they had me ship it to them to be fixed. I'm still waiting..... My 2 yr old iPad has never locked up, wish I would have spent the extra $$$ for another iPad.
My daughter has one that I used when I visited her and I have also played with my sisters Ipad and I just liked the Samsung Galaxy better and I am very happy with it.
I was nervous purchasing a tablet and I investigated them all and decided on this one. It does everything your high end smart phones does. It is not limited much at all. And it has GPS even on the wifi only version which I have. It Needs a usb, a longer charging cord, and an update so we can have apps 2 sd. I realize this is a tablet so I utilize drop box and google docs and email to send what I need to save to my other computer or phone. or vise versa. I am very happy with the quality. It is not heavy and the picture is great. Netflix is the only issue with picture I have encountered it can be a bit grainy and the sound during netflix play is not loud enough. I don't seem to have these 2 issues with other apps. Again Im loving this tablet and still learning.
Screen is large and beautiful. Stays connected to my hotspot better than my previous tablet . Great battery life. love it!!!!!!
Thrilled to see two things added to this version. Ability to add SDHD memory slot, allows for more music, movies and pictures. can swap out for more options. The TV IR was also very good, but dissappointed in the App that is available. The interface is nice, but does not function (integrate with TV Guide), as well as I hoped. Would have preferred an upgrade the CPU, there are times a faster, quad chip would work nice. Love the screen quality. Have traveled with it and it interfaces well into local WiFi, remembers home, work or other places. The Map holds enough general information that you can still track where you are during a road trip. Works well as a singel device for all fo the items that I wanted. eBook, MP3, Videos, music, email, calendar, Internet browsing, news, maps, drawing, piano, games. The camera quality is only 3MP, but that is fine, I expect to use phone or camera for most pictures.
Great screen, easy to use, plenty of downloads. Fast wi-fi. Fun to use as a tv remote!
I researched the top 3 or 4 tablets and thought I was getting the best for the price. Got the 1st tablet home turned it on and started setup, got into the google email set up, then tablet shut off and couldn't get it turned back on,returned it to store and after geek squad couldn't get it on either they exchanged it. Tablet Number 2 home and the very same problem occurred returned it and received a 3rd tablet. Geek Squad had me set it up while at the store and this one seemed fine. After taking it home and playing with it I discovered their was no sound coming from speakers, did a hard reset and the sound started working. Works great so far
After five weeks using the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 10.1 as my primary ebook reader, email device, MP3 player and internet access device, I find the machine works well and fits my needs while traveling without a full-blown laptop. As I was able to puchase an inexpensive USB-Card Reader connection device, the lack of an integrated USB port has had little impact on me. The WiFi capability works great for internet access and I regularly use the Bluetooth connection with a generic external keyboard.
I have had this for a month and it works great. Early issues were - did not know how to operate a lot of things, like controlling how long it stays on before going black, switching off autofill and a host of other things. The Manual is not helpful at all and if you get stuck on something most of the time it didn't provide a solution. Several times I had to ask my 12 year old if she new the answer to something that I couldn't figure out and she would fix it for me. If not for her I would have taken it back to the store several times thinking there was something wrong with it. They just need more tips in the manual. Once you figure everything out its a great tablet. Just bought the HDTV adapter and I am now streaming movies on my Large Screen TV. I am happy with my purchase.
I am very impressed with this and the features it has. I have a notebook that struggles to play netflix, but i have no problems with this playing it¡ and in HD at that. The infrared remote this has is a bonus too. I have also found just about every app that apple has. The new android platform is beyond some of them, but too few to worry about.
Love it except for the fact that it won't recognize any printers that aren't made by Samsung. That really sucks! Everything else is cool.
I thought I did enough research, but I didn't know what I really needed until I purchased this tablet, first of all to move around info from phone, other computers, it has to be done by email, or purchase an adapter, < I finally got smart and purchased one online MUCH less expensive than the 'retailers' wanted > the second week I had the tablet it finally arrived, but only after one night when I was viewing an online film, it locked up with this most annoying repeating sound like a cd/dvd getting stuck.. another thing I found out, This particular brand does not have a hard shut off so to solve this problem, I had to let the 70% battery run out to shut it down, what a pain... the following night after thinking I am done with this, I attempted to watch the film again whereupon, after approx 15 min the wireless shut down.. no reason, did this 5 times. the adapter arrived the following morning, I packed it back in the package <tablet > and returned to Best Buy to Purchase the Toshiba 32 gig 10.1 tablet, as it DOES have a built in USB Port with the same operating system. stay away from Samsung 2 10.1.
I love it and I give it to my nephew he is really happy
We love this notebook and tell everyone BUY IT. It has worked way past our expectations and never slows down.
Very easy to use tablet with good performance and able to make a 48Gb high-end tablet for ~$420 ($399 for tablet and ~$20 for 32Gb micro-SD card). Open architecture with Android. Pros: Android 4, micro SD card slot, extremely easy to set up (transferred information from my Android phone), good screen and battery life Cons: Difficult to use software to connect to PC - minor point since that doesn't happen often but have not been able to get Samsung Kies to work (but unlike Apple, can just insert micro-SD card into PC and transfer files)
I am a huge fan of this product. I have had no issues with my Galaxy Tab. The screen size is perfect. The sound quality is really nice. Easy to use and set up. This is a must buy for people looking for a new tablet!!! Awesome product.
I went to my local Best Buy and took literally 1 hour looking at both the I Pad 2 and the Android counterpart the Samsung Galaxy. I have an Android phone so I am very aware of the operating system. I finally chose the Galaxy for a number of reasons.; 1) 100.00 less, 2) larger screen, 10 in vs 7 in, 3) speed a little slower but not critical for my use,4) set up and use unbelievably simple. I've used it for a week and feel I made the right choice in Tablets.
great tab ,a little pricey but well worth it.lots of fun for the family.
I went in originally to buy the iPad 2 since I needed a tablet for work, and didn't feel like investing a lot of money on the "new" iPad. Honestly, I felt like I had to buy the iPad because there are a lot more accessories geared towards the iPad than any other tablet. So, I walk over to the iPad section and there are a bunch of people playing with them. I decide to look around and wait until the crowd dwindled. And that is when I saw the Samsung Galaxy tab all by it's lonesome. The bright display and widgets immediately caught my attention and since I'm already a droid user, it was easy for me to navigate through the system. I asked a sales rep how much it was, and he said it was 399. I didn't jump on it YET, but went to play with the iPad and was not sold. I fell in love with the Galaxy tab and it's opportunity to expand it's memory with a micro SD card, something you can't do on an iPad. It's easy to use and not to mention it's battery life is awesome.
SO TODAY I DECIDE TO EXCHANGE MY GALAXY TAB2 10.1 FOR A NEWE TOSHIBA EXICTE, AND LET ME TELL YA IM GOING TOMORROW TO RETURN THIS TOSHIBA AND GET MY TAB2 AGAIN, DO NOT GET THE TOSHIBA, HAS A WEAK SCREEN, VERY POOR QUALITY AND THE PROCESSOR IS NOT THAT FAST EVEN THO IT SAYS ITS A QUADCORE.,,, SAMSUNG RULES !!!!!
I got this for my wife for mothers day (my kids gave it to her from them) She never used a "smart phone" or "tab" before so, the screen was strange for awhile of course. But, she loves it now! It is packed with features that are easy for her to use. The camera could be a higher mega pixel, but we have a good camera for the important shots. Battery life is great if you keep the sound low, but still lasts several hours longer than her lap top. It doesn't get hot like the lap top either. Overall very good tablet.
The sleek design and feel is very good. Recently bought my wife an I-pad2 when the prices dropped (otherwise I think the I-pads, although excellent, are overpriced). I've only had the Galaxy a couple of days but it was very easy to set up right out of the box. I also own a Xoom and my apps were automatically downloaded to the new Galaxy. Email accounts were easy to setup. Battery life appears excellent. I find the build to be very good plus it will be in a folio so not sure there should be much concern on this point. Sounds quality, like most tablets is adequate but not great. Have speakers on each side of screen wich contribute to good volume which is easily controlled by the rocker volume control. Screen resolution seems very good. I've watched one movie and thought it was excellent. I was particularly interested in the fact you could easily add a micro SD to double or triple the memory. I suspect if you are a hard core gamer, the dual core system may not be up to the task but for watching media, surfing he web, emai, etc. it is more than adequate. The price is great for tablet with these features.
I love this tablet. It is so light weight and easy to use. I can check e-mail, read a book, and chat. It is a great addition to my life.
I just received mine as a gift and I love it. I've been watching Netflix on it everyday. Battery stays charged for a long time. So many things to do on it...can't wait to use mine to read some books. I can check my facebook, email, you name it! Awesome! The only problem I encountered initially is logging on to the internet. I had to restart my unit...a word to the wise if you cannot log on to your online service when first setting up your tablet do a restart.
I purchased this to read books,email, see and share picasa pictures and run more apps. I found out in 2 days that the gallery does not sync with Picasa.I called up Samsung support and after hard resets and exhausting all options I was told that the gallery does not support picasa and asked me to download other picasa related third party apps. I use a samsung galaxy s2 phone with an older version of android(gingerbread) and it shows all my picasa picture with upload capabilities. On the tablet I expected the same or better. Well I am dissapointed and the tech support from samsung were clueless about their own products. Since it is only 2 days I would rather return it back and use my money wisely.
Really simple to use and the battery Life is very Long around 10 to 11 hours that's really great!!!!
This is my 1st tablet. I rather the Android OS because my phones are Android. The 4.0 OS is pretty awesome.. I haven't found anything to dislike about it in the week we've had it. App panels are easily customizable. Everything from sound to video is pretty sharp. It's not a camera, so I'm not worried much about that. Surfing the web, facebook and playing games, is what it's for and it does that very well. My 8y/o can't keep her hands off it. Bought the Belkin folding case for the original Tab. It fits but covers the speakers, there is a little difference in volume, but still loud enough.
This is my first tablet and I love it. Most electronics in our house are Samsung and I wanted something to pull them all together, and it did. I love that I can set up the tv channels and even change them (remote) from the tablet. I'm still figuring out everything it can do, but if you're new to tablets, this one is so easy and fun. The flip covers are obnoxiously expensive but I've found several on eBay for $15. My husband's came in yesterday... 3 days from Hong Kong... and it's exactly like the ones for $60 in most stores. (PS) If you let the battery go completely dead, like I did, be ready to wait quite a while for it to charge. When it isn't completely dead, it charges at a pretty good rate.
I like it more then I thought I would. After reading some of the pro review sites I thought this would be a disapointment. But it is really nice. I like my galaxy phone and this thing feels identicle just bigger and with a really good screen as well. It is familiar and easy to use. The build quality is top notch and the speaker placement is great for multi media like netflix. The remote function is really cool and I see a lot more potential then what they have in it right now. I really dig the screen capture button and how you can draw on it easily. I plan on using this a lot. I do not care about the camera as I have a DSLR and my phone for things like that . I cant imagine wipping this thing our on a regular basis for taking pictures. If they dropped the price to $350 they would have a home run with this product. .
I am a new user to tablets and didn't want to spend a lot of money on an ipad. Looking for a great alternative to it and this was it. I do wish it had a better camera but you can still do alot with 3 megapixels. I plan to use it with the adobe cloud and offers me some better ways to touch up photos. Have down load Adobe ps touch. Works great so I can work on both the tablet and computer. I can also use it in my husbands business. The batter life with constant use has been great thus far. Over 12 hours. I don't blame a device or apps for what I have to learn using them. I am inexperienced as it is my first but I love it. Purchased a cover for the tab10.1 and it works fine with the tablet. Added a card to save files too. Love it and would recommend it to a fried.
I bought this tablet last night in roseville, I was checking between the Asus tf300 and this one....this one looks like have better construction and brighter display....i was "playing" in the store a while with differents tablets and this one convinced me better than others ...the only thing that is not that good is the fact that it comes with 16gb storage for 399.00 when the Asus tf300 comes with 32gb storage for the same price...however, after playing several hours with many aplications i found this tablet with no major issues in performance...set up was pretty easy....I don't care about camera, or video stuffs..for that i have my nikon d7000, my sony a77, and my sony hd camcorder...so just for the use of the tablet itself...it's pretty nice in your hands and perform very well...
It took me a couple of Days to accept this tablet, but I'm content with it now. The display is mesmerizing and in-app performance is solid. Other than things common to all Samsung devices I've owned, my only complaints are transitional studder and keyboard lag. Though this will probably be addressed with software updates (given that it's Samsung, probably in about two years) vertical web page scrolling will give a designer nightmares. However, in regard to my 4-star rating, it is still the best in class as i've laid hands on all of the new ICS contenders. If you're new to Samsung devices, the first important sanity-saving tip is to install an alternate keyboard and turn off autocorrect.
Awesome product, but why it only have 3.0 mp Camera ?
we've always had desktops and laptops and it was time for us to get a new computer, so instead of doing the traditional laptop, we decided to get a tablet and just fell in love with the samsung tablet. had to wait for the weekend to get it, but i think i got the first one in the area. the camera and video quality is pretty good. even though i bought it for our use but my 3 month old son is using it to watch tom & jerry. it was a good buy!
As of to date, this is the best computing device I have ever used because of its portability and easy to operate. It is quite impressive and I like the feel of it. The only drawback is the lack of external ports which I think Samsung should work on it; I believe that it is overpriced too. Other than that, this is a great product. JB
This is a great alternative to the IPad. I love the Google connectivity and it's versatility.
I bought this tablet primarily for work. I am constantly in meetings at different locations, have to track multiple tasks, and needed a centralized location to store meeting notes/project notes. The Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 has completely fulfilled these needs. It is also excellent for multimedia. I have loaded music and I stream movies from Netflix when I travel. It does this flawlessly. The screen is the perfect size, whether watching videos or typing on the screen. I also like the fact that with a small adapter, I can save files on a USB stick drive and easily transfer them to my home and work PC. In addition, I also use it as a Nook reader, so I can enjoy my favorite books in my personal time. I am very happy with this purchase and would recommend it to anyone.
Product is ok to many updates with out warning also doesn't support a lot of sites I need to be on with causes me to have.to use my laptop
I chose Samsung because I got sick of converting the format for movies, music etc for Mac. I have an Ipod touch that I have to convert all of my music and video files in order to play on the ipod. I don't have a Mac computer so it's a pain to convert files. Samsung plays all of my current files and together with my galaxy III phone, everything syncs automatically.
Samsung quality control is terrible. The 1st Galaxy Tab 2 was frozen after Samsung updated the software. Called customer service, but they was able to help fixing the issue. Returned and exchanged for 2nd Galaxy Tab 2. Well, I have used for a month and it was completely dead when I charged it. It was unable to turn on at all. Returned the 2nd one. Just bought 3rd Galaxy Tab 2 from Costco and after 3 days the screen became flurry and discolored. Must return again and will never buy it again. Do yourself a favorite, don't buy this junk!
I love everything about this tab.... so functional.... i love that i can use it for work. super fast response time. external memory is a must for me, so i love that too. the only thing i dont like is where the buttons are locatied. not sure if its because i'm a lefty and it feels weird, but who knows. another great samsung product for my collection!
I ordered this tablet online, and picked up at my local store. Plugged it in when I got home to charge it. Took about 3 to 4 hours to charge fully. After that I was off and running. Keyboard takes some getting used to. Auto fill can be a little frustrating at times if you don't pay attention. I am used to using window explorer at work, and the file structure on this takes some getting used to. Screen is clear, but I turned the brightness all the up. Little on the dark side for my tastes. Minor issues. Highly recommend this.
The battery life is pretty great, the screen clarity is nice, and the night time reading feature is my favorite. The speakers are pretty great, and play music loud enough to hear across the whole room. Another feature I love is great alarm clock which also relies on the good speakers that are built in. It will never replace a speaker dock when it comes to sound, but definitely loud enough to wake me up in-Style.
We purchased the Galaxy Tab 2 after the Galaxy S 3 phones, and comparing the two does throw the slower performance of the tab into sharp contrast. However, the hardware is not slow, and it runs all the apps and media we throw at it perfectly well, when it is working. That being said, a reboot is often required to restore function when the video or sound stops working on apps like Netflix. Not sure if this is a defect in our hardware, or a flaw inherent in the OSE or Tab 2 design.
Great product. I got it primarily for my wife. She uses mostly for reading; she also plays a few games, checks email, and surfs the internet some. Neither of us have had ANY trouble with it. I was hesitant to get a tab/pad with an Android OS since our phones running Gingerbread had been giving us a lot of trouble, but I am pleasantly surprised.
I love this tablet. It is convenient for everything. I just wish I brought a data plan so I can go on the internet more often.
I was looking to buy a tablet and although not a fan of Apple, I had originally thought of buying an iPad (the new iPad) since they're recognized as the "best". Half my family uses Apple products so I'm familiar with them but was still a bit hesitant however, and started looking around when I came across this tablet and was immediately drawn to it. After seeing all the features it had like the microSD slot for more data, I was sold! Being an Android user for years as well as a Samsung user/fan, I found it easy to use and costumize. It also syncs with my Samsung Galaxy S3 which I really liked! It's like my phone, only bigger! The camera takes decent pictures in appropiate light. Screen is bright and clear, videos play clear as well, sound is good. I've had it only a couple of days and I'm very happy with it! Haven't used my laptop since, I just can't seem to put my tab down! I don't regret my decision. I love my tab as did my brother and sister, they now want one too just like mine they say, not an iPad and they're both Apple users/fans!!
love the speed it has with the processor and the screen resolution, I studied both the ipad and the galaxy tab and I chose the Galaxy tab.
I'm completely satisfied with this tablet. Everything works great and perfectly. The price is even cheaper than ipad. I haven't found any problems at all. I'm a samsung fan. All electronics i have at home are samsung. They are awesome. Trust me!
Its lite with a crisp display and crazy easy to get started. Even my gadget savvy teenager loves it over all other tablets in the market. I've used the other top brands and this is by far the most flexible and easy to use. No buyers remorse here.
I looked at several different tablets before purchasing the Samsung GalaxyTab 2. I have no idea how I survived as long as I did without it. If you buy one you won't regret it.
This is a very nice device, it won't let you down.
I had this over a weekend and exchanged it for the asus tf300 which I gave 5 stars. the samsung's screen seemed to lag at times, and performance in general was buggy.
when i open it i was a little scared because is so thin, but once you charge and use it you are amazed by it, the best tablet ever made
Very nice screen and picture quality. Long lasting battery. Fast apps and easy to use and set up quickly.
I can do whatever an I-pad user can for a lower price.
Other than weak WiFi reception (which is typical of most tablets) and the not-so-great email app that comes with this tab, I have nothing bad to say which is unusual because I am normally very picky about what I buy. There are lots of apps to choose from out there, some are free and more are on the way. I chose this over the iPad hands down. Go buy one! You'll love it
Purchased this as a gift for a relative. After 3 months of use lines started to appear on the screen and flickered continuously. The problem progressively became worse rendering the tablet unusable. The tablet was sent back to Samsung. They supposedly fixed it but after using it again for 3 days the same problem returned. According to the Geek Squad the manufacturer will not let them replace it so back it goes to Samsung. I own the Ipad 1 and 2 and wish I had recommended either of those products. The only reason we went for the Galaxy was because my relative uses an Android phone. By all accounts this product stinks. Judging by the forums I see many others have experienced similar issues. Buyers beware, avoid this product.
This is an awesome little device. I can't seem to put it done. At home or on the go, this baby is a must have! I highly recommend it.
This is not a good tablet. Do not buy it. It is running a skinned version of Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich. It is laggy and crash-prone. This is a heavy tablet that does not look very good compared to the original Galaxy Tab 10.1. Do yourself a favor and buy the Nexus 7 or perhaps consider the Transformer Pad Infinity.
Couldn't of asked for a better product. Really superb product overall.
Love Love Love my Galaxy Tab II !!!! So nice - beautifully priced - technologically advanced - has all the bells and whistles - is far superior to the iPad!! Most all the apps are free! Samsung is capturing the market.
My initial purchase was the 7 in. Galaxy Tab 2. I had it less than a month and traded up the the 10.1. My husband and I both had E readers. We are avid readers and really enjoyed them. I bought the 7in to replace my E-reader because the Tab 2 has a faster processor. Faster processor better expierence surfing the web, checking emails and etc. My husband tried my 7 in and declared he liked it but would rather a larger screen. To make a long story short we traded in both E-readers and the 7 in. tab 2 and each of us came home with the Samsung Galaxy Tab2 10.1 and haven't looked back. My husband and I each have over 800 books on micro sd cards. I have a 16 gb micro card in mine with music, videos, my books and over 3.25 gb of 6 different quilting and sewing magazines in pdf format. I use the adobe reader to read my magazines. I also read those magazines on my last e reader but really love the larger screen to read them now. I use the free Cool Reader App for my books. We read constantly so was very picky when picking a good reading app. Only accessory that we purchased other than covers was the Samsung usb connector. Just tried it today to transfer the latest issue of a magazine. So fast, easy hook up and convenient. No pc involved once the file was put on the usb. We recently took a long weekend trip and had our Tablets with us. My husband was even able to access his web service email while we were on the road. We both have phones that can be used as mobile hotspots and that feature worked flawlessly also. We would recomend the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 10.1.
Tried several other tabs before buying The Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 10.1, The SD port is definitely a plus and I purchased the available USB adapter for even greater storage flexibility. Front facing speakers are nice and the sound quality is good. Liked my tablet so much, my husband tried it and bought one, too.
stereo sound, nice screen, good size and Android 4.0 lack of 3G can be solved by sharing wi-fi from the cellphone. so this tab is almost perfect for me.
I researched many cases for my new tablet. This one provides many different viewing options and also has one of the lower profiles.
I am very pleased with this item. I can hold my tablet on my knee to enter information or play games. My tablet is also secure for traveling about.
Nicely made. Fits the Samsung 8.9 very well. Has multiple viewing positions.
This case works really well with my Galaxy Tab 8.9. It fits nicely, all buttons are accessible. It allows for stand-up or lay-down modes. It's sturdy and with it on I'm confident enough to let my 2-year-old carry the tablet around. Only three complaints, the holes for the buttons aren't very snug, so I feel like I'm constantly pulling at the edges. It's not a big deal but makes me worried I'm ruining the case. My second issue is it's my primary e-reader and the case doesn't lend itself to easy portfolio viewing because even folded flat it's too thick, my hand starts hurting after awhile. So I like to remove it from the case when I know I'm going to be doing a lot of reading -- which leads me to the third complaint. It's a little too snug for easily removing. This is a good thing for most people because it helps prevent dirt from getting in there. But if you're an avid reader you may want to decide if you really want this product.
This is a great cover for the money and works well with the Kindlefire
If you need a case for the Nexus 7 this one works nicely. The case can be opened and the cover folds into a nice triangle hand grip for reading. You can also fold back and forth a kick stand for landscape. The stylist loop is already showing elastic failure after about two months of daily use. But the case while having picked up a stain or two is standing up to the use. Protects your tablet well and much better than any other 7 cover I have seen so far.
It works, that's about all. Color is nice, clasp not so good
Love love this case! I recently gave my Galaxy Tab 10. inch to my daughter and purchased the 7. inch (so I wouldn't have to carry such a huge purse!) but I was disappointed to see there aren't many assessories for it. I gave a couple cases, which were made for the kindle fire, a try and I decided on this one. It's not bulky, the outside is smooth and the clasp is really neat. The four elastic straps on the inside hold it snugly and non-skid material is great for protecting the screen. I am very happy with my purchase.
I like this little tablet because it is MUCH better than the iPad! The reason it's better is because of the size...7" is MUCH nicer than 10". I bought this because I kept going into Best Buy Mobile all the time just to play with it because I was waiting to see if the price would go down to $199.99 or something. I use this with my Mifi from Virgin Mobile USA so it's with me just about everywhere I go (especially work). If you want a tablet that'll beat the iPad (my opinion), this is the one for you - perfect touch keyboard, size and features it has!
All in all very much worth the price. I'm still not convinced that they are the "pc" of the future but they can be somewhat useful. More of a toy than a tool but performs as advertised.
About what I expected. Great for couch surfing. Peel remote function was great, until it failed to work after two weeks. "They are working on it". Battery life good. Some web sites do not render well, but a great product overall.
I can do anything on this tablet, my husband uses it every single day. We don't like how when your on video chat you see the person your talking to sideways. I don't have any complaints other than that issue. We can read books, watch videos, shop and etc on this baby.
I run a book review blog and i frequently download books to review. I bought this as an ereader so i could download all the reader apps. The screen is very clear for reading and now it has also turned into my daily planner. I love it.
I have really enjoyed my new Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7.0 -- I have downloaded some apps (I had never done that before, but it was easy.) I have been using the "dropbox" since that was already set up on my computer. I'm having fun with it and would recommend this to others.
I like this device, love the form factor, love the speed and ease of use...but it is not an ipad...and the store is more confusing than it should be I think
I love it! Súper fast and light and portable and not so expensive
I am a college student, This was my first tablet. It was a great find and buy. Tablet worked great! The new android "Ice Cream Sandwich" Processor did its work and kept up with running applications. The programs on this tablet was easy to access and ran smoothly. The only problem with the tablet was the accessories where only limited due to the new galaxy tab for the 10" size. Some of the programs would crash but it wasn't the Tablet's fault. Other than that great wifi range! and Perfect for your reading, checking email, bank accounts, facebook, and all your social needs. (Note: wifi is always required to check)
Bought this for my husband, who knows nothing about computers, but wants to play on them. This has been a great alternative...he doesn't take direction well, but has figured it out on his own. He loves it, and keeps up with it. The guys at his work also love playing with it, so I would say it's a hit. The size is just right, he has big fingers, and uses a stylus, but this size is great! Fingerprints on the face are terrible!
I bought this a few days ago. I have been wearing it out, and so have my kids. Beautiful screen, best I have seen especially in bright sunlight. Extremely good battery life, I'm getting more than 10 hours of use on a charge. Decent speakers, sound good for the size. Very responsive, no software issues. The apps that I use work great on it and it comes with some neat software built-in. Fast 3.0 Bluetooth and 802.11N wireless networking. Has a great utility for sharing/saving/retrieving files from external network devices. Highly recommend!! For the money, I don't know how to beat it. May need to get a separate case and I got the Zagg invisibleSHIELD and the 16GB microSD card. Awesome purchase!!
You can use entire internal memory for your apps unlike Fire & Nook. You can download any app from Google Play. The speakers are awesome. Wireless N is super fast. Bluetooth allows wireless keyboard connections. Kindle app allowed me to give away my other Kindle. Netfix app works great...no hesitation from buffering. I hardly ever use my laptop anymore. Highly recommend it.
I purchased it to replace my iPod touch (used mostly for e-mail and Internet access) and my original nook e-reader. I wanted something small and light, but a better tablet than nook or Kindle's. I wasn't disappointed. This tablet is exactly what I was looking for. The 7 inch screen is a big step up in viewabilty for Internet use, but it's still small and light enough to be a good e-reader. Wish there were more accessories available, though. Moving my music has been the most difficult thing I've tried to do so far. That and getting used to a different app store.
I bought this tablet at my local Best Buy, about a week ago, as a gift for my wife. I researched all the tablets, and read every comment I could find, good and bad. My priorities: small, reasonable price, expandable memory, front/rear cameras. fortunately, my wife loves it and is delighted with the features that she is still discovering. Her priorities: Skype, book consumption, light internet searching, games. We are both fantastically pleased with this tablet! The glass is pretty "draggy", compared to Apple product, but I added a screen protective film, and it is now appropriately slick. It is not as intuitive as iPad, so be prepared for that. You do have to explore the menus and applications for a while before some features can be located. Some of our difficulty could be from general ignorance of Android devices prior to this one. My only other issue isn't with the product itself, but with the Best Buy sales staff. I made up my mind what I wanted before I went to the store. All I needed to do was to confirm my decision by touching the actual item. When I arrived at the store, I went directly to the display. A staffer was standing next to it and asked if he could help. I told him that I was interested in the Galaxy 2 7.0, and wanted to know what he thought was fantastic about it. He replied, and I quote here, "not much". After a short conversation it became clear to me that his purpose in life was to sell iPads, and I wasn't there to buy one. I told him I was buying the Galaxy 2 7.0 anyway, and then I had to ask where I would get one for purchase. He pointed to the shelf below the display. I grabbed the boxed product, and he then took it from me so that he could ring it up. On the way to the register, I asked about covers, while I was glancing at the dozens of choices on a nearby rack. He said "those are for iPad", and then pointed to the lone $40 cover available in-store for the Galaxy. I said, "I'll look on online", made my purchase, and got out of there. After I got home, I did look online, and found a great cover for less than half their price. I only bought this tablet at a physical Best Buy store because 1.) I wanted to touch it first; 2.) I wanted to be able to return it in case she didn't like it; and 3.) I didn't want to wait for it to be shipped. After this experience, I am pretty sure I've made my last purchase at Best Buy. Still, it's a great tablet. I just should have bought it elsewhere.
Operating system - Androids new OS is nice, but samsung only alows their printers to be used on this tablet :-( .... HUGE setback. Lucky for me there's an app for that! Other than that the OS is amazing, its easy to use since i have an android phone i knew where most icons were and how to change settings and appears to run faster loading apps! power - i love that this tablet is light AND powerful. I can watch movies, surf the net and much more without lag(so far#. Used it at work all day long and still had 20% left for solitar after work! I can finally read a but without turning the page every five words#cell phone# or taking breaks because my wrist gets tired of hold the tablet up #ipad3#. If you took out the printer restrictions and added a 8mp rear camera i would consider it being a good replacement for my ipad3 for work.#i need to take HD pictures# screen - screen size is perfect for what i need, bigger than a cell phone yet smaller than an ipad. Makes it easy to read a book or watch a movie without straining your wrists. Also, the screen seems to be very durable, i have had it for weeks now and there are no scratches on the screen.#yet# camera- The camers is something that i could stand to see upgraded as it's only 3mp. Dont get me wrong, it takes good pictures but u can tell they are not very HD. Micro SD card reader- I have not yet needed to upgrade the memory of this tablet yet. I have al ot of pictures and applications stored on this device so far and still have 2gb left free. This tablet comes with an app called smart remote, this app is awesome! I programm\ed in my TV without telling the wife and had a little fun with it. Changing channels, raising and lowering the volume, awe it was a lot of fun#for me). Drove her nuts, in short it worked great and its a nice feture if you have a lot of remotes you can never find.
i recive this has brithday gift and love it; i use almost every day; paying; web surf etc
I have been waiting for a 7" Tablet, with the features that I wanted and so far this is it. I own an iPad and an Asus Transformer. I love the Transformer, but needed something in the 7" size with the features that I wanted. One of the features that I had to have was a Micro SD card. The only reason I gave it 4 Stars, was the low 3 MP camera. Other then that....I love it.
This is a perfect tablet for a girl on the go. The 7" size is great for fitting right in my purse. It has excellent speed, WiFi works great, its easy to read books off of it and watch movies or nexflix. Its like a reader on steroids.
It has andriod 4.0 (ics). Very simple tablet to work with and keeps improving as play with it.
I traded my Kindle for this tablet thinking that I could use it to read and check my email when I travel. Let's just say that I have not read a book since I purchased it and I have only been using my laptop to pay bills. I love this tablet. I can surf the web, play games, watch movies, use facebook, and I have downloaded all kinds of apps. This is a great machine for the price. The screen is very clear and the color is vivid. The speakers are awesome. I am not thrilled with the pictures that I have taken with it. It also can lose WIFI connection easily. This happens randomly and may happen quite frequently for a couple of days and then not again for a week. I know it is not my internet service because other WIFI devices in my home are working. The only thing that makes me feel better about this is that my Aunt said her Apple IPAD also randomly drops the WIFI connection. It is however, very easy to reset.
I have a Viewsonic 10" tablet but it turned out to be uncomfortable to hold very long. I love this one- it's thinner, lighter. The display is gorgeous, using it is intuitive. Love everything about it but the SD card fiasco. I see no point to having an SD card slot when nothing can be moved to it. I WILL run out of space when I thought I wouldn't have to worry about it.
works great . Have had no problems. Paid to have geek squad set it up , would not do that again. Wasted money.
My wife was talking about the Kindle Fire and how she wanted one on a Saturday, I went to BestBuy and knew she would like the camera in the Galaxy. Well she loves it and we took it on Vacation to the Grand Canyon and it was great for the Panoramic shots easy to read e-books and of course it makes my wife Smile
I bought this tablet for casual use. Checking the weather and email, looking at pictures of movies that we've taken. It is also going to be taken when we're traveling. I didn't want a $500 iPad for causal use. I've had it about a month and it's fine for all those things. I've set it up to synch with a couple of email accounts and loaded a few apps. The browser is a bit problematic. The tablet can be turned off for a couple of days and instead of going to the home page it goes back to the last page. Not a big deal just bothersome. I've added a memory card and transferred some pictures and home videos. It's all fairly easy except none of the players that came on the tablet wanted to play the mpgs from my video camera. So I found one on the Play Store and downloaded it. I can use the Polaris suite to open documents and I've tried the Dropbox app as a way to share files with my home computer as well.I activated Kindle and I've got books in Kindle and the Google app. There's a large selection of free and inexpensive apps. I did load the Norton for tablets as well since I want to use this at public internet sites. Nothing too difficult in any of this. One complaint though is I thought I owned this tablet since I paid Best Buy for it. I found out Samsung still seems to retain some ownership. I went to remove some apps I know I'll never use and couldn't so I was forced to look in the manual. It seems you can't uninstall apps like Chat or Netflix that come preloaded. I don't frankly think that's right when I own the device. I figure the more apps I clear out that I won't use the more room there is for apps I want to use. I may take this up with Samsung.
My 8 year old daughter traded in her Ipod touch to get this tablet. Her first comment was that it was so much faster than her Ipod. She was able to navigate most all aspects of the tablet by herself. I helped her set up some wigets on the home screen. The Peel Smart Remote app is truly awesome!! We were able to have it control the TV, Cable/DVR box, surround sound & Blue Ray player. It was very easy to set up. For the price, you can't go wrong!!
Short review version: The 7" screen is bright and clear, battery life is good, and the Samsung-altered version of Android is useable. All seems good... until you need WiFi. I noticed quickly that the Tab's WiFi signal dropped to only 1 bar when I was only two interior rooms away from my AT&T Uverse router. So weak was the signal that the download speeds were only barely above dialup, and would not increase until I literally got one room away or closer to the router. Rebooting and resetting the device made no difference. Samsung support simply suggested shipping it to them for repair/service, but upon investigating online, I've discovered a fair number of people who are also having this issue as well. Simply put, the inner WiFi antennae is poorly placed and not high powered, and in conditions where other devices may get a strong signal, the Tab will not. Perhaps this will be fixed in a future firmware update (once Samsung admits to the problem), or not. And your living conditions may not cause this problem to show itself as badly as others. My suggestion is to thoroughly test the tab throughout your house, take speed tests, and try out skyping, youtube, etc., to make sure the signal is good for you during the return period.
This Tablet has a nice size. Lite and easy to handle and you can increase size of page to see better.
Had a galaxy tab 10.1 which I liked but was hindered by the honeycomb OS. After rooting and putting a ICS ROM on it most of the lag went away and it became a new device. I still thought is was a bit bigger then what I wanted so when the tab 2 7.0 came out I picked on up. For me the 7 inch size is perfect. It fits in my front pocket if I need it to and you can hold it in one hand to read, email, and web browsing. The screen is nice and bright with good blacks and colors. The OS is responsive although I can't wait for the improvements of Jelly Bean. The storage is a little craamped but I've added a 64GB micro SD card that's taken care of that. Overall a very nice device at a good price.
I bought this to take on a trip overseas, as I wanted to have wireless access, but didn't want to take a full size laptop. Nice compact tablet, easily fits in my purse to take with me, large enough screen size that I don't have to squint, like I would with my phone, or have to see only a small portion of the page. Lots of fun apps at the google store.
I bought this to read emails, read books and watch movies. This better to do all the aforementioned with the larger screen than on my DROIDX and my Ipod Touch . Great that all of my Android phone apps are available on the tablet. ICS is different from gingerbread, but you get use to it with use. It runs faster than my DROIDX and chrome browser run smooth and fast. Amazing google gets chrome for IOS devices, but unless you are running ICS you can't get it.
great tablet . perfect for what i needed. easy to use. would recomend for anyone!
I lost my Sony reader on a plane and it contained lots of books I had not read. I wanted the new reader to have a back light and be able to down load the Sony books as well as Kindle and Nook. I was a bonous for me to have it access the internet, play games, and fit in my purse. This reader has it all and is easy for an older person unfamiliar with much of todays technology to be able to operate it with easy. I have not learned it all yet, but I am working on it.
Nice Tablet, we have bought it as a gift for our grandson and he really enjoys it
Love my tab! Works great! Would buy again. I love that it was a good deal too
This is a great unit for business, reading and searching for quick things on the net, great for checking your emails. I would recommend this to any business person that does not want the bulk of a tablet. It is almost small enough to put it in your suit coat pocket and perfect for any woman's purse.
i got this tablet for fathers day and was really excited since i don't have a smart fone and wanted to enter the world of apps. i downloaded a couple of books from kindle since the tab comes with the kindle app pre-loaded. every time i try to open the book to read it i get an error message and i can't open the books. i paid for the books and i can't read them. i can download books from other apps and they seem ok but i can't find some of the titles that are on kindle. maybe i'm doing something wrong? most of the apps i've downloaded just seem to be pieces of the website that should be the working parts. i read the reviews of the apps before i download them and 99% of the comments are from how they work on phones. i guess this tab is to new and maybe the apps are not yet updated for use on it. movies and tv shows from netflix download well. i would have given this little sammy 5 stars except for the problemi'm having with the apps.
The appeareance of this product with the combination of android is the best. The only problem with this device is the lack of processing and memory power. Android is overall better than apple due to the freedom of access. The only completeoption right now at the stores is the ipad 2 and 3, even when you have a monopolized and extremly restricted operating system, it is complete, smooth and the fastest responsiveness compared to any Android Tablet. If you are buying today I'll recomend iPad, but today Android Manufacturers (Samsung specially - the closest competitor) have a lot to equip with better hardware (Quad core over 1.5GHz CPUs, 2GB RAM, Full HD displays), to be able to perform above iPads. I'm going back to Apple because because it is better than Android, but because the lack of competion (Responsiveness, Quality, Performance).
My aunt recently purchased this for me, its amazing. I love it I totally would tell all my friends to get this!!!
I love my new tablet. It is small enough to take everywhere, but the screen is large enough that you can easily see everything. I think the camera takes great pictures. I love that it uses the android market. It is fast and it was not expensive.
This is my first tablet. I was considering getting either this or the Kindle Fire, but I decided that I wanted the tablet that I might not outgrow as quickly as I tend to outgrow electronics. Overall, I'm very happy with it doing the things I do, like ebook reading, playing games and internet browsing. I do some video streaming. As of now, Hulu Plus isn't compatible with this tablet, so I use crackle and netflix or the xfinity apps to watch tv shows. There's a good deal of bloatware on here, a good deal of it is there so you can use your tablet in conjunction with your Samsung smart tv. But since my tv is still a "dumb" tv, apps like Allshare and Peel aren't useful to me. There are also apps for use if you purchase music, books and games directly from Samsung... All in all, however, I'm very glad I decided on this tablet rather than the Kindle Fire.
The Galaxy Tab 2 is a nice tablet. I added a 16 GB micro sd card with music,pictures, and movies on it. This unit didn't skip a beat and played all the media . It is very responsive to the touch and has plenty of processing power for everything my wife does. My grandson and her take turns playing songs they like and it is cute to watch them. The only drawback is the battery life is only about 5 hours with wifi on.
I just can't seem to put it down! My sister makes fun of me because she says it looks like a really big cellphone but then brags about how shes going to get one herself! Everyone that has seen it tells me they want one because it's just really worth the money and all around everything you need in a tablet! It's really lightweight so it goes with me everywhere, I don't have to carry my laptop around for school anymore (unless I have papers to type up, which on the tab might be a tad difficult to do), I just take this with me and with the use of some pretty handy apps, I can save my docs online and send them to the printer at work or school wirelessly. If you are trying to decide on a tablet I would definitely recommend the Galaxy Tab 2 7.0, well worth your money!
I wanted to get a 7 inch tablet for Drawing, Reading Books and Comics, and Playing MP3's. The Samsung Galaxy 2 7 was pretty much a computer in your hand as far as everything goes. Until I tried Drawing with it. Lines with both my finger and with a stylus were wavy. Especially, when drawing diagonally. If you are not into drawing, this would be a great tablet.
My daughter loves it...I have difficulty typing on it....doesn't react to my touch as well as hers. Otherwise, great picture quality. Small, Light, Thin....works well for travelers.
I had a kindle fire and after playing with this one in the store and noticing the speed difference and vibrant screen for movie watching, I sold the kindle fire and brought this one. Best thing i did.
Works well for reading books and playing games. Small size makes it easy to take on the go.
Bought this for my mother to replace her unused laptop. It does what it is supposed to do. Great combination of features and price.
My wife and I purchased this to have games and apps for the kids at dinner and when we are watching them play at MC Donalds. This thing is a joke. It won't connect to any WiFi ( yes you techs I checked the settings ) . And to sync to the computers and put some music on for the kids forget it, it goes from sync to home screen to sync and you cannot delete anything! I will NEVER buy this type of junk again! I am so upset that the geek squad recommend this. Stay away buy IPAD only!!!
Has too many default internet settings which are hard to navigate around but once you finally get the url you want it works okay.
Plug and play simplicity with great battery life. Comfortable size and has intuitive navagation. Only problem is not being able to download iTunes. I still give it a 5.
First thing first, thank you Samsung for EXTERNAL-SD capabilities. Got a 32 Mini-sd and works without problems. I am using this as an integrated GPS/Entertainment system with my stock car - 2010 Kia Soul. WiFi works great and never looses signal. Tethered with my Samsung Epic 4g when on the road. Stock Video Player rocks. No longer need RockPlayer Lite (great app if you got other android OS). Plays my 720 mkv files with no lag. True HD capabilities. Tablet works great with Sygic (offline Maps) and Torque(Engine Management App). Don't have problems connecting multiple Bluetooth devices at one. I have the ODBII Bluetooth adapter, Mini BT keyboard w. mouse, Scosche Motormouth 2 all connected at once. Another plus - ever since the first Galaxy Tab 1 - Samsung got the HID drivers built in. No problem with my mini keyboard with touchpad. MOUSE actually works with no problems and a cursor actually is on the screen. Was really debating over either the Lenovo A1 (offline GPS), BB Playbook 16G (since it has Android apps now) or even the Acer Iconia 7". But I think this was the best decision since all those were in the same price range. I love the feel of almost stock ICS. Future mods in the future = going root and adding a custom ROM to get rid of the bloatware.
Nice Tab, but Android System takes some time to learn. Some of the icons are difficult to "tap" actuate.
This is a great tablet for travelling. I have to travel a lot for my job and the tablet is smaller and doesn't take up much room. Before I leave, I load a movie to watch on the plane and I also load a book to read. Movie quality is very good and the sound is great for both movies and music.
I absolutely am in love with this tablet. It has full gps capability. GREAT fast and accurate accelarameter. Auto brightness....high resolution. Gradients are not a problem for this tablet. Panaramic pictures. TV remote thru infra red port. Well worth the money. I highly recommend it.
I've had this for two months now. the only thing i don't like about it, is the computer interface. I have an apple computer and i had to download a app just so I can download movies and music to the external sd card, or to access the internal drive. a lot of time it force quits when linking to my computer. i find i have to unmount and move the sd card to my computer to download stuff. I never had this problem with any other android device I've own. Also if you use the tablet for long periods of time. it tends to over heat where the sd card is. Other than that. the tablet is great.
When my younger daughter got her iPad, I saw the intrigue of the tablet computer. Most everything that one does on their pc or laptop can be achieved on the device in a most convenient fashion. Still, the iPad is larger than what might be workable for me. So, I decided to purchase the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7.0 with 8GB Memory - Titanium Silver. I am glad I made that choice. It is easy to use and lightening fast on the internet. I now have all of the news, my email, Facebook, Netflix... everything I love about the web, at my fingertips. And the size of the device is absolutely perfect, rendering it light weight and easy to use. Add a mobile hotspot and you can kiss boredom on a car trip good bye. And you have an outstanding GPS. I cannot sing the praises of this tablet enough. It was the best decision ever in an electronics purchase and I recommend it highly.
This tablet is basically a computer I bought and it has been everything I had wanted. it is really fast and can be customized more than any iPad.
Before I purchased the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7.0, I owned a Blackberry PlayBook. While it was reliable and easy to use, the app selection was sparse. So I sold my PlayBook and picked up the Tab 2 7.0. I was immediately impressed. The construction of the Tab 2 7.0 felt strong and firm and didn't feel cheap, even though the body is made of plastic, and thankfully Samsung didn't make a plastic display instead of glass, looking at the price tag. The Tab 2 7.0 felt speedy and smooth when navigating the home screen and app menu. There was little lag. The Tab 2 7.0 comes with Android 4.0.3, aka Ice Cream Sandwich, which looks visually similar to 3.0 Honeycomb, but it has Samsung's TouchWiz interface, which luckily is a lot more improved than earlier versions but it may be an issue if you want the closest thing to stock Android. So far I haven't had any software issues, except for a rare case when the widgets got visually glitched with stretched text and images, but this has only happened once. It has a dual-core 1GHz processor, a bit behind for today's standards, but it was still good enough to get the job done quickly. 1024x600 is the screen resolution, typical for a 7in tablet, but it looked clearer and more vibrant than other 7in tablets. Videos looked good and audio was surprisingly good as well. The rear camera took decent photos for being only 3MP, but I never intended to use the tablet for taking pictures anyways. Battery life is very good as well. I got 10 hours of life before recharging, with WiFi on and screen brightness set to automatic. The Tab 2 7.0 only has 8GB of memory, with about 4.6GB usable, but it has a microSD slot so it was no big deal, just put videos and music on the microSD card and use the internal memory for apps. I also am using it as an e-reader to replace my Nook Color and text looks sharp and clear, even at small text sizes (using Nook app). The app selection is decent, and the screen is small enough that even phone-based apps look decent, but as big as tablet apps for the iPad, but someday Android will catch up. Overall, the Tab 2 7.0 has won my vote for best 7in tablet to date, even though it doesn't have much competition at that size. Recommended for someone who wants a good, solid Android tablet, but is also budget conscience.
I like soo much my tab because is easy to use, the size is perfect to take it anywhere.....my daughters love it to play and learn....at the begining I was tinking to buy the Blackberry tab but at final I decided to the SAMSUMG GALAXY because the galaxy have OS Android and you have access to a lot applications......the better is the screen resolution, the pictures and videos in HD looks amazing........
Worth the money, Very responsive and easy to use but downloaded apps default to home screen.
This was my first tablet. To be honest, I was looking for something that would let me stay in touch while I do some travelling (twitter, im, email), and some casual gaming. Didn't think I'd need a lot of memory, since this isn't my main computer, and I was right. I've been very happy so far. It was easy to set up, find my apps of choice, and get going. The only problem I've had is getting it to connect to my secured network at home. If the network is open - no problems connecting. Definitely get the screen protector. Learned that fast enough. Should have got it at the same time, but didn't think how necessary it would be.
I would purchase this again, did my due diligence and it has held up to the hype. Only $249, great deal and just as good as the more expensive tablets. The 7" is the perfect size, the 10" tablets are to bulky, this fits in most pockets.
think it's a great product and i'm really having fun with it
This tablet has plenty of power, easy to use and probably will replace my laptop.
I love this tablet over my iPad. Good size to carry and better compatibility first of all. It can read most types of video and music fines. With additional 32GB microSD card this perfectly serves my needs. I gave my iPad to my kids.
I have done my research on many tablets and used friends tablets and Ipads over the last few years and the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7.0 offers everything I liked but without all the thing i didn't. The size is perfect for me, I wouldn't want anything bigger. I love the fact that I have access to the android marketplace and the amazon market, they both offer a tone of free apps. The fact that it had expandable memory was a plus as well, I have a ton of ebooks ,ecomics and movies that I threw on my 32gb micro sd. The screen looks awesome and the speed is great I have yet to notice any lag on any of the apps I use. I have talked a few people into going with the android based tab over the Ipad by showing them how customizable it is. A friend that is a long time mac guy was very impressed with it and prefers the 7.0 size over the 10in Ipad. The only issues I have would be the battery life could be a little better (dont get me wrong its very good I get about a day and a half) and the fact that I cant move apps over to the sd card kind of bothers me but I hear is a flaw with ICS.
We have an iPad 2 and now this, only bought this because of it size and the fact that I wanted to see if this was any better than the iPad. And the answer to that is no way! I got this for my wife so she would stop using my ipad! She hates this and still prefers to use my iPad. Wish I had spent the extra $100 and got another iPad 2. About the same speed as my older iPad 1.0
I love this tablet. I really like the fact that it comes with a sandisk slot. So it's really nice to know that I can expand the memory. Apps are easy to download and download pretty fast. I've watched movies on here and I was first concenrn that the tablet would be too small to watch movies compared to the 10.1 inch tablet but that was not the case. The movie was clear and big enough. I prefer this tablet over the 10.1 or the Ipad mainly due to size. I just don't want to carry something so big. This is perfect. I can read my kindle books, play games while on the train, and watch movies. So far so good. Personally I like the andriod operating system. I have an iphone and my husband have the samsung galaxy nexus phone and I love the way his phone operates so that was another reason why I chose to go with the samsung galaxy tablet over the Ipad. When I'm due for a new phone, I'm probably definitely going to go with andrioid. Also, price was a big factor too. You really can't beat $250 compared to$500-$700 for an ipad or other tablets.
I like it! It is easy to use and it has that expandable memory which I think is a rip off on the I-pad/pods.
You can't go wrong with this tablet. Takes beautiful pictures and video even though it has no flash. The colors on the screen are beatiful. I have an iPad2 and thought it was a bit too large to drag around with me......this is the tablet that goes everywhere. It far beyond the other tablets of its size and you can't beat the price!
I really like this and take it everywhere with me. Very user friendly. I keep a calendar on it, use it for photos all the time, access the net, let my kids play games on it, read books - very inexpensive comparitively and really useful!!
I've had few issues with this tablet. Battery life has been fine for my functions (email, web browsing, app usage, using as a reader). I haven't watched full length videos on it yet, so I can't judge on that, but overall it's a decent little machine. Standard keyboard is awful for touch response and intuitiveness which really is essential on a touch screen no matter how good a typist you are. And I would appreciate better pc to tablet sincing particularly with ebooks and their apps. Samsung's kies does not currently support ebooks transfers, and it leaves me with a rather convoluted way of moving the files over. Would like more accessory options, but overall for price and function it's great.
I have turned my tablet into a sort of mega ipod touch with the use of a 32GB micro sd and doubletwist air sync (usb sync does not work with ICS) right to my sd. Ice cream sandwich is great, processing power is sufficient, and so is battery life. All in all for $250 I don't think you will find more value in a tablet.
I love this tablet!!! I bought it for my boyfriend as a graduation gift and we both use it for games, netflix, and the internet. Watching netflix on it is like watching it on a HD tv in my opinion. I do use it a lot and have to charge it a least half way through the day. A lot of down time at work and school that I use this to pass the time.
I got this tablet (for about $250) about a month ago. I was looking at a kindle or nook color/tablet, but when I played with them in the store the Galaxy seemed to be more responsive to the touch. That being said, I am not familiar with touch screens (and really don't like them, which is why I put off buying a tablet). I'm still having a hard time hitting the right keys on the keypad and clicking the right spot when I want to navigate. I am also unfamiliar with apps, so I haven't downloaded many, and seldom use the ones I have. I just need to work with it more to get the most out of the tablet, but I seems to offer a lot for such a small unit. I chose the 7" tablet because it's easier to carry than a 10" (I can put the 7" in my purse, which wouldn't be possible with a 10"), yet it's large enough to read - I can't stand trying to read email (or anything else) on a phone!!! I have a 10" netbook - which is old, but I love it! - so I'll continue to use that if I need portabitiy when I need to do actual work. But for email, web surfing, and reading on the go, this unit is great. I took it on vacation last week, along with a mobile wifi unit, and was able to catch up with the rest of the world while on the go.
Perfect tablet for quality and cost conscious. I recommend the Galaxy Tab 2 7.0.
Really good tablet for the price.... I wish samsung would update the firmware so that you can move apps to the sd card. It only has 8 gb of internal memory, which about half of that is used for the operating system.... so really you only have a little over 4 gb available. You can put data on the sd card which helps some. Data being...... music, book, and videos..... I still would recommend this tablet....... I tried the bigger sizes at the store, but felt like they were awkard to hold. The 7 inch fits the hands better.
This was our 4th purchase of a 7" tablet. The first two had too many quirks, poor touch screen not able to use outdoors. The smoothest 7" tablet was the Toshiba Thrive but it too was not readable in direct sun light. Finally we purchased the Samsung Galaxy 2 7" with the ice cream operating system. The unit feels good and operates very well but still needs some tweaking with the responsiveness with the 4.0 operating system. But best of all it is bright enough to read e-books in direct sun light, where the other brands you could not. Always looking for shade. The Wifi works great, just returned from our first two week trip to Mexico and was able to download e-pub and emails flawlessly. We purchased a cover and non-glare screan protector for the Galaxy 2 and was very happy with the results. The main purpose for the purchase of the Galaxy 2 was for traveling and reading e-books without out having to lug around a bounch of paper backs. Mishion accomplished!
It's the perfect size to carry in your purse. Screen looks great the new Android 4.0 is easy to navigate.
I bought this as a gift for my wife. It works great for applications like Netflix, Skype, facebook, and general web browsing. My wife also uses it for audio books and eBooks.
I purchased the Galaxy Tab 2 7.0 for three reasons: 1) I wanted to learn the new Ice Cream Sandwich (ICS) OS (Android 4.0) as I was bored with the IPad OS and may switch to an Android phone next year (the IPhone screen is too small for me now and not a great experience any longer); 2) I wanted a smaller form factor than 10.1 inches for portability and less strain on my wrists (the IPad mini is still a rumor afterall); and 3) I wanted another tablet device as my daughter requisitioned by IPad. All three reasons were easily met by this product. ICS is fun to use and is very good once you learn it. The lighter tablet does not hurt my wrists after long periods of use, and I can carry it everywhere in my back or front pocket. My daughter (3 years old) does not even bother to touch the Galaxy Tab 7.0 as she is happy with the IPad. The lack of a home button prevents her from turning on the Galaxy Tab and playing with it, which is great and the result I was looking for. The battery life is shorter than the IPad, but since it meets my needs, it is not a big problem for me. I added movies and music to the SD memory card and now this is my "go to" device for entertainment and other content consumption, especially RSS news feeds. The sound is average, but I use headphones most of the time or pair it with a bluetooth speaker. It will definitely go with me when traveling this summer, and I will use it more for notes and .pdf and other document viewing during business meetings. I duplicated most of the IPad apps I use except for certain TV show streaming apps, but I do not miss them as I thought I would. I suggest getting a screen protector as the glass screen attracts fingerprints. Also, I added a carbon fiber textured skin to help with gripping the device. I have a case from Poetic for the tablet, but use it only when out of the house as I prefer to use the device without a case to satisfy reason #2 above. Hope this review helps you.
GOT THIS LAST WEEKEND AND I LOVE IT. IT IS NICE AND COMPACT AND GOES JUST ABOUT EVERYWHERE WITH ME INCLUDING WORK. I CAN VIEW MOVIES ON IT AND PLAY TONS OF GAMES RIGHT AT MY DESK. CAMERA COULD BE BETTER THOUGH, BUT ENJOY THE REVERSE CAMERA OPTION. IT HAS EXCELLENT SOUND FOR ITS SIZE. ITS ANDROID SO IT GOES HAND AND HAND WITH ANDROID PHONE SUCH AS THE SAMSUNG GALAXY S 2, ESPECIALLY IF YOU LIKE TO DOWNLOAD TONS OF FREE STUFF FROM THE MARKET. ITS SMALL, BUT ITS DURABLE AND WELL WORTH THE MONEY.
Samsung has blown away the competition with this little tablet. Being the fastest 7" tablet on the market and sporting the newest version of the Android Operating System "IceCreamSandwich". With a dual-core, 1Ghz processor and 1Gb of onboard storage this little tablet performs extremely well. The memory can be expanded by adding a 32GB MicroSD card for movies, music, photos or whatever else you want to store. This tablet is a great alternative to the Nook or Kindle Fire in that it has the ability to add apps for compatibility with both of their storage systems so you don't have to choose one or the other. It also has tablet features that neither of them have. The dual facing cameras are great for those who may want to Skype with family members, or take pictures/video. The high definition display is beautiful with a great response from the touch screen. Battery life is also good even with the wi-fi left on. Built in software and remote transmitter permit control of multiple devices in your home theater or living room. Simply select the devices, then go to the TV listings and select what you want to watch. The software controls turning on each device and putting it in the right mode/channel to watch your show. Better than the Logitech Harmony remotes could ever perform. For the price and features, this is not only the best value, but the best quality product on the market in 7" #or now in 10"# tablets.
Bought this tablet when it came out because I felt it was the right size, not an Apple, had the new Android Ice Cream Sandwich operating system, could expand memory to 32 GB with micro SD card and was priced at only $250. I now have downloaded books from Amazon, barrowed ebooks from library, copied a DVD to the SD card, used it for emails & text messages, surf the net, listen to my music and cancelled the newspaper since it was no longer needed. It is a little small but that is the trade off to being able to take it everywhere
This is my first tablet and being tech challenged I am just getting used to it.That said I am using mainly as an e-reader and to keep track of stormy weather at work. Once you turn on the power saving mode and get rid of the screen saver, it really burns through the battery, I have gone a day and a half almost two days w/o having to recharge the battery but I am not out and about a lot. If you are looking for a hand held PC/tablet then this is something you to look to getting. I compared the Galaxy Tab, the nook table and several others for the price, the capabilities and the variety of apps available this is your best buy, no pun intended, but you should make up your own mind and decide based on your needs.
This is my 1st tablet and performs well. Still getting used to the android system.
This is the most bulkiest of bloatware tablets I have ever seen. It was bought for use with scanning barcodes (QR) and it does NOT auto focus, which meant that it could not detect 99% of barcodes. The new OS was the best thing I could find about this cheap tablet. Spend an extra $100 bucks and get a real tablet that can actually do something....
Ok people, I really wanted to like this device. After trying the Blackberry Playbook (which at $199 is still a great device if you can live with Blackberry's app selection) I had to give this a try because it was running Android 4.0 (ICS) and seemed to have more features (GPS, Apps, Infrared, not Blackberry). And at first it was fun. Immediately after entering your gmail account your previously purchased apps download. Nice. Then they start to update... and Google Play has some type of glitch that loops the update screen and you pretty much have to task kill Google Play to get it to stop. Ok, annoying but I found a work around. Wait, SimCity won't play on this? What Hulu Plus doesn't support this device? I'm stuck with Netflix as a built in app? I'm stuck with your TouchWiz interface and un-removeable software like that bottom tray of not-so-handy apps. Like the Email Pop-up that has never worked and gives me a "Service has stopped responding" error? EVERYTIME. Like your Movie Maker software that crashes when rendering a video and forgets to add the transition affects - EVERYTIME. And this just happened way to often to ignore... yes it will require a double or triple tap every now and again to get things to respond. What version of Android is this? 4.0 and you guys still have problems with Capacitive touch? My Droid Razr performs FAR better than this. And speaking of performance... Marginal and best. Grand Theft Auto III - Good luck. Try walking into an ally full of thugs and you can count the Frame Rate. Finally, there's build quality. My unit seems to have "loosened up" over the last 3 weeks and now I hear/feel plastic creaking noise when I grab the tab at various spots around the edge. Like the plastic back has separated from the unit although there are no visible signs of this). Very concerning. And when you consider the unit heats up quite a bit while charging and watching a movie - my confidence that this product will last is very small. And could you put the power button in a more annoying place? NO. And so... back to BestBuy it goes. And I welcome something I've resisted for years - buying an iPad (or any apple product for that matter). Because quite simply, nothing, and I mean NOTHING, compares to it. At $399 for the iPad 2, this will be a choice I never look back on. Good luck to everyone else. Maybe mine was glitchy and your's will be fine.
I bought this tablet for myself. I wanted something inexpensive, in the 7" form factor, and not tethered to Amazon or Barnes & Noble, this fits the bill perfectly. For computer novices, this is not as simple to use as an ipad and the apps are definitely much more limited than for Apple. On the other hand, you can comfortably hold this tablet in one hand, the battery life is great, it plays flash videos, and it can access just about any content available on the internet (except Apple, of course).
A lot of features and quality for the low price. Easier to handle than a 10-inch tablet.
Purchased this over the memorial weekend. works fast and quality of screen is very good. Tried to watch different videos from utube etc always would freeze. After the 3rd day the tablet started to run slower Returned to Best Buy
I wanted a tablet and thought that a small 7" one would have the benefit of portability (it could actually fit in my jacket pocket) to extend its usefulness. If you're after portability and want good screen image, features (Ice Cream Sandwich operating system), and speed, this will fit the bill. I determined that I needed more. I need a larger screen (10") and some other nice things that my next unit had to offer. It was orders of magnitude beyond the "not so bad" Galaxy Tab 2 7". It was an Asus TF 300, the latest model, and while it is more expensive, it has the virtue of an optional attached keyboard/docking station that adds amazing things. The physical keyboard is great in itself, and it's a good one for its size. In addition, it has its own battery that will extend the total battery life to about twice what it would be with just the tablet. Plus, it has another SD card expansion slot up to 32 GB, which would be on top of the one in the tablet itself for up to 32GB. But the incredible thing is the full size USB port, where you can attach things such as an external hard drive for virtually unlimited storage of music, photos, and video. So with all this, I viewed the ASUS TF 300 as ideal, with one exception. The one exception has to do with screen resolution. The iPad has been increasing screen resolution to the point where Android tablets need to play catch-up. That's where the ASUS TF 700 comes in. To be released in the June/July timeframe, it is supposed to be the 300 on screen steroids, with a full hi-definition resolution. It's hard to justify keeping the 300 with an already fine resolution, similar to the resolution of the 7" tablet that is the subject of this review, when I'm only within a month or two of having it all. So, to summarize, if you want a smaller, 7" tablet, the Galaxy Tab 2 is a fine selection, but your needs would be completely different from my needs for the ASUS 10". If portability is at the top of your list, then seriously consider the Galaxy Tab 2.
I have been debating to purchasing a tablet for my soon to be 7 yrs. old daughter. For several weeks I have been reading and comparing reviews on several tablet within its price range $150-300. Newest Android 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich) is a plus with all new apps being developed, 7" screen is suitable for daily use, sharp graphics, decent processor speed, battery life+++ and its sleek design. Plenty of accessories. Can't go wrong... In the future, Samsung should consider upgrading its camera feature. At least an 8.0MP will work better! But will highly recommend this product!
Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7.0 with 8GB Memory - Titanium Silver, is great! for the low price I get everything I needed in a touch pad. It is very easy to carry around. My wife keep it in her purse everywhere she goes. For guys we can hold the device in one hand so it is very good for watching movies.
I wanted something that was easy to use and transport. I found my netbook to be cumbersome even at it's small size and even though the netbook is more powerful I find the Tab is handling everything I ask from it so far. I was looking at the kindle fire as well and found for my needs the Tab was the better choice and Android has a kindle app which works fine. The kindle was far heavier and slower to process information compared to the Tab. The Tab also has a micro-SD slot which the kindle doesn't have. Good unit and I was not disappointed buying the TAB!
I love my Galaxy Tab 2. The 7" size is perfect and I can put it right in my purse. This is my first tablet and I'm still figuring out how the mobile apps work. Any problems I've encountered thus far are probably caused more by user error than anything else :-)
The product is physically beautiful and the display is really amazing but it uses a Samsung proprietary connector for charging instead of the more common micro USB. That means that you have to buy new cables to use when charging in the car, etc. and one additional cable if you are traveling with a Blackberry, Kindle, etc. Also - Hulu Plus is not supported on this (or any) Samsung device at this point so I ended up bringing it back to the store
Great tablet, ICS runs flawless and all the apps run great. Easy to put movies or music on, expansion slot for micro sd card is great. All around tremendous tablet for any use.
I really was not that impressed with this device. The speed was OK but the 7" screen is just too small for my liking. I return the unit.
I got this tablet two days ago for my 13th birthday ,and so far i love it. It's good for gaming and videos. You can also control your television with smart peel. This device can download tv shows and stream them any where (even with out wifi, 3g or 4g service). Also it can do much more than the IPAD. The 2 thing that bother me the most are the speed and controls. This device also has good sound quality. THIS TABLET IS A GOOD TABLET FOR TEENS, KIDS OR EVEN ADULTS!
Quick and easy to setup. Purchased primarily for a 4 year old. The kid loves it. The adults enjoy it just as much.
Very Portable tablet, useful, fun eassier to use than a smartphone with all the features you could want.
1GB and 512MB ram is a little too slow for me. However, you get what you paid for.
Great price for a tablet. This my first one I have ever bought. Keep in mind that this will not compared to the 10" models but for the size of this tablet, it's a competitor. Loved it so much bought a second one for the wife! Also, tablets are not cameras so not having a flash isn't a big concern for me.
I just bought this Tablet last week. I got all caught up in the hype and figured I have to have one. It does live up to what they say. Nice picture and the 7" size is just right. I wish the case was a little heavier. Here is the deal though. I thought that I would find myself doing more on it that I already wasn't doing. I found myself doing exactly the same things I can do on my smart phone, DROID X. Basically this is just an oversized smart phone, minus the phone. I really think that is the case with any of these tablets, including an IPAD. Sure youi can watch movies, but thats not free and who does that when you have a 40" LED at home. The Tab 2 can be used as a remote for your TV, but I already have a remote. It can take pictures, but really, who is going to take a tablet on vacation to take pictures. My phone has a better camera. So ask your self, "What will a tablet do that I can't already do?"
This is my first tablet. And though I plan on buying the project Fiona for gaming, this one suits me just fine for now. Ics is great and a really refreshing interface. the tab itself is nice to hold and very sleek. Fingerprints are not noticeble during use. i would reccomend this to anyone. If you plan on typing a lot, i suggest gettig the dock which i believe is about 50 bucks.
I've owned 4 other seven inch tablet's before this one and this is by far the best. I run custom roms on everything I own. This has a great developer community behind it already and it's still new. Buy this tablet, you won't regret it.
I am guessing you are not thinking about buying this 7" tablet to surf the internet or to read email, you can do that on your smart phone already. So the only thing left is to play games and watch movies. You can play games just fine on this tiny tablet but you will NOT be able to watch every video format. This tablet refuses to play Quicktime movies from the Internet. It seems to block them. Cannot play Hulu and there is no HBO app for Android, so forget about watching TV episodes online in most websites. It does not play videos from DSLR cameras shot in 720p or 1080p. Basically it only plays extremely low resolution videos like a smart phone. So the only use of this tablet is for playing Android games nothing else.
This is a great tablet. I have tried alot of tablets and love the 7 inch size. I bought the 10.1 but was not happy with it. This is fast, great apps and ICS is easy to use. I also have the 7.0 plus tablet and wouldnot trade foran ipad. Ifyou are an android lover like me you should try these tablets.
This is my first Android tablet, 7". I have an Android smartphone, DroidX. I was curious to know if I would like the touch operating system interface and could adapt to it. It took only a few sessions with the tablet to learn where the apps, gadgets, and menus were and how to get them where I could access them quickly. Learning was very quick from there; soon I was uploading and downloading to my Google Drive, both photos and documents. Apps for document editing/creating and photo editing are preloaded, as well as Kindle and Google's own store applications. I bought a 16GB MicroSD card to supplement the 8GB onboard memory so I could download large media files. Unfortunately the door for the card is very fragile and I bent it to far. It closes okay now, but initially I had to tape it closed. The NetFlix demo worked well. I had been looking at the Kindle Fire, but for $50 more I got a full computer with Kindle app included. Buyers need to download the Users Manual from Samsung to learn some functions, but most of the user interface is intuitive to touch-hold-swipe. I bought a 7" case for a stand, similar to ones for 10.1" models, but it is still stiff and I use a book reading stand for vertical viewing. The foldup Freedom Pro Bluetooth keyboard I use for my DroidX syncs very quickly with the Samsung tablet. Since the tablet is a Samsung it interfaces well with my Samsung Blu-Ray player so I can pipe media to my plasma TV using the AllShare app. Next I plan to buy Bluetooth stereo headset for the tablet, which should also work with my DroidX.
Bought this product for my daughter's 13th birthday and she loves it. All she really wanted was a cell phone and we got this instead and she absolutely loves it. She doesn't even want a cell phone now. She can text through our WiFi easily without cost.
Debuting at ~250$ plus tax, this is tablet is steal at launch. Best tablet I have ever owned. The combination of small form factor and light weight make it possible to stuff into your pocket and a pleasure to hold with one or both hands, even for longer periods of time. A perfect attention waster for long waiting rooms visits, or a lazy day of fun. The WiFi is noticeably stronger than on other similar devices I've frequently used, Galaxy Tab 10.1, iPhone 4, and a few others. This tablet has reintroduced me to reading, both books and comics. Though I am an IT person, I had avoided the eBook format, always in favor of traditional, paper books. No more! Several simple and easy to use eBook apps let you quickly purchase and read official content without confusion. I personally use only the Amazon Kindle reader app that I believe is pre-installed. It has smooth page transitions, excellent text legibility and a built in dictionary for painlessly taming "Game of Thrones" and other titles with large vocabularies. For "unofficial" eBook and comic downloads, you can find many apps in the Play Store. I personally use "ComicRack" mostly for reading the various comics I have downloaded on my PC. To transfer the files to my PC I use "WiFi File Explorer", another Play Store app. Once the comic files are on the PC, the ComicRack app locates them automatically and populates your library. An amazing experience and a tremendous value, I read every issue of "The Walking Dead" for the price of the app. Certainly cannot do this on the iPad without tremendously greater effort as iOS does not allow direct access to the internal storage of the device without the use of iTunes. Building on those points, Google Music is just great. Upload any MP3 you've ever downloaded on your PC and you can stream to any Android device you own, also for free. Gaming is surprisingly good, very little slowdown on most games. I haven't played many actual Android games, but I have emulators for the SNES, Genesis, PS One, and Neo-Geo/MAME, specifically I use SuperGNES, GENPLUSDroid, FPse, and NEO.emu respectively. At first I made due with the touch screen controls, but after dying many, many times in Zelda, it was decided a Bluetooth controller would be the solution. After much effort and three different controller attempts, I finally was able to successfully connect and use a Wii controller to play games. The app "Wiimote Controller" allowed me to manually connect to the MAC address of the Wiimote, I used the app "Bluetooth Address Finder" to get the Wiimote's address for the manual connection. When gaming, I hold the crazy Wiimote sideways and pretend it's an NES controller. Works amazingly well and allows for a very enjoyable gaming experience for hours, especially if you cover the annoying Wiimote's flashing lights with a sticker or something. I feel as though I have discovered a treasure trove of games. For the price of the emulator apps listed above, and a few hours downloading and uploading ROMs, you can basically play almost every game ever made on all those systems for a ridiculously low price. Also, the built in speaker allows for very decent sound, certainly meets the needs of the emulators and streaming video. Android 4.0 is a vast improvement over Android 3.x Honeycomb, and light years ahead of Android 2.x Gingerbread. In comparison to iOS 5, in my opinion, Android 4.0 allows for much more functionality for much less money, without sacrificing too much of the sleek responsiveness that has made iOS popular. Once you've done the many fun things listed in the paragraphs above without any special processes or paying 100+$ in apps, it will be clear why Android exists and may change your opinion of the two big players offerings. Then, stop to contemplate that Windows 8 on the horizon.. Performance is a mixed bag on this device. Android 4.0 ICS is a snappy, responsive operating system, but the processor of the tablet is a 1.0 GHz dual core that doesn't always make for the best speed when the OS has its occasional un-cached process, or does anything really demanding, like unzipping a file. Though I have no problem playing games, sometimes I feel it would be nice to have more power, like the quad core in the S3, or the Tegra 3 in Asus's offering. But it is times like this to remember the price tag, and that this device in available. And finally my negative points. The screen is not fantastic, it does the job and looks good when watching HD quality video, but when reading very small text on website, without zooming, it can get a little jaggy. Also battery life is not terrible, but not so great, I usually last about 6 hours in between charges. I think I am overly demanding in both of these cases, but even so, if this device had 50% more battery life and an AMOLED or better display at 720p+ resolution it would be unstoppable. In the end, I highly recommend this tablet. For now it is the clear winner overall in the tablet game. -Tom
The device is ok for the money and comes with a good set of tools that can be used for basic task. The size is perfect to carry around work or for personal use. However, if you are somebody that is a power user and expects the device to respond to your every need in a split second, stay away from it. You will need a tablet with a better processor and a lot more power for that. That is exactly what I did kept my big tablet for power jobs and use this one for quick and simple task.
The device is great. Good price point and good set of features . Works well with a Galaxy So acting as a hotspots. Integrates brilliantly with wifi network structure accessing the network hard drives for movies. The home screen is slightly annoying in that it doesn't fill the whole screen. The display is bright and vibrant but a little reflective . The BIG thing is that it scratches easily. Not like the S2! The size is perfect for holding to read books or PDF.
Yes, the device is small but I was looking for something similar to the ipod 4th gen capabilities. I liked the size of this device as it is larger and it certainly offers everything I need for traveling without the need to carry my netbook or laptop. I love the ease also of reading a book while listening to my music. The gps function is slick but I haven't figured out any other way to get my route other than when I am connected to the internet first. The route is saved and the gps function tracks me on the map but doesn't change the route if I move away from the planned route. With that being said, it is a great device for my purposes anyway. The tv remote function works okay but needs some improvement. I really like seeing all of the shows on the remote screen and then seeing the channel and either manually puting them in or pushing the quick button (doesn't always work the best).
This tablet does everything well and it is quality built. It is very responsive and the picture is impressive. It includes a video maker as well as picture editor so this tab just might be able to replace that desktop pc. It is great for all the things i needed it for such as emailing,internet browsing,music,videos...At only $250.00 this is a great deal as I know this tab 2 is just as good, if not better than even pricier tablets.
I was happy seeing this tab and was excited in buying it. There is a huge problem in having to transfer files/applications into your memory card. I bought a 16 gb knowing that the internal memory is only 8gb for additional storage but it ended up to be useless. There is no option of transferring application downloads into the memory card to begin with. All the downloaded files like pictures and videos does not allow you to save it into your memory card. What is the use of having a memory card that you can only use for when you take picture from the tablet??? Occasionally the system freeze while on the web. Very disappointed, returning it to BB.
Samsung has made quality hardware for $250. The product has solid build quality, and has really good specs for its price. Battery life, RAM, CPU, and screen are the best for the price point. The software sucks though. Android is not designed to optimally utilize the hardware. No matter how much RAM, CPU power you put to run it, the animations are always jerky, which spoils the experience of using the tablet. 1GB RAM and 1GHz dual core processor is pretty good in terms of the power, but Android cannot use it optimally. iPad uses almost the same specs, and runs smoothly. The product will do what it is supposed to do, without any wow factor.
I have the new iPad which I use for everything and absolutely love. I read a lot of ebooks and wanted something smaller that I could carry with me and that I could hold with one hand while reading. I wasn't looking for an iPad replacement; rather, I wanted an ereader. I debated the nook tablet and kindle fire and actually went to best buy to buy the fire, when I saw the galaxy tab 2 I decided for an extra $50 I could have a real android tablet instead of the hacked interface of the fire. It was a no brainer - a full fledged tablet that had ICS and met my requirement of functioning as an ereader with the kindle and nook apps. I sideload many of my ebooks and it is easy to sideload into either app (kindle for mobi and nook for epubs). The web browsing is sufficient, although I find the small keyboard to be a challenge with the size of my fingers. My only criticism is the battery life. One evening spent reading and doing some web browsing and the tablet needs to be recharged. All in all a good value for the money. This is NOT an iPad replacement. It was intended as a BUDGET tablet to compete with the Nook Tablet and Kindle Fire. If you want an iPad save your money and buy an iPad...if you want something to supplement an iPad or something that will let you run apps from Google Play, surf the web and read books then this is a great buy. Would I recommend it - without a doubt. I would suggest though that you first define what it is that you want to do with your tablet before deciding if this will meet your needs. In my case it absolutely meets them but I had a specific reason for wanting a 7 inch tablet. I realize that having both this and a new iPad might be out of many peoples' budgets but if you are able to swing it between the two you will have the best of all possible worlds when it comes to tablet computing.
Beautiful Display and an excelllent price. My main complaint is that that you can not save to the sd card by default. Went into the browser settings and set it to save downloads to sd card and it did not work. So I had to manually copy to the sd card everytime I downloaded something. Which is a big headache,since out of the box you actually only have 4gb on the device, which is very little available space.
Review of Samsung Tab 2, 7" 5/3/2012 here are some prelim thoughts about the sammy tab 2 7" -need to learn ICS.. quite different from GB... kind of a learning curve -wifi doesnt work at starbucks but that seems to be a SB issue cuz the tab and wifi work fine at home -beautiful screen -runs smooth -its a good size but heavier than i thought -it makes my phone feel small haha -can use as a TV remote stars graphics 5 speed 4 weight 3 set up 3/5 ICS 3 smoothness 5 stock apps 5 best buy experience 4 size 5 do i LOVE it? not really but i think my hopes and they hype was so high.. prolly be like my phone i didnt LOVE it at first but now i do..
Wow, Samsung nailed this design. I heard about it online, more of a surprise. Went to a few stores and even BB was sold out so fast! This is a smaller tablet that you can really take with you and it does everything android ICS 4.0 does. I've got a bunch of other tablets, and have even owned cheap ones and even ipads. I've stuck with my transformer because it gave the best experience out of everything. This is a smaller tablet that has a lot of horsepower! Portable, great battery life, great screen! The PEEL app for changing tv channels or your cable box, just amazing! This is where I wanted cell phones to go with IR control, but nobody did that without add-ons or additional software purchasing. Manu's should take note of the IR control! Cons are probably the proprietary connector and 2.0 Amp charging plug, but nothing you can't work around for this amazing device! For the price point, it's just amazing. And the Wolfram or whatever chip is inside that audiophiles love to e-debate about, too! Sound is great on this device! I got one at lunch, showed it to a few friends, one of them ran out after work and got one that same day. He was showing everyone around the office his the next day :)
Has everything I want in a tablet at the right price. Front facing camera lets me use Skype, Hangout and other video call apps. GPS allows navigation. Screen is great and doesn't feel like a cheap model where you have to hold at a certain angle to view it properly Speakers are great, which along with the great screen makes for a great movie watching experience Form factor is perfect as it slips in my pocket IR blaster makes for a great universal remote Price is perfect
This was a present for my wife. The blind leading the blind. Too bad trial & error. It is not a bad product. Manual is now available :http://downloadcenter.samsung.com/content/UM/201204/20120427002407751/Generic_Wi-Fi_GT-P3113_Galaxy_Tab_2_English_User_Manual_LD3_F3.pdf. all 200 200+ pages. Not as intuitive as ipod 2nd gen. But much faster. We yelled at each other as screen dimmed to unreadable. Fixed that ,disable auto brightness. G-mail set up her e-mail program was simple. I still have not be able to set up my microsoft email. But it will be hers not mine. So much frustration for non android user I'm tending to return it and wait for 7" Ipad. Apple would be dumb not to enter this market as the 7" size is great. 10" is too big.Internet speed is amazing so is presentation, only wish I could delete most viewed pages. Her call to keep it. Laptop is so much easier for her to use.For example delete key &go key are too close together.
Having had previous Galaxy Tabs, I must admit that this one seems a giant step backwards. My last one was 16GB with a functioning SD Micro Card slot. This unit has only 8GB and the SD card is not recognized and even thought it boasts that the slot can accomodate a 32GB card, it is useless since apps cannot be moved to the SD card. In short, you have an 8GB tablet. (Please do Google this problem to see if it has somehow been corrected by Samsung after reading this. As of the date of posting, it has not been corrected, leaving a lot of unhappy campers out there with the new Samsung tablet.) After having used an iPad and a 16GB Galaxy Tab, this one is a huge let down. Fix that SD Micro card problem and my rating would instantly jump to 4 stars. I would have expected at least 32GB and a much better camera but it appears Samsung has elected to go toward the low-end reader buyers rather than the tablet market.
All in all very good product one problem cant save apps to external sd card so 8 gb is it
I needed a tablet to take along on trekking journeys. This to hold all field guides, maps (topo and street), books and various entertainment files. I bought the Nook Tablet first and it was great but it couldn't do topo's, No app compatibility. Didn't really care about no GPS, just wanted maps. Returned the Nook Tablet and bought this Tab 2 7.0. This tablet is perfect for my needs. Longer battery life than the NT or Fire, has the hardware cams, GPS, is lighter and the sound is twice as loud. Loading topo apps is a breeze. No messy rooting (even when rooted the Nook Tab wouldn't do topo apps (the Fire can#). I just have to settle for a less than optimal reader now #the Nook Tab is far and above the Tab 2 7.0 in this role). Bought it today, loaded a Topo GPS app, and was hiking with it within an hour. Yep, just what I needed. Get a Pelican 1055 for weatherproof and submersible protection.
I just bought this yesterday and i have been having trouble setting wifi. I have a strong signal at home , but it shows poor signal on my tablet. I am returning this to get a new one , hopefully thats it , just one piece issue.
Purchased: 4/22/2012 Location: Algonquin, IL Best Buy I was a bit weary of this tablet running a Texas Instruments OMAP chip and not Samsung's Exynos, but then again, the Galaxy Nexus is running OMAP and that is Google's current flagship phone. I really like Exynos. At any rate, the Galaxy Tab 2 passed /my/ test with flying colors, or it was the OMAP that actually passed the test. What would that test be? It plays my ripped blu-ray movies like a champ. They are encoded in high profile 1080p. This is something that other chips struggle with, except for Exynos. Tegra 2 is the worst for this. Playback of this video is very fluid on the Galaxy Tab 2. Sure, it does not have a HD display, but then again it was $250. The picture is still great. Anyone who has intimate knowledge of Android knows that stock builds are usually a little sluggish, etc. We always hope for the developers to cook up some nice, debloated, and speedy ROMS. I am patiently waiting for someone at my favorite dev site to cook up a lite de-TouchWiz'd ROM. Apps to SD would be a major win here as well. Right now the LCD density reminds me a bit of the HTC Flyer, which was a dog. Root would allow me to change this as well. For now, the Galaxy Tab 2 is king of the economy tablets. Buy it! In the picture: - Galaxy Tab 2 resting on a paper clip stand. It works great on any device. Do a Google search on "Dean and Ying's Blog - iPhone Paper Clip Stand" for instructions. - I am running ADW Launcher EX and have installed the ICS theme as well as the Honeycomb theme. I am currently running the Honeycomb theme and using an ICS wallpaper. The clock and weather are HD Widgets. ADW Launcher EX along with the ICS and Honeycomb themes, and HD Widgets can all be found in the Google Play Market. If you have any questions let me know!
Froze when not wifi connected and tried to open internet, but reset it connected it and have had no problems since then. Takes a while to learn controls, but caught on after the first day. Fast, expandable. Camera image isn't great, but I did not buy it to be a camera. Also the perfect size and price for a tablet.
Most everything works BUT, can't make it through a 1/2 hr of angry birds without freezing,rebooting, or hanging up somehow. specs as my wifes acer a100, it works fine, this does not
It's only been 24 hours since I've owned it and as such, I can't speak for much. What I can say is that this has certainly served it's purpose for me. That is, to act as a 'training device' for me to get my feet wet with Android. I'm a sworn and avid Apple user and of course the iPad is in a whole different category. Since I'm in the software / technology industry, I decided to 'educate' myself with the Android platform but didn't want to spend $600+ on another higher end tablet. This is why I felt that this particular unit serves my purpose. And so far, I've already installed over 30 apps (most are also on my iPad). I am impressed with how functional a unit that costs about 30% of my iPad really is. On the other hand, I also understand why the iPad is a far superior choice for any tablet user.
Build: It's all plastic and the screen is not Gorilla Glass. The screen is is bright and colorful but not nearly up to the standards of Samsungs cell phone screens. This is understandable as it would add $100+ to the price of the device. Good viewing angles and resolution, better than most at this pricepoint. High quality plastics and a tightly fit body components make it feel sturdy like a premium device (even tho this is technically a budget tablet). Performance: Screen is reasonably bright with great visibility except outdoor on a bright sunny days. Wifi speeds are excellent as is GPS reception. Renders pages fast and does a PDF textbooks well for a smaller device even if it takes a second to render a page when browsing thru pages (out of the half dozen apps I've used for pdfs, Adobe Reader feels the snappiest, surprisingly). I was just a little worried about the performance of the 1GHz 2x TI OMAP but the device is very responsive. Quadrant scores have been averaging about 2620. Software: Feels responsive and uses the screen even better than Honeycomb. This is my first ICS device and it feels familiar yet slightly more polished. One HUGE gripe is how, after all this time, there's no easy/intuitive way to add folder/file shortcuts or files to the home screen. I've solved the problem with a 3rd party launcher and file manager but this should have been implemented years ago. Cameras: Cameras are decent at best. But with an 8MP camera on my cell phone I never really thought I'd be taking pics with my tablet anyway. YMMV. PS: Fits into the pockets of a man's jeans pocket pretty well unless you're wearing skinny/girl jeans. PPS: No LED flash on the cameras but that's okay (see above). PPPS: Although they are a little close together, dual speakers are pretty good.
excellent tablet.....best than ipad!!! I love it .....great screen size!!!
Comes with the latest Android OS (Icecream) so it's very up to date. Wish there was another IR remote app other than Peel. If you have a Samsung TV that they have listed, you'll find it to have even more features such as streaming from the tablet to your tv.
About the same size as blackberry playbook which is what i was looking for, decent screen and camera. OS is beautiful (my galaxy s 2 phone doesnt even have ICS yet) and while processor is not top of the line it gets the job done for what i bought it for, browsing skype email and homework in the future.
This is my first tablet and it is great so far. At first I wasn't sure if I wanted this one because there are so many of there so I took a chance and bought it. But first I took back the Samsung MP3 Player to get it cause I had 30 days to exchange it and so far I'm not disappointed. I liked it so much that I wanted to get one for my wife too. Netflex works great I put on I heart radio and its cool. Go out and buy one..The sound is AWESOME!!!
I have a HP touchpad running ICS, an Ipad, and a kindle fire and I keep coming back to this tablet. This is a tablet that does not need to be messed with. As much as I love trying new roms, the stock rom and battery work for me. I would recommend this to a friend in a heartbeat. The best thing is to go to a BB store and test drive it for yourself. I think you will enjoy it. Its a nice toy for my son.
Almost everything works well on the Tab 2 and am very pleased except that it's Gallery app does not sync with Picasa. In accounts sync only shows Google Photos (assumes that is Picasa). It is checked to sync. Picasa shows in my Android phones and works well even on other Android tablets running ICS. The Gallery app only show files on the Tab nothing in the cloud (Picasa). If anyone else can verify it would be appreciated. Since Tab was bought as online photo tool might need to go back.
I think people are getting the wrong idea of what this tablet is meant for. Multiple sites have done the work and have given an overview of what Samsung is going for; a simple, introductory tablet with stock ICS to compete with competitors' eReaders. No, this isn't the iPad killer, nor is it Samsung's latest and greatest. It's a midrange tablet for eReader users who want a little more functionality and freedom from their device at a very, very reasonable price. Now to the actual review... I just purchased this tablet today and after a full charge out of the box (roughly 1-2 hour wait) it was ready to go. Initial setup was simple step by step, linking the tablet to my Google account to take advantage of the app device to device transfer; so all my apps that I previously downloaded on my android phone I can now use on the Galaxy Tab. My phone is currently running the Sense UI with Android 2.3.4 so my first impressions of ICS and TouchWiz was a bit of a difficult one to adjust to: back button is in a different location, notification bar is on the bottom of the screen rather than the top, and many other adjustments. It feels great after a couple hours of use. The dual core 1Ghz cpu feels much more responsive than my phone's single core 1Ghz, but only slightly, but I figured that because ICS may be more cpu demanding. Widgets are still here and are one of the main reasons why I stick with the Android os. The entire unit is very light and easy to carry around (one reason why you shouldnt compare this to the more powerful iPad). The cameras are below average; VGA front, 3mp rear, but again, thats just to add to functionality over say the Kindle Fire which has no camera at all. Play apps are there: market, music, and books. GPS is there so using maps is possible without a wi-fi connection. The screen is good. Using this as a reader produces ample quality to read for a couple hours. How this compares to other eReaders is that you can download books from the Play store, and the B&N app. Sound quality is good and loud. Things Ive watched have been clear and bass is good for a tabletnthis size. One downside I have noticed though, is a lack of cases for this particular tablet. I assume they will be released in the coming months. Also the app store is lacking ICS and tablet specific apps. Overall this is a great tablet when you consider price, flexibilty, and functionality.
What i love the most is the Android skins. It's very similar to my phone so that made it easier to learn. I seached foe me a tablet for a few months now and came across this one and had to be at Best Buy at 10am lol Super Excited. I recommend to anyone
Just bought it yesterday, after returning my Ipad2. It was easy to set up and configure. Screen is clear and touchscreen works well. Lots of apps. Had no problem w/ Skype, Gtalk, etc. and the camera's are clear. Can't wait to keep exploring. I'd like for more apps to be configured to the 7" screen than there are but the hardware is fantastic. Also, add another 12" to the power cord so it can easily reach from the floor to a desktop. When connecting to a PC the PC sees it as a camera not an sdCard. Do get the USB attachment, it's well worth it. Overall quite satisfied ... hated the proprietary nature of Apple. Yet to use the Remote functions ...
Wow, where to begin. Such an amazing tablet, for an even more incredible price. No-holds-barred Android 4.0 OS, With Google Play Store and Android Appstore. Streaming video is extremely clear, UI is intuitive, and it fits in the breastpocket of a suit. Slightly laggy at times, and some apps crash on occasion, but not enough to even be frustrating. If you have been waiting for the next tablet with ICS and a low price tag, don't hesitate.
This tablet was my first endeavor into the android os, previously I've only owned apple products so I didn't know how I'd like this tablet. I'm happy to say that I love it!
I have been waiting for a little powerhouse to come along at the right price. This was the perfect opportunity. Ice cream sandwich is so fast and it has nice little add ons included such as Polaris Office & Smart Remote. You can even choose between a few fonts for the system. The camera is clear and fast, and the ability to add storage via microSD is another bonus. Only had it for a short while, will try to update with additional information as I use it more. *Wish Bestbuy had more options for accessories for this particular item, but that is not the fault of the product.
Overall too slow for my likes. Compared to my rooted Nook Tablet this thing crawls through screen scrolling. Netflix is pretty much useless. You can scroll (more like agonizingly creep) about one video choice at a time, whereas you should be able to drag at least 5-6 choices left to right at a time. Up and down scrolling is almost invisible in Netflix. Other Apps such as Taptu News also are very jerky when scrolling. Tried to upgrade the Flash Player but apparently already have the latest installed. I am not running, GPS, Bluetooth, maps, navigation, etc, so that is not slowing it down. Video playback (Netflix, YouTube, A&E) is pretty nice, very crisp and detailed. I did note some slight pixelating in videos where the Nook Tablet remains very crisp. The speakers are phenomenal for a small tablet, very loud and clear. (yes, tinny, but you can at least use them) Being used to GoLauncher on Android 2.3 on the Nook Tablet, I find myself frustrated trying to navigate around in this menu system. I have to find a blank screen and hold and press, then select, "Applications and Widgets" in order to display the pre-installed apps - very weird. I'll take it back and let a Geek see if there is some sort of screen response setting or such that is out of sorts. If there is no solution, I'll be returning it and wait on another manufacturer to release a 250-300 dollar tablet. I gave up on the whole Asus Memo build, but now am seeing that there may still be something too it. Another option might be to spring for a Tab 7 Plus as they seem to be much more powerful. If my Tab2 performance is typical, I'd expect these things to be flying back onto the shelves and into the re-furb market in droves and probably sell for under $200.00.
I've been waiting to buy a Ereader / 7" tablet for awhile and finally decided to pull the trigger on the new Galaxy Tab 2. As a long time IPhone user, Android was new to me but very intuitive and easy to pick up on. $50 more than the Kindle Fire and you get ability to add memory cards, built in 1R remote for your home entertainment needs and has access to full Google Market, among other benefits. For $50 extra it was a no brainer for me. I cant comment about how great Ice Cream Sandwich is compared to the other Android ops systems but can tell you that that tablet was very responsive, quick, easy to use, etc.
This tablet will be going back, I thought I would try it out and it is as described, it won't blow you away. The screen is nice, but the internet response is slow, plus you have to wait for the annoying click when you try to move within a website, for $250.00 this is a little hogh for and 8gb, you can get a 16gb ipad2 for $379.00 if it's an open box.
I traded in my Galaxy Tab 10.1 for this new smaller version that came with Ice Cream Sandwich. I have no regrets, as it is a beautiful tablet. Fast and packed with many features. The speed is amazing and streaming videos are quite clear. The tv remote app "Peel" actually works with my Vizio TV and was very easy to set up.
Just got this tablet today for my kids to use it. I am very happy with overall performance. Very responsive to touch, screen display is great, easy to set up. For the money is a great product so far. I wish that Samsung will still have an 8.9 display tablet, and more options as far as storage (16,32,64GB)
I was all set to purchase a Nook Tablet. However after doing some more research on tablets. I discovered the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7.0. Being familiar with Samsung, have both a TV and Blue-ray player. I went to the store to check it out. I was not disappointed. The Galaxy tab was easy to use, had a great screen, it felt good in my hands, and it had a price tag in my budget. The real selling point was it had a full Andriod 4.0 OS. Which the Nook did not. The Galaxy tab is a great product.
Very nice tablet for the novice....or for the advanced user...the screen is very clear and vivid....very portable...
This is my first tablet and I use it every day. I have an HTC EVO 4G LTE with Android 4.0 so the transition was very easy. The screen resolution and brightness are excellent, battery life is very good, and the 7 inch size is just tight for me. The microSD card slot makes storage capacity easily expandable. The Tab 2 has an IR transmitter that can easily be set up to control a TV, cable box, and other devices that use remotes. This has been a very handy gadget and I use it frequently. I found a Belkin stand-up leather case intended for a Kindle Fire that fits perfectly.
My only complaint is the Skype app. Even after downloading itunes, Skype wouldn't download. I have accts at both sites and still nothing. I'm not tech savey so take it w/what it is. Love the ebook feature so I can read books etc. no matter where I am. Still learning how to use this. Worries me about Samsung being sued and Apple winning their case.
I bought this tab because I'm a big fan of the Galaxy format and comfortable with it since my last 2 phones have been Galaxys. However, after I opened my new toy and went through the TRUE specs, I realized that its not 8gb at all. Normally something that says 8 you can expect to be a 6 or thereabouts. But this tab is actually only 4.69gb. And after all the factory preloaded stuff, it's down to 4.24gb. Again, the tab is beautiful! Works well and all. But if you need more than 4gb worth of data on it at any given time, look elsewhere. The 8gb in the product name is misleading.... some would say false advertisement.
No learning curves if you already own an Android phone and it's a really reliable little device. More compact and easier to maneuver than the ipad (I have both)
Great tablet but a little too small for me i recommend the 10 in tab because if u like watching movie
I wanted to try and see how the Google OS worked and I have to say I was let down. It just isn't as easy as the apple OS
Great tablet. Very much like other tablets but it is the flavor of the week.
It is a great use for whenever I go to a new place, including out of state.
Fast and easy to use. Better than Kindle and Nook. Love, love. love it
Bought it for my 12 year old daughter who loves to take notes and research things. She plays games and watches some tv with it. She loves to message me while I'm not at home. She absolutely loves this tablet.
This product is a delight to use. Fast enough for surfing the web. Only downfall was the memory size. This was a easy fix with a class 6 micro sd card.
I purchased this the first day it was out. and returned it because the wifi antenna wouldn't link to my home network while in my back yard. The Acer A100 did. I also have trouble keeping my mobile Samsung Droid Charge hooked to my home wifi network while at home. So if you purchase this product, please test out the wifi capabilities before your 30days is up for returns. I won't be purchasing any Samsung Galaxy products until they use a better wifi antenna. If anyone finds a fix for my problem please let me know with a reply to this post.
I love this tablet. It's great for streaming video and surfing the internet. It's compact, yet has a large enough screen to clearly see video, pages, and documents. $250 is a great price for such a powerful tablet. My only two gripes are that the WiFi reception is horrible. My iPhone gets much better reception than this tablet. Plus, the availability of apps from the Google Play store isn't as plentiful since many of the apps I like to use aren't compatible with a tablet.
Took at the enclosed video and was sold. This tablet does so much and more. It is feature rich. End users are the best at giving accurate info on products. The tablet is a powerhouse. More than I expected. So feature rich it took me 2 days of diving into the settings and apps to realize the capabilities. Not my first Android tablet & I have mostly used custom roms. This is the best out of box experience I have had with an Android tablet. No need to root just tweak. Here are some of the features... -Talkback, reads on screen material or talks out every process. -Personalized message or name on lock screen. -Data usage chart -Limit background processes -Do not keep activities (gets rid of all activity when you leave it) -Task Manager -Multi-tasking -Driving Mode notifications email, text, etc will be read out -Set & information ticker on the lock screen (breaking news, stocks, sports, health, technology etc.) -Power saving -Smartdrive device locking, erasing & location tracking if lost or stolen -VPN -Encrypt device or storage card -Wifi Direct -Share files DLNA -Multiple lock screen lock-swipe, face unlock, pattern, pin, password none -Voice or video calls through Skype or Google Talk This is just the short list. Someone put up a video of the device capabilities.
I initially had an ipad but was getting more and more frustrated with the restriction of use, especially for file transfers etc... This tablet is great, transfering files is easy! HOWEVER, be aware that if you have a Mac the plug and play transfer does not work without extra software, which I never got to work... but there are many other ways to transfer it didn't stop me!
Difficult to use. Too many redundant apps, difficult to place app widgets on the screen you want. Home screen preloaded and confusing. Not enough clear instruction available. It is not user friendly. Could be me, however, I had no problems with Ipad or Iphone.
Don't bother spending $100-$150 on a tablet, save yourself the trouble and get yourself a quality tab for just a little more. Expandable memory and a great camera really make this tab stand out. Highly recommended.
Great size, super fast... Android 4.0 is so smooth This is the perfect tablet is you want to save a little money and still be able to have a great tablet experience. The TV remote feature is kinda cool and the app to look up shows that works with it is a nice add on.
I enjoy using the camera and flash while doing inspections, it lets me screen capture and write notes on picture. So far this has been a great small devise for small work spaces and dark places. Most of the apps that are preloaded...for me...are just not useful. Wish they would offer you a choice in app packages or reduce the price and just let you pick the apps you want. All in all I like the speed, and have not had any issues yet.
Nice tablet but get the Student version for the same price. The Student version is White and comes with a keyboard and usb adapter.
I love the tablet, but the longer I keep using it, the more apps keep crashing. It has the newest version of ICS Android, and everything I bring up a text box that uses the keyboard, the app crashes. Do a search on the web, and you will see it is not only common, but Samsung won't acknowledge the issue. The only solution is a factory reset, and completely wiping the device clean. Unacceptable.
The booklet that came with the tablet did not give enough info to know how to use the tablet.
I had a Nook original, upgraded to the Nook Color and then wanted something that would give me a little more freedom of adding apps and truly "exploring" more. I looked at many options and this was where I was happiest. I love the portable size, the ability to add extra storage via microSD card, and the full functionality this tablet has to offer. Speed is pretty good - not as fast as a laptop but that is not expected since there is far less RAM but I am quite happy with this purchase overall. Sound quality is good for little apps and games but if you're using it to watch a Netflix movie or something along those lines, it can be fairly quiet unless you listen with headphones.
Love this tablet. Immediately was able to just open it up and start playing with the different apps. Made a video right away and on the tablet it does look great. Just easy to use and fun. Reading with this is awesome.
Samsung has produced a fine tablet. It does everything I need. Its only problem is that its touch screen is not always responsive. I sometimes have to touch it three or four times in the same spot to get it to register. I'm still very happy with it.
I purchased this to learn to build apps and have something to work with. It had a good price and decent rep.
I was a little skeptical about this product since I was actually headed for apple Ipad before I found this one. Well, as I found out, this isn't quite the "poor man's ipad" that I thought it was. It does it's job well - weather it's streaming netflix, taking pictures, skyping, etc, really well. My only problem with it is that it freezes on me sometimes requiring me to re-boot. I don't know whether it's something that has to do with the antivirus am using on it or due to the fact that I don't have extra memory card for it. Time will tell.
I originally had the 10.1 version of this tablet, but i felt it was too big to carry around and use comfortably. This tablet's size is excellent. The fact that i can use it in landscape mode and not have to super stretch my thumbs to get the those keys in the center of the screen makes it much more usable and comfortable. The dual-core 1ghz processor is pretty snappy. Despite a little lag here and there, it still was quick and responsive with moderate use. The front and back cameras are decent, but nothing special. Front camera is average quality from a cellphone, and the back camera is about the same as the front (but higher res.) I had originally planned on getting the Nexus 7 tablet, but worries of getting a lemon and it being impossible to find anywhere; i ended up just going with Samsung. One thing that i didn't like about this tablet compared to others including the 10.1 version is the screen quality. The colors are a little dull and washed out, Most likely because of the slightly lower resolution. Overall, this tablet is an excelent choice for those looking for a small easy-to-use tablet that give all the features of a full size tablet, but in a more comfortable size.
Purchased this item for my daughter's 21st birthday. She is a writer and has discovered she can continue typing her works and saving files. She rarely ever uses her $1200 HP laptop for writing anymore.
This was purchased for my daughter as a gift. She loves it
everything is great...it's compact, has great games and very fast...My kids handles it more than I do.
this is my first tablet! I have an iphone so i chose this tablet to start learning or getting used to android. i was satisfied with this product! it's affordable and you can do a lot of stuff in it but compared to newer tablets out there this is pretty outdated! it lags every now and then, only has dual core processor and i'm not that impressed with the video quality when watching videos so i returned it and upgraded it with asus transformer pad infinity! if you're in a tight budget this is good enough.
This tablet works just as good as my wife's Ipad. I didn't want a 10" screen or a $400 price tag. Also really easy to set up. Only complaint is that there is no good case for it. The Ipad has a really cool case/cover but Samsung don't offer anything for these. It may be a little slow once in a while but not bad at all. Seems to be well built. It has a very clear screen with sharp colors.
I love the Samsung which I got for my mother. She finds it quite handy, easy to use and versatile as a remote control, alarm, web surfer etc. great value for its cost.
Bought this for my 3 year old genius and it was easy for him to use. Although I find myself using it more than he does.
Purchased this about 2 months ago. Absolutely love it. Slim, Lightweight, Nice display, Tons of features and apps, Fast, Easy to use. This is a 7" which I actually prefer to the 10" tablets. Those are just too big in my opinion - might as well carry a laptop at that point. You can't beat the price for what you get. It's $400 less expensive than the cheapest iPad and can pretty much do all of the same things. Also, much cheaper than most other tabs out there and can definitely do all the same things as those. In comparison to the "discount" tabs, this has so many more features and functions than Kindle Fire or Nook. This is a full tablet with the newest version of Android, whereas those are basically readers with a few extra functions (no droid). Battery life can be an issue if you're on it for 3 hours straight, but the standby battery time holds up well as long as you remember to close all programs and apps. Better yet, I usually just power it off completely to really save battery since the start up time on it is super fast. I had one issue where the device froze up on me, but I just restarted it and it worked fine after that. No other problems with it at all. Bottom line - spend the extra $50 on this instead of Fire or Nook, and don't waste an extra $400 on an iPad. You'll be glad you did.
Bought it and worked fine for one week. Travelled to another location and wi fi would not work and could not get into the internet at all, even when the wi fi icon was showing a strong signal from the local router/modem. Visited the local Samsung support and they could not fix it or tell me what to do. I am returning the tablet and getting my money back. Will look for another brand. It is the second Samsung item I am returning. 2 weeks ago I returned a 17" laptop because the image would freeze and the mouse worked badly. I will not buy Samsung anymore. Period
I went looking for a good priced tablet that I could use for business and home. I had looked at the Ipad, Kindle and several other tablets. My criteria was plenty of storage, good camera, games, reading app. Pretty general, however all of these combined were hard to find until now. The camera was my hold up as I wasn't able to find anything in my proce with a camera. The price on the Samsung was great, slightly more than I had planned to spend but well worth it. This is the first one I found with a good camera. It's lightweight and easy to handle/carry. I purchased a screen protector and a carrying case with a flip stand to view movies. There's loads of storage for pics and files and I use Dropbox to transfer files and pictures to upload for business. Battery life is adequate, not excellent but several hours worth. Would recommend this tablet to anyone in my price range,
I bought this because I was sick of books being available only on select sites. With this I can read books from Barnes & Noble, Amazon, or any of the independents on one machine. No, it's not the most powerful tablet in the world, but I can use it for small spreadsheets and word files as well as reading & playing games. With its brightness control, I can even read in bright daylight as long as I block my own reflection from the screen.
I love this Tablet. It is very user friendly, and because it is an android there are so many free apps, unlike apple.
It is very fast and can multi-task like I do. The screen is bright and colors are wonderful. The camera takes wonderful pictures. I'm a Realtor and I needed something I can take with me that isn't bulky like a laptop. With this, I have added programs such as Docusign and our zipforms to the tablet. It allows clients to sign documents right at the house. Paperless is wonderful! All the games are wonderful, too! I found a great case on Amazon with a rubber keyboard for $18. It fits snug in the case.
I really cannot say anything bad about this device. It's display is vibrant and refreshes quickly - no noticeable drags or delays. In comparison to my iPad, the Samsung is light and compact, as it is designed to be, and the screen display is phenominal (I did not compare to the iPad2, however). The sound quality is also very good, which is surprising coming from a compact tablet, and the Android OS has thus far been flawless, not to mention there is a wealth of apps available (and growing every day). Samsung continues to impress me and this Galaxy model is undoubtedly another testament to their vision of building tomorrow's technology today. If you've heard the hype about this product and weren't sure what to believe, rest assured this device will surpass your expectations as the hype is not only true, but they (Samsung) have clearly listened to what the consumer has wanted and put that and more into this model. No regrets here - I'm glad I bought it.
We have enjoyed the tablet and are using it to skype. The speed and apps are great. I have added more memory and bought a case for it. Good size too.
Recently I bought this tablet for my fiance, I have always been a big fan of Samsung products, I have a Galaxy S III, had a Nexus S and have series 6 and 7 televisions as well as several of their blue-ray players as they have always been high quality. I was really disappointed with this tablet. I already own a Transformer Tablet (TF101), which compared to this tablet is rather outdated so I expected a little bump in performance or at least comparable performance. First off I would expect something from Samsung to at least have a high quality display. Not only is this tablet low resolution, it also does not have a great quality display in general. The color is washed out and not very crisp at all. As for performance new out of the box this tablet was not the smooth experience I am used to with Android tablets. There was a noticeable lag when doing simple things like changing pages of the home screen. To top everything off, the construction of the tablet is made of a very cheap feeling plastic. This one is definitely a let down from Samsung. I still will buy their other products, but this has deterred me from buying another one of their tablets. This one has been returned.
Over all, very good product, especially for the price and what I use it for!
I just bought this a few weeks ago and have not had a lot of time to work with it. I had to figure out how to make things bigger so I could read it. So far I am loving it and hoping it will be great to travel with.
After about a week of active use, I am even more glad I made this purchase. I've put a 32GB minisd card in it first thing to give me room to grow. Yes, the '8GB' internal memory is really only about 4GB out of the box, but that seems to be somewhat normal across the Tablet industry. Included programs (most I don't use) and the OS do need some space, of course. I've put away (actually passed along) my B&N Nook as this makes an excellent reading tablet. I also have access to Kindle and Amazon as well. I use Evernote quite heavily and the camera (which the Nook doesn't have) is nice. I'm even back to Angry Birds! The screen is great! The manual can be downloaded, but I am patient enough to figure most of it out without the manual. Can't be happier with this purchase. Good size, good speed, good price!
Samsung apparently has know of the following issues and has done nothing to alert the consumers. This tablet does not come with 8gb of internal memory but with 4gb right out the box. Samsung to date has acknowledged the situation and complaints but does not offer any reasons or solutions as to why this is happening to date. The expandible memory SD card is only good for personal files and movies, apparently the programs downdloaded from Google Play cannot be copied to the SD card. This is due because of the program developers or either the Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich is not compatible with the programs out there and do not want them forward to the SD card as per Samsung. Consumers be aware of what you are paying for and getting, and you can make your own educated decision.
I gave up my ipad3 for one of these, The ipad was just too heavy for the amount of use it was getting. This Tab is smaller but still very easy to use , I love the size a lot better and I can still see things on the screen. Does not seem slow at all and that is a plus because coming from the ipad I did not want to lose the speed I was getting while using apps. Have not had it long so time will tell how it goes, but for not very happy with the 2 we picked up.
Great entry level media tablet. Use it to net stream media, music, reading ebooks, internet browsing, and playing games. Extremely happy with my purchase. Best featrues for the price.
Great device! Originally was looking for an e-reader then came across this and really pleased with it. Compact enough to take everywhere and the rear facing camera is great for taking videos/pictures. Expandable memory is something you wont get on some devices so I loaded up a 32G card with music and movies because there are still some places where you can not get to a "cloud" and I have constant access to my files no matter where I am. Read some reviews where they compare it to an ipad, but that is comparing apples to oranges. Price of this device is ~$250 to a ~$500 Ipad. For the price this is a great buy.
First of all, this device does NOT come with an owner's manual which makes it really difficult for us newbies and is why I only gave it four stars as opposed to five. Fortunately I found what looks to be an owner's manual on Samsung's website so I'm hoping it will be useful. There isn't a lot to do on it without wi-fi connection unless you've downloaded some apps and movies. Again, hopefully the owner's manual will explain if it can do more than that. I really like the size and the fact that it has Google Play Store accessibility. It's light-weight and easy to hold, for grown-up size hands at least. This device has a very long battery life which is great!! My son watchedt a movie and about half of another movie on a single charge and we still had battery life left in it. Can upgrade to 32GB of memory. This was a deciding factor in purchasing this product. I've looked at a lot of different tablets and was seriously thinking about getting the Google Nexus 7 but ultimately decided on this one instead and I'm glad I did.. Overall, I would recommend this product to my friends, but I would also recommend downloading the owner's manual from Samsung.
I bought the tablet for my daughter as a birthday present, and we are very pleased with the product. She loves playing games on it and watching videos on youtube. My only problem with the tablet is the amount of memory the software takes up. With all of the bloatware pre-installed you only have 4.5gb's of memory to start off with on an 8gb model. We did expand the memory to 32gb with a Micro SD card, but I wish the tablet did not have all of the added software that my daughter will never use.
My husband just gave me this for my birthday on the 24th. I love it! Havent been able to take my hands off of it. It comes with alot of apps that i wanted already on it. Its very easy to use and because of the size I think its perfect for women to hold. The image is great. Sound is great. Takes pictures and videos wonderfully.
My first tablet. Good price. I like it. I can use it as an e-reader, check emails, facebook and do lots of things online without having to drag a laptop around with me.
It took me forever to decide on what I wanted. A friend bought a Samsung 10" tab and let me play with it. I loved it but wanted a smaller version. I have had it for 30 days and I love it.
I use my tab mainly for YouTube, e-mails and browsing great when you don't want to turn on you computer or use your phone.
if you want average small tablet then this is one that will fit you.
This Tablet is Awesome but when I tried to connect to the 5Ghz channel on my router the tablet could not see it. The box says 802.11 b/g/n but it only connects to 2.5Ghz. With that said it's not a big deal, it still works well on 2.5Ghz.
It's my first tablet and it works great for what it does. Plus the best kind of tablet is a free tablet :)
I can't believe anyone will actually read this and care. But, here goes. Bought the Samsung Tablet 2, 7.0, one day before leaving on a five week trip. Salesperson was somewhat helpful, but there were NO WRITTEN INSTRUCTIONS OR GUIDE with the item. Called back to the store later that evening, and the phone rang for at least 15 minutes without anyone answering. Could not figure out how to download anything except an item I paid for at Amazon. Free books from my library just sat there out in space. Took me 3 weeks to get Google to "allow" me to open an account, and that didn't help either. Item rarely worked with the Sprint 3G/4G Overdrive Pro I also purchased and paid mightily for. Usually only able to go online when in a Wi-Fi area. After about 3 weeks, the Sprint 3G/4G OverdriveProB80 does not work at all. It requests a password, which I was never given.
I bought this for my wife, who is not very tech savy. This means I get to play with it a lot to get it to do what she wants. The interface is simple, even to her, she figured it out in less than an hour, downloading apps is a breeze, we were able to install an app called "Line 2" and now the tablet is a phone as long as there is wifi. The size of this tablet is perfect, you can watch movies and play games just like on the 10 inch tablets, the display quality is excellent. BTW, I am in no way putting my wife down, but for her to like something like this says a lot!!
This tablet has been great so far. I purchased one of these to replace my iPad 1st Gen which was getting some age to it. I was in the market for something that was more portable, but could still handle a lot of the tasks that I use tablets for. I've had the Tab for a little over the month and use it daily. I'm an Network Administrator and use this tablet for managing some of my networks and accessing information in the cloud. There are plenty of applications out there to help you get work done. This device is fantastic for taking notes. You can add a bluetooth keyboard too if you're planning on doing a lot of typing on this device. This device is for you if you're on the go a lot and need to take notes, or send emails while on the go.
great speed,great resolution,you can skpe on it.great internet seed,watch movies,access you tube,great product.keep it up samsuns,outbeats kindle/nook hands down
I was on the fence about buying a tablet because I wasn't sure how much I would use it, so I took my time choosing and did a ton of research. Now that I have it, I don't know how I got along without it! (More on that at the end) While smartphones offer a lot of the same apps, the screen size leaves a lot to be desired. The 10" tablet offerings were not within my desired range for portability. The 7" is a perfect compromise: ideal for reading and for curling up to watch a movie in bed. The ability to add an SD card for more storage is a big win. The Google Nexus 7 is worth looking at too if you want to save even more money. We have that as well and it's great, but it won't suit everyone's data storage needs. Since I don't generally need the full computing power of a laptop and I like to free my phone up for doing crazy things--like talking on it--this has been an excellent investment. The built-in wifi will also save your precious phone data usage. E-readers tempted me for years, but I don't like to be told where I should buy my books. I hate iTunes and only used it once when I realized it more or less trapped me in the Apple "content ecosystem". The same goes for any type of media and I'm glad to see a tablet at reasonable price that handles everything I want to do without dictating how I should do it. The good news about books is that you can still get a Kindle app, a Barnes and Noble app, in addition to several other e-reader apps. More choice is always good, especially when it comes to apps in my experience. Also, because this an Android based device, you can choose to buy (or if you're bold) download apps from anywhere you please. How I use this: -Reading e-books -Reading news (love the News360 app!) -Reading favorite blogs/online magazines offline (Google Currents app) -Streaming Netflix and Amazon Prime (must use a browser to stream Amazon) and several *free* sources for movies and shows -Streaming music, talk radio, podcasts (Spotifiy and TuneIn apps to name two) -Note taking (using a built-in, pop-up keyboard--not handwritten) -As a day planner to track appointments, schedule activities etc. -To look up directions on (free) pre-downloaded maps -Check email away from my PC -Using social media (Twitter, Facebook, and other chat/text programs) away from my PC (look for the Tablet Talk app) -Video chat (Skype app is one of many) -To track my basic finances and pay bills -Browsing the Web -To play games of several types (strategy games, action platformers, word games, RPGs, and TONS of others) I knew that I'd use this away from my PC, but the biggest surprise for me has been how much I use it in tandem with my PC. It always sits off to the side and allows me to look things up on the Web while I am doing something else. For example, while I am playing an MMORPG (a type of online game) I can look up game guides without having to minimize the game. Likewise, I use it for streaming music with the help of a good speaker when I want to spare my PC from juggling to many (CPU heavy) tasks at once--especially in hot weather. If you do more research, you'll quickly find what I did: this offers an excellent bang-for-the buck product when you look at the specs. If you think of yourself as a photographer or photographer-wanna-be, the camera is decent, but not awesome. It's been plenty for my needs, but look at that closely if it matters to you. How much do I love this tablet? If I were a richer person, I'd buy a case of them and hand them out on the street to free everyone from the death-grip that Apple has on the market in the minds of most consumers. And finally, two things I haven't seen mentioned here: make sure you download an anti-virus app for any tablet you get. AVG has a free version that works well enough for most anyone's needs. If you are concerned about loosing it or having it stolen, there are apps that allow you to track it with GPS, lock it, send messages to it/take pictures remotely, and wipe the data. (I went with the Cebreus app)
i got this case for my samsung 7" pad. it was the only case bb had at the time. to be short, this case is really flimsy and very overpriced. i doubt if it is real leather. shop around for something else if you can.
My husband loves it...wish it had a more substantial closure...but he loves it. ???
I love this product, it covers the tab perfectly and just right for my business.
This cover seems well made and looks great. It lacks a pocet which is great for holding plane ticket. It also has no place for a stylist which I use all the time. It would be nice to have these features.
Works great with my Smsung tablet. It's the right size and protect my tablet.
WILL PROTECT IF YOU DROP. FITS PERFECTLY AND WILL NOT COME LOOSE.
Tabs to hold Galaxy in place are too small - Wouldn't keep Galaxy in case. Returned it, and ordered similar case from Samsung.
This is a must have for the Samsung Tab 2 7.0. It matches the item perfectly and hold the tablet securely in a molded base. Has a strap built in to keep it securely closed when not in use. Can be folded over to create a horizontal stand for watching movie or whatever you need to watch in the landscape position.
Good cover as well as providing flexibility while using the tablet.
Well I bought my tablet the week it came out and at that time there was no covers available in the store. This was the only cover available on line for the Samsung Galaxy2, 7 inch. But for now it does the job just fine.
bought this for my wife's galaxy tab 2 7.0. perfect fit! made of high quality materials. specifically designed for galaxy tab 2 7.0. and authorized by samsung. I wish it was on sale when I bought it.
can not afford an ipad but for a samsung tab this is great! live the screen bright & colorful. battery is wonderful as well....
Pretty basic - this thing does what it's supposed to and protects your tablet. It looks decent and seems to be pretty good quality. The only thing I hate about it is that it increases the weight and greatly increases the size of the tablet, which takes away from things a bit. But you really do need a case for it, so what are you gonna do.
Over all this case is great. It is easy to put on the Tab and take it off to clean. The only issue I really have with it is that the cover tends to hand on to oils that are left on the screen. So even after you clean the screen closing the case can smudge the screen again. Nothing keeping a little cleaning cloth can't take care of. Also, the case has a nice style. Make the Tab look like a small book.
love it. works great. would recommend to all my friends.
The case is nice and secure and the only thing I would change is the ability to set it both ways instead of only one way.
Apparently my Galaxy tab 7.7 is an odd size because this is the only case I have been able to find that fits it, even though it technically is for a 7.0 Tab. The straps interefere a little and the stand is not as upright as I would like but beggars can't be choosy and the price was reasonable as well.
The case is great. Feels nice and has a strap to secure the cover to the tablet. It is not magnetic, but that wasn't a big deal for me. The tablet fit in the case perfectly and was easy to put in and take out. I did have to look up how to use the stand on it. The folds were not obvious, but when I figured it out, it functioned properly. The only down side is price. I received it as a gift, but when I looked it up I saw the price. I was sad the person spent so much on it when you can get it (or something like it) on amazon for a fraction of the price. This is truly a case of paying for a brand name. All in all, the case functions as advertised and what you see is what you get. That being said, it is a great product.
Didn't care for it at all. The case would not stay standing up with the Pad. Returned it and bought another brand via online.
This is a nice item to protect your tablet. It is great with a built in stand.
A great product to protect from minor drops and scratches to the screen.
Did not have good luck placing. Seemed to not be the easiest. Ended up buying a cheap one to replace it.
I would rather not have it but don't want my screen scratched or damaged on my tablet. I feel $30.00 is too much to charge for this product.
This is overpriced junk! Ended up in the trash! It folded up on itself while trying to install it. This is flimsy and very hard to install. I am very bitter about being taken to the cleaners with no recourse.
was not installed very well, bumpy and lumpy - would not let them do it again
ive looked everywhere for a good screen cover that actually fit the tab 2 10.1 , everywhere i looked all that was available was covers for the first tablet , which doesnt fit at all , , so after going through about 4 covers i finally found this one , fit great , the application process kinda sucks, because you have to let it sit and dry for 24 hrs but well worth the protection , i wish samsung just included one with the tablet i mean everyone buys one anyway why not just include it , oh well i guess they have to make there money lol over all good buy , just becarefully when applying it
ZAGG shields are the Top of the Line, but you will pay for them. Find a friend that has experience installing one -- the $15 charge from GeekSquad is unjustifiable.. I would recommend this to people who buy Full Coverage insurance policies, but not people who buy Limited anything... if you were price-shopping for your Pad/Tablet, you should not have to take an additional $45 hit on the screen protection..
This is a really nice cover but at $30 you'd best have it installed by the Geek Squad. That costs another $15. Once installed it has not scratched in about a month. But at $45 the value is questionable.
Did not line up correctly, ended up throwing it away. Waste of 30 dollars.
I enjoy my Kindle Fire, it has everything I want in one small easy to carry case, I have everything with me whenever I want to take it with me, which is all the time, when waiting at the doctors, or any appointment that I have to wait, it makes the wait, faster and easier, It is one of the best electronic items I have bought.
This cover/holder for the Kindle Fire is alright. However, when I try to stand the Kindle on edge with the grooves in the cover, it does not hold.
Rocketfish(TM) MY WAY Case is a good for Kindle Fire;however, that the band becomes loses up after a few uses.
GOT THIS AT BEST BUY BECAUSE THEY DIDNT HAVE ANY OTHER CASES FOR MY GALAXY TAB. I LIKE TO USE THE FOLDING COVER TO MAKE IT EASIER TO VIEW MOVIES. THIS CASE IS A GUD BUY FOR THE PRICE. I USE MY GALAXY TAB AT WORK AND IT IS LESS NOTICABLE TO MY BOSS IF I HAVE IT IN THIS CASE BECAUSE IT LOOKS LIKE A BOOK COVER. LOL I AM HAPPY THAT I PURCHASED IT. THE ONLY THING THAT I THINK WOULD PROTECT THE TAB ALOT MORE IS A ZIPPER, BECAUSE I LIKE TO PROTECT THE SIDES OF MY TAB ESPECIALLY THE PART WHERE THE CHARGER CABLE IS INSERTED TO KEEP IT DUST FREE. CANT WAIT TO TAKE THIS OUT OF TOWN WITH ME ON MY TRIP THIS SUMMER!!!!!!!
This was for my wifre's Kindle Fire. I would not have chosen this for mine, but she likes it and it was reasonably priced.
I really enjoy this cover. It protects and allows me the opportunity for hands-free reading enjoyment if my hands get tired of holding it.
Protects your Tablet from scratches. East to carry in your purse or briefcase.
This product works if you're mainly utilizing the kindle fire around the house or for light travel. The unit is solid, has a nice nylon backing and the colored book straps make the feel of the case strong. The unit stays clean and keeps dust from accumulating around the edges of the screen. I would recommend this product for anyone who uses their kindle fire in the house, in the office or takes it with them on occasion around town to appointments.
While inexpensive, this cover works great and protects my Kindle Fire. Before I had the cover, I would accidentally hit the power button. Now that never happens.
this cover is compact, easy to open and close, and can be used as a stand.
I received my Kindle Fire and immediately bought this case to go along with it. The different colored bans add some personality to this otherwise bland case and allow for easy identification of Kindles. I have dropped my Kindle in this case several times and have yet to suffer any problems. I would recommend this anyone who thinks they may drop their Kindle, or people who have more than one Kindle in their household.
This is really a nice little case, Lots of padding. I just wish these had the option to stand the Fire up vertically, as well as horizontally...that would make it perfect!
Great in the US perfect size Apps don't work in south america.
I love this cover... it's durable and able to be customized with the three different color straps that were provided. The only thing that's a little weird about it is the viewing angles when you prop it up. I'm sure it's pretty uniform across all cases like this, but I found it a little hard to see at the angles provided. Overall wonderful case and great value for the price I paid.
Fits the Kindle Fire perfectly. Well made nylon outer cover. Soft inner lining to protect my Kindle. Has a small pocket for the stylus. Props up for horozontal viewing. Elastic band is decorative and functional. I use it to hold my kindle to my music stand to read the sheet music I have entered in my Kindle. Lots to like about this cover. Reasonable price for the protection it gives.
I love this product for many reasons. It protects my Kindle Fire and offers convertibility into a stand with multiple viewing positions which is great for hands-free reading. My husband also has this identical product so having the option of 3 different colored straps is great. It makes identifying my own Kindle Fire a breeze!!
I purchased two of these for my family's two Kindle Fires. They fit well and I enjoyed the color selection of the strap to help identify both Kindle Fires. the build in stand also works well. It is desinged and built well. No damage after two months of use and packing it in my backpack while traveling (flying).
Love it! It allows me to rest my Kindle Fire on my knee for hands-free reading and I love that it opens like a book and is easy to hold. It protects my Kindle from accidental falls (only happened once) and its non-slip surface allows me to set it on the arm of the couch without worrying. I definitely recommend this product and in fact bought one for my daugher-in-law for Christmas after she bought me mine for my December birthday.
This is a great protector for your Kindle Fire. I bought two of these actually. One for my Kindle and the other one to carry hot dogs. No joke. It has the perfect thickness to just barely grip the dog so it does not fall out. It holds roughly 8 hot dogs or 1 Kindle Fire. How cool is that!
I looked at alot of cases, most priced at around $40 instead of $25 like this one. This one has been working very well for our needs, and it props up the Kindle Fire with 3 different angles well. Would recommend to friends and family or anyone with a Kindle Fire, Cheers
Fits my Kindle Fire well. I like the protection it gives.
After looking at all the cases and prices for the Kindle Fire on Amazon, eBay, and Best Buy I decided to go with this one. For the price it is a great case. All functions of the Fire are accessible without having to remove from the case. You can leave the Fire in the case and turn on its side to prop up which is a nice touch for watching videos on Netflix or YouTube. The sides of the Fire are exposed, but unless you are very clumsy or throw the Fire around I doubt you will even scratch it. The color straps are a nice touch.
This was the only case available at Best Buy when I bought the Kindle Fire over Christmas. It does a good job in protection and is easy to use, giving an option to use it as a stand as well when viewing horizontally. A zipper could add a little more protection.
My kindle fire Rocketfish Case is awesome and perfect for my kindle fire...
I bought one of the more expensive ones and ended up taking it back and getting this one instead. This one doesn't have corners that cover up the keyboard like the other one and it gives you a really good position for typing. Plus the colored customizing tabs are a cool touch.
got the kindle fire for my wife for christmas along with this case. case looks good and protects the kindle well. the case does not enclose the whole kindle,sides are exposed, but then again you can charge the fire without opening or removing the fire from the case. the three straps are a nice touch and they keep the cover closed. i tried buying a cover on amazon, but the cover would not close wilth the fire in the case.
Covers made for the Samsung Galaxy Tab 7 Plus haven't hit the stores yet so I tried this case for the Kindle Fire. It's a good fit and it keeps the profile slim (a major selling point of the Galaxy Tab series) though there is no cut out for the back camera. Tab owners will want to stretch out the strap that touches the power button so continuous pressure is not applied. This is a light cover that looks fairly decent. It's not a hard cover so if you're rough with your stuff, you may want to look elsewhere. The pictures above don't show that you can fold the cover so that the screen is propped up at an almost 90 degree angle in landscape mode. The price is right on this item at $25 but I would've looked into a $40 black hard cover version for my Tab if they were available.
Great product. Easy to install and keeps my e-reader protected.
If you plan to use your tablet primarily to watch movies, the easel setup is very nice. If you prefer to hold the tablet in your hand when you're using it, this case is awkward. There are better solutions out there.
The only problem I see with this cover is on my Samsung Tablet 7.0 the top left securing strap goes directly over the on/off switch and holding it down so essentially you can use only 3 of the 4 straps.
I bought a LENEVO 7" tablet and needed to get something to protect it while at work but didn't want to spend a large sum....you had this cover designed for a Kindal that fit and it was perfectly priced.
It is good that there are 3 bands as they stretch out fast. Like stand feature. Sets up nicely on a desk.
Works out great. Purchased with my rewards certificate which helped to offset the costs.
I wouldn't suggest this case for a child. It is not real durable and the elastic corners do not hold the Kindle in place very well. It is nice that you can use the product as a stand as well as a carrying case.
Does the job and fits perfectly for my nexus 7. Comes with 3 color bands and is moderately priced.
Would buy again for the price and protection that this cover provides the Kindle Fire. Wife loves the color to make it stand out from all other black/gray covers for most devices. Only issue that some may have is that the black velcro, stretchy band that keeps the cover closed comes completely off in order to use the device. Possibility for some less careful folks or those with kids to lose it. Other than that, great buy!!!
I purchased this product, but it did not fit my e-Reader very well. Although the website said you carried covers for my particular e-Reader, the store did not stock this particular cover, and I was informed you do not actually carry the particular cover I needed.
I picked one of these up at the local Best Buy store last night after looking at different options online. I am waiting on a much more expensive Portenzo case for my Kindle Fire but thus far I have been disillusioned with their customer service and have a hunch the finished product will not meet and/or exceed my expectations. This case, then, is intended to be an insurance policy in case the Portenzo is a dud. For the money, this is an excellent product. This case, along with the Belkin Folio stand case, were really the only two options I was considering, but the Belkin is $15 more and in my opinion doesn't provide enough in the way of additional panache or features to justify the higher price tag. The Belkin is made of leather on the outside, while the Rocketfish is not, but that doesn't matter to me. Both have nice, soft interiors...the Rocketfish looks more plush with a suede-like microfiber cloth material on both sides of the pad on which the Kindle Fire mounts, as well as on the inside of the front flap. The stand on the case works as it should, is stable and provides three different positions for viewing the Kindle Fire. It looks good when closed and the elastic strap is secure. The system that mounts the Kindle Fire to the case is snug and I feel very confident the device won't slip out accidentally. I was initially concerned with the red color shown on the website, but thankfully it's not nearly as vivid in person. All in all, it's a nice case for the Fire and it may even be good enough to take on a more expensive competitor and come out smelling like a rose...kind of like the Fire itself.
No problems. Is made with quality. Looks like it should stand up well to use.
I have really enjoyed using this case with my Kindle Fire. It provides great protection from many other items in my large duffle purse. I have enjoyed using the Kindle Fire in this case both upright and sideways using the built-in stand on the flap. The only drawback is the velcro strap gets in the way sometimes when the case is being used as a stand. I have to take off the strap completely, and I am afraid I will lose it.
I am happy with it for the most part. It is easy to take out when I want to hook it to the keyboard.
Good quality. Sturdy. However, I expected something thinner. This cover almost triples the thickness of your tablet. That's not good for me. But if that doesn't matter for you then you'll love it.
I have carpal tunnel in both my right and left hand. It's great to be able to read from my tablet with the tablet standing up in my lap on it's own and not hold it. I also love to cook and bake and rely on finding new recipes on-line. It's nice to be able to stand the recipe up and read it while I am cooking! We travel a lot and it's so great to be able to bring my tablet along and not worry that it will get scratched or damaged while in route. It's well protected. This is a great little device, one I am happy to have and use.
We bought the Galaxy 2 and wanted something to protect it other besides a screen cover. This did the trick and it is still very mobile and not bulky.
I love this cover, I didn't even realize that you could also use it to prop the tablet up so that was just an extra bonus! It is very classy looking and does a great job keeping it protected even when I put my tablet in my purse!
Perfectly fits the device and does not prohibit any of the device's functionality
i love it works great looks good. glad i bought it but alittle pricey
I've bought a previous version of this tablet case and find it a little better designed as this one holds the tablet in by molded rubber corners. Overall I'm pleased with the quality and would highly recommend it.
good product, but pricey. i found installation to be troublesome, but the end result was good.
Once you fail to attach the flexible sheet on the screen, never try to detach it again. If you do it again, you must buy another one.
The product is a bit on the expensive side and I had to pay extra to have Best Buy put it on. It looks nice and has lasted 2 months for me. I am not sure I would reccommend this to others, but you do need some protection for the screen.
I paid for installation of this shield , but it was done incorrectly, it stated showing bubbles
Does the job it's suppose to do. I like the fact that is has the warranty!!
Great protection, is slightly off but just barely.
Would not go to the extra expense to purchase and have installed by the store staff. It has a couple of air bubbles that would not clean up.
With the ruff use this should protect the screen from damage.
What is there to say..It was easy to install, and does the job. It looks a lot better quality wise than other ones I have seen and ordered. They need to lower the price though because it is way too expensive for just a touchscreen protector stick-on screen.
We have this Zagg on all of our devices and I think it is excellent. It is just slightly more resistance to light touch than the glass but it sure is good at protecting the glass and very easy to keep clean. We had Best Buy install one on our larger tablet last summer and needed it redone as there were a few lines. When we took it back they replaced it for free and were told that this is part of the package when you have them install it. I put one on my small smart phone and it went well as well but I had one bubble and that always bothered me so for this tablet I spent the extra $15.00 to have them do it and then that way they are responsible for making it perfect. You can see the film when the device is turned off but it is virtually invisible when the power is on. Awesome product! If you are meticulous you can install it yourself. It comes with what is needed to do this and there are instructions.
Its To Hard To Put on. It isnt very clear. Its Weird To touch. Not Recommended
No complaints about this product. It fits perfectly and looks great. The quality is excellent.
Good value. But design is weak in that there is no opening to insert the carge connector with opening the case. Design issue.
This is a nice protective case for the 10 inch Tab 2. The construction quality is high, and the materials are of good quality and seems like this thing will take a beating and last as long as I need it to. The multiple viewing angle feature is nice, makes it great for watching Netflix when going to bed (or at the office, haha). Here's the problem. They designed it with no charge port access hole!! When you have your tab "upright" in the case/stand, the charge port gets covered up when you close the case, and if you have your charger connected while the tab is in "stand mode", it interferes with the anchor points on the stand. Of course, the Tab 2 is 260 degree rotatable, so I could just turn it 180 degrees and have the charge port on the top, but something about having the Samsung logo upside-down while it is in the stand playing a movie or working on a doc is just annoying to me. They should have thought of this and accounted for a charge port access hole. Other than that--great case.
Works great and can use it almost anywhere from your bed to a table without it falling over. If you could close the tablet case while charging it I would give it 5 stars
This is a great case...the leather looks great while also protecting my Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 Works on both the Tab 10.1 and Tab 2 10.1
This cover protects and is priced well. Its made of leather, so it is holding up very well. It holds the Tablet up in various positions w/o slipping down - and its just a nice cover!
got this case for roughtly $50 and after struggling a little to make it fit it looker so very nice, however i noticed that the s-pen corner was covered, at first i figured it was because i put it on wrong but all four corners were fully filled in. making it a pain to remove and put case back on whenever i wanted to use s-pen. got a cheaper one and actually meant for the samsung note 10.1 online. had to return this one, such a shame it didnt have that empty slot corner to remove s-pen
I paid $49.95 for this accessory and I am very dissapointed that it does not hold the Note in place. The corner clips are slightly too narrow and it constantly pops out and slides. I went online and found one for $20 less that is designed specifically for the Note and it works great.
The Case fits the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 10.1 perfect, no interference with the camera's. The Leather has a great feel to it and helps me keep a good grip on it.
Overall, this is a good case. The leather is nice, the look professional. The design allows it to be used as a stand or to lay flat, which is very convenient. If I could plug in the charging cable with the case closed, it would be 5 stars!
I was hesitant to purchase this cover for my Note 10.1 based on other reviewers comments that it doesn't fit. You need to make sure it has the Samsung Note 10.1 sticker on the box. It fits beautifully. It is an expensive cover, but it's protecting a more expensive electronic! It adjusts to many positions and is attractive. I was disappointed that the case can't be closed when charging. I am however extremely pleased with my purchase.
When I had a Tab 2 it was great, but I had to get a refund when I bought the Note 10.1. However for the Tab 2 it was a great product.
Great tablet my wife has the iPad n I think it's just as good. Bought refurbished n looks n works like brand new
I purchased a refurbished tablet online. It worked perfectly fine the first few days. But later i found that the tablet was not reading a micro SD card. When i connected the tablet to the PC, i was not able to move my media contents into the tablet. i got a second one which was refurbished and had the same problem. I returned both and bout a new tablet. This has been working fine so far.
I bought this for my niece as an aid as she began her college career. This was never intended to replace her laptop, but to lighten her load around campus. A tablet with cover weighs a lot less than most laptops. The biggest selling factors for me were that the keyboard dock was included. She says it makes taking notes, which she later brings to her laptop, so much easier than trying to type with just her thumbs. I bought the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 10.1 for my sister earlier this year and she loved it, as does my niece with this Samsung offering. I am not a fan of Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich, but Samsung assured me that the FREE upgrade to Jelly Bean will be forthcoming in September 2012, and since the other tablet being considered was the Google Nexus which already runs on Jelly Bean, this was a relative no brainer.
I love this product and use it everyday to read the news and FBing.
This tablet is great for anyone who wants a small tablet. I did not want a 10' because i felt they were to big and expensive. But this tablet not only comes with a keyboard, but it also has the ability for expandable storage! Now I have a 40gb tablet and the keyboard is very useful at school when taking notes. Although it may not be as fast as the Nexus 7, the expandable memory and keyboard make it a much better buy in my opinion.
I bought this tablet with intent to downsize from my laptop to a tablet. I no longer need word processing, so I thought a tablet would fit my needs. It somewhat did, but overall, I was not happy with this particular tablet. The screen is so small, that unless you have the fingers of a toddler, you will most definitely "click" on the wrong thing multiple times. The keyboard is sticky, so you end up deleting and retyping more often than not. The "hard drive" storage situation is confusing. I would often upload something, then try to attach to an email later and be unable to find it. Lastly, while typing, the cursor will randomly tab to another field or close whatever I was working on altogether. I spent more time pulling my hair out than enjoying this device. After 2 weeks of being frustrated, I returned this tablet and exchanged for a laptop. After all of the accessories you have to buy for the tablet, I ended up spending the same on the laptop. Make sure you know why you're buying a tablet before you get one!
I returned an Asus Infinity for this! The on screen keyboard feels much better. This is lighter and feels better in my hands. The speakers are loud and sound good. I don't really like that there is only one way to dock the tablet but I ordered a cover/stand off ebay for it so it's not a big deal. So far I'm really enjoying this tablet. I throw it in my purse and keep it moving. Getting all the accessories was great and it's the same price as the black one w/o the extras. Love it!
I bought this for my wife, knowing she does lots of online media watching, likes portability and doesn't need another laptop. One of her pet peeves about many of our gadgets is that the sound is never high enough for her. After watching a few Netflix movies she said, "It's the best sounding machine we've got." She wasn't critiquing this as an audiophile but as someone with a hearing deficiency who wants to comfortably hear her favorite shows without straining and with a minimum of distortion. The keyboard has a nice quality feel to it. I don't fear it breaking easily. Battery life on the tablet itself is solid. The tablet loads apps quickly and the screen is sensitive. The infrared emitter was another welcome surprise.The Peel app turns the tablet into a system remote control. We use it with our flatscreen and DirecTV service. The app calls up show logos by genre and one can easily grasp what's on in a glance. Nice addition.
I purchased the first galaxy 2 7.0 when it came out and returned it because the wifi antenna wouldn't link to my home network while in my back yard. The Acer A100 did. I also have trouble keeping my mobile Samsung Droid Charge hooked to my home wifi network while at home. So if you purchase this product, please test out the wifi capabilities before your 30days is up for returns. I won't be purchasing any Samsung Galaxy products until they use a better wifi antenna. If anyone finds a fix for my problem please let me know with a reply to this post.
get this bundle early @ my local store, been playing with it the hole day, battery, screen resolution and touch are superb.the only cons is the speakers but i can live with it. k-board is nice, the big + here is the memory converter and works with almost all my cellphone games. you can`t beat the price!
Ordered online this morning, Picked up in store when they opened without any issues. Got home, did some updates. Used "Peel" and have sunk up 2 of my Cables boxes and TVs. So far no issues after a few hours of use. Will update lated if needed, but I would suggest getting this bundle before its gone.
I'm using it right Now It's fun and worth the 250 ,but the case 40 bucks but overall a special deal because of the keyboard and usb adapter
We have an Ipad 2 and an Ipod Touch, which I love. I've always been an avid user of Apple products because of their quality. However, I wanted a tablet for my personal use and one that I could also set up with things for my 8 year old son to use. The compact size of the Galaxy 2.0 7" is perfect. I researched several tablets and their functionability, keeping in mind price and all the aspects that I wanted it to cover. With the smorgasboard Ice Cream Sandwich operating system, this tablet is perfect. I am able to customize and organize each screen differently. I have one set for my son with educational apps, one for fun and games, one for reading and another for my personal organizer, etc. It's easy to disable preloaded apps and also to unistall apps that you have added. The speed of downloading and searching is excellent. The battery life is good for average reading and use, however with any game play it gets eaten up quickly. The bundle with the keyboard dock is well worth it. It makes setting your tablet up and internet searching so easy! So far the picture taking quality is good and sound is far better than expected.
I bought this cover because of its looks. Now I see it does more than what it looks like, it keeps my ipad protected from falling damage. It also gives you a good grip while holding on to it. I hope people enjoy it like I do. Just take your time installing it.
I will not ruin the story by telling it, but if you are looking for a alfred hitchock like movie this is the one. There is alot of conversation, but it is with meaning. You will always be surprised at what is happening and I really don't think this movie got its just rewards. Don't let this one pass you buy...
We gave this to my son's friend. He loved it! It is very flexible. It comes with the machine and two cones to build the cotton candy on. The parts easily come off to wash. It does not come with any products to make the candy with, however, you can make the cotton candy out of sugar or any hard candy. We had crystals that we used to decorate cupcakes with, we used that also. The kids had a blast making it. You can also buy lifesavers and use those. It's amazing how much it makes. Great buy!
Surprised this machine does not have any samples or even suggested where to buy them (flavored sugar). We ended up using hard candy (same ones they had on their picture in the manual). Worked great the first try but then it got messy. The machine blew strands all over the place and you also have to place a lot of candy to make a decent size. Returned it.
it doesnt cook the items fast enough otherwise it works fine
great machine, but DO NOT use hard candy. it works great but the hard candy looks and feels like plastic. so i bought some floss sugar and make cotton candy all the time now. so spend a few dollars and get the good stuff if you want real cotton candy. also make sure it is total cool before you take the metal center off because you will worp it and it will wobble bad.
Lots of fun but only can make a small amount at a time
Great idea! It takes a little practice to get the technique right but then it's very simple to use. Makes cotton candy from any hard candy, we even used cough drops to see if it would work.
Our Granddughter absolutely LOVED her Christmas gift -- and her baking experience was incredible! Recommend this to everyone!
Get one of these and you'll be the hit of the party. Make sure you get the one that specifies hard candy because then you can use any two pieces of hard candy to make your cotton candy. That gives you virtually unlimited flavors! It cleans up easily. You just have to let it cool down first.
This unit is great for making small amounts of homemade cotton candy. It was easy to put together and easy to clean. Although it was a little hard to keep the candy on the plastic stick that is included, my 7 year old grandson could make it himself with close supervision. There is a heating element that does get hot. I don't know how durable it will be; it was the first use.
This machine is giving my daughter a bundle of joy, she's having a blast with it..money well spent
It's a great, really cool concept and useful for it's purpose. Only downside is it can be extremely messy, it chucks the candy everywhere! Easy to clean up and easy to assemble.
Easy to use. Easy to clean. Great to use when grandchildren come to visit. Was really impressed.
Bought this for my 11 year old who likes to play in the kitchen. Of all the things I've bought for her, this is one of the few that actually works and doesn't require refill kits, so that's a plus for me. It's also easy enough for her to set up and use with little to no assistance. We're happy with the purchase.
This cotton candy maker was a gift from "SANTA" for my 8 years old daughter. She put this machine in the wishlist and SANTA gave it to her!! She is now having fun making cotton candy everyday. It works great, easy to use, easy to clean up and fun to have it in the house.. She will have her 9th Birthday party soon, so this will be a blast for all the kids (and adults too...) !!!!
Love it! Easy to use, Easy to clean, Easy to eat! Kids absolutely love making cotton candy and with 1 Tablespoon of sugar you can make a whole stick of cotton candy. Cleans very easily with hot water, soap and a towel. All around fun item to have around the house!
I bought this for my dad for Christmas and he will not stop making cotton candy! It's easy to make and extremely easy clean up after! *READ THE INSTRUCTIONS ENTIRELY! If you don't, it will only create a very small ball of cotton candy. If you do, you will have cotton candy the size of a softball! We bought floss sugar and used it and it tastes just like how the Carnival makes it! Hard candy does work just as well, but if you want the classic cotton candy taste, you should definitely buy flavored sugar to use.
I had bought a different cotton candy maker last Christmas, but sugar flew everywhere and it produces an extremely small amount of cotton candy and it broke after a couple of uses. I got this one this year and it works GREAT. NO flying sugar and it makes a good amount of cotton candy- especially if you use flossing sugar. Hard candy works great too but it doesn't make quite as much! I recommend this product 100%. GREAT BUY! *Make sure you let it heat up for about *5 MINUTES.*
I normally wouldn't think to buy my child a cotton candy machine for Christmas, but I was short on ideas. Turns out, this was the best gift ever! It works extremely well and is really easy to clean up. I read other reviews saying the cones do not catch the sugar very well, I think they work excellent. No problems here! We love it!
This thing has gone to many parties with me! The kids LOVE this thing, and the cotton candy that comes out has even more taste than the candy when it gos in! There are some flyaways though that can make a mess, but its not bad. I just stick the parts that I can in the dishwasher and it all comes out clean. I do wish you could take all the top part off (cover to the heating element) it gets a bit sticky after some use but can be cleaned with a hot washcloth. I have given 3 to friends kids for birthday gifts, but I did ask first. Its easy to use and easy to clean!
Despite what other reviews are saying candy does not fly all over the room it you read the directions and do what it says, yes the candy does not stick very well to the "cones " provided, however that's a plus to reusing them, if you want something to stick go to the local rental center and pick up the paper cones they stick but you can only use them one time, so like the other review says if your looking to serve large party's this is not for you. rent the real thing, you want to save money for the family and friends, and the ability to choose the flavors you want this is perfect for you
The cotton candy machine had clear instructions, was easy to assemble and clean, and does what it is supposed to do. When we purchased it, we thought that we might be able to use this for a school carnival, but it takes a long time to produce a small amount of cotton candy. In our case, this is perfect for home use, since a piece or two of hard candy makes a good snack-sized treat for our daughter, but if you're planning on using this for a party, you might want to reconsider.
Amazing machine! Follow directions and it's great!
This is a fun toy. Yes, a toy. You can make cotton candy with it but it's not very much at one time. You put hard candies/candy in the center piece and it spins around and melts until it spins the cotton candy. My kids love to sit there with a flashlight in one hand and the cotton candy wand and watch for the strings to appear. My kids are 8 and 11 and do a decent job spinning the wand (or whatever you wanna call it) so the candy gets on to the stick, but they struggled early on to not bonk it into the side making the candy hard and not cotton-y at all. But they play with it a lot and really enjoy wowing their friends when they come over. It was a great event for about 5 kids to all participate in and watch and eat and play. They always have fun trying new flavors and playing with this toy.
I am in my 50s, my granddaughter is 5. We have so much fun making an endless variety of flavors. My favorite is strawbearry creamsavers with worther's original on the outside. She likes cherry lifesavers with grape on the outside. This cotton candy maker is easy to clean and dishwasher safe. I took it to work and my co-workers enjoyed making and eating cotton candy. We felt like kids again! Time is one of the most precious things to share, and this cotton candy maker lets you spend quality time with others sharing, laughing, talking and my favorite - eating.
Starts working fast and fun to play with. Everybody has fun with it.
I love this machine and had a very enjoyable snow day with my three kids and two of their friends! I think when purchasing this machine you should have realistic expectations. If you want circus or carnival size cotton candy, then this is not the machine for you! It does however spin just the right amount for a fun time for you to spend with your kids! We used yummy earth organic lollipops and the flavors were amazing!!!! We crushed them up in a ziploc bag and scooped them into the hot zone! We made 6 batches of cotton candy without any clogging issues and the machine was very easy to clean after its use. We have already made plans to do it again...hopefully after SCHOOL tomorrow!
I received this Cotton Candy Machine as an xmas gift and I am very satisfied. It's very simple to use. Place a couple pieces of your favorite hard candy and tasty cotton candy is born! The instructions recommend adding only 2 pieces of candy at a time which limits the amount of cotton candy you can make; but other than that, I have no complaints. The clean up is a cinch since you can easily take it apart. My husband and I have experimented with all sorts of hard candy and flavors. Lifesavers (fruit-flavored) seem to work the best. Cinnamon flavored hard candy works well too and tastes great. Now I'm on the search for cotton candy flavored hard candy.
This is a flop. It produces a tiny amount of cotton candy that wont stick to the provided holder. My kids got some laughs because the candy was continuously projected from the machine. They were disappointed that they did not end up with any cotton candy, instead they ate the hard candy they were using for the machine and called it good.
10 yr. old grandaughter's birthday gift. She was very dissapointed that the product did not work well. The problems were, difficulty in the candy adhering to the tube, a lot of airborn particles of candy, and the hard candy not melting completely (had to be scraped away before putting in new candy).
The grandkids got turned on by the cotton candy at the county fair, but I had to feel guilty about letting them eat spun sugar, regardless of how delicious we found it to be. The beauty of this machine--beyond its simplicity of use right out of the box and the ease of cleanup--was its ability to spin cotton candy out of sugar free candy. At least that part of the guilt is gone--and the little ones love the different flavors and colors they get from the wide range of hard candies on the market. Didn't know what to expect, but this was a no-brainer for old grand-dad.
The kids love this, however when you are making the cotton candy, it only makes a small amount of cotton candy. So you have to end up making alot more.
Product wasn't what I thought it would be like. Couldn't make cotton candy cover the cone before it hardened.
Overall, this is tons of fun. My kids and I have a great time using it and it's easy to clean up. I love that I can use hard candies instead of having to buy the special packets of sugar like other brands require. I had seen others talk about using peppermint life savers and thought "No way". Surprisingly though, peppermint makes an excellent cotton candy. The only down side is trying to get the sugar filaments on the sticks. Sometimes it gets caught up on the center and then melts. I haven't been able to figure out if it's the sticks/cones, me, the type of candy we use, or all of the above. But it doesn't happen every time. It's definitely worth it, IMO.
Before you buy this product know that the picture is incorrect. This is the glossy version which is harder and more expensive than its sister product the rubber version (usually cheaper in price and better made). The rubber version is much better. Best Buy needs to change the picture of what this product it b/c its misleading. This is what it should be instead of the rubber: http://www.google.com/products/catalog?q=hard+candy+cases&oe=utf-8&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&client=firefox-a&um=1&ie=UTF-8&tbm=shop&cid=13544644973522057874&sa=X&ei=o1ByTsbbFcbV0QGc4byVCg&ved=0CFMQ8gIwCw
I have had this case now for only a few days. I had to have some protection for my Ipad2, because I cringe whenever my 5 year old walks across the floor and points at the screen showing me something and only holding it with one hand.....you know the feeling. So as far as the actual street skin goes, its okay. It's like something from out of the Matrix or like something that would come from Catwomans suit. It's not exactly the kind of rubber I thought it was going to be. I was hoping it would feel more like a tire, but it feels funny. Its almost tacky, with a slight glossy look to it. . It adds very noticeable weight to the Ipad2. The skin feels like it would protect it from scratches, but not necessarily a drop from a couple of feet. The screen protector flips back, but you have to adjust the hinges seperately if you dont want them to tare. This is really the only challenge I see with this case. I know in time that with myself and my kids being absent minded sometimes, one of us will try and open it and eventually tare the hinge. Overall its decent protection if you just want something that goes over the Ipad2 and will keep it from getting scratched. There are better reviews and more positive reviews on the product at Amazon.com. Im not one to try and talk someone away from buying something. I will add that it does look better in the picture and isnt what I expected it to be.
From the pictures and description, the case looks and seems 10x better than it actually is in person. The case is hard as a rock, super glossy, scuffs easily, very difficult to fit the iPad into (it almost tore my screen protector off, and I can't imagine how my iPad is going to come out of the case), and it wears prematurely. I've had the case for two weeks and have treated it well, but it is beginning to wear near the hinges; soon, I imagine, the screen cover will probably just break off at the hinges. Overall, save your money...this case is too expensive for a cheaply made product.
Great CD! Fantastic lyrics and solid,tight band.One of their best CD's. Replay value is high. Get this CD! You won't be sorry. Your CD collection will be upgraded as soon as you own it!
It does not seem to stay snapped together. Should have researched this case a little further. Disappointed
It's been a little over a month since I started using this case on my IPad, and it's already getting dirty and some parts are falling apart. So, quality is not so great. It only gives you one folding position, which sometomes is not enough. However, the color is outstanding and it's a great eye-catcher. Great for short-term use, not a great long-term investment.
I purchased the IPad 2 as a gift for my wife. She is very active with her IPad2 but was afraid she would drop and damage it severely. Once she put the IPad in her case, her fears are almost gone. She's not worried about scratches or drops. A great security blanket for her and her new playmate.
I bought this case on June 1st and returned it a month later because it was starting to peel offl on the inside. Nothing rubs against it, it just started to separate. The case looks really nice and has a soft feel. However, I would not recommend it if you're also looking to protect it. It does cover the corners which is one of my main concerns protecting a $600 investment.
I bought it for my boyfriend for Christmas. He doesn't have an actual Ipad. He has a tablet. The case was a little small but with the stretch of zipper we were able to get it closed. Other wise, he Loves it. He didn't have a case before so he is very pleased. The bubbles make it easy to grip while caring it. :)
Love this...rigid enough, not too squishy. My iPad slipped out of the car onto the ground while inside this case and everything was just fine. Love the style, too!
simple and efficient, protects ipad and provides stand for watching.
Nice case but I wish the case would snap together tighter.
It really protects my mobile and its a cute. Not bulky at all!! It gives off an echo when using the speakerphone on the device which plenty people tell me when I use the speakerphone.
the case did not fit, even though you said it was for the specific phone we had. the holes were not aligned with the needed ones, like for the charger and camera, etc.
It fits my Macbook Air 13 " like a glove. It looks great. I got it because I wanted it to buffer the sharpish edges of my machine, and it does just that. I got it in red and the color makes me very happy. Very much as advertised.
Bought it as gift and it look awesome. Seem to have better quality than other.
I've used some lighter pens in the past, but this has a nice balance to it. This pen has a little weight to it. Built in pen is also cool. Beautiful design, metal, not some cheap plastic. Thanks!
Well i recently bough a charger and a pack of 6 AAA bateries but i guess they fall under the same category since they are the same but different amount pack...They work great except the charger is expensive besides tht they last me 6-9 hours on an mp3 and a LONG TIME on remote controlls
Bought these to use with kid electronics. Much better value than replacing regular batteries all the time.
Not bad for the price.......................................
Saves me a lot of money on triple-a's! Bought it mainly for a digital camera but have used it for many AAA powered items. Thanks BB!
I have being using it seen i bought it and is great!! I am not stuck as before with the batteries......
I purchased this charger on sale, intending to use it along with my wireless gaming controller and my digital camera. The included 1700 mAh batteries have been performing well so far. The only problem is the time needed to charge up the batteries the first time; it took about one hour more than the six hours advertised on the package. Still, it's good not to have to worry about buying batteries all the time.
I bought a set of rechargable batteries for my nintendo wii fit because I noticed that alot of these battery packs they are making available are also voiding your warranty if used so I figured this was the best way to avoid voiding my warrant and avoid buying batteries all the time. I only paid 19.99 for the set not bad considering Im sure Id spend that in a few months to buy run of the mill batteries for it. It takes 6 hours for them to charge and I suggest buying another set to switch between so you always have a set on the charger charging while one set is in use.
with so many electronic gadgets around the home, needing new batteries is a constant thing. these are more economical than buying disposables.
Easy to carry when traveling. Very easy and friendly to use, anybody in the family no matter the age can use it. It is fast and efficient.
Length of charge hold could be longer but otherwise a good charger for the money.
Excellent product! I bought this for a peripheral of my Wii, and i use it with my digital camera, digital videocam, wii remotes, and works great excellent recharge time
The package I received was the correct number CEF14NC, but the batteries are 1800 mah, versus the 2050 mah specified in the description.
I recently bought a Canon Powershot 720IS and opted to go with the Duracell rechargeables, after being very disappointed with the Energizer rechargeables. These batteries have surpassed my expectations. I have had the same set of batteries in my camera for about 5 weeks now and taken about 375 pictures on them...not a ton of pictures, but i don't see any sign of the battery life dying out here soon!
These rechargeable batteries are great. They last a long time in my Cannon Powershot Digital Camera. While I'm using one set, the other set are charging. Both sets lasted through me taking several hundred photos on a recent trip. These batteries are worth the money spent.
Good battery charger. Little slow but it gets the job done for a good price, plus it comes with four AAs. The fact that you can also charge two AAAs is great as well.
I am not sure if the unit does not work well, but when I got to using them, I noticed that if I charged them and immediately put them in my camera (Kodak Z712), I immediately showed that my battery power was low. I could get 20 photos (at best) before they were dead. Many times I got less than that. I might be able to use them for something else, but in my limited experience, they are anything BUT great for digital cameras.
Its the cheepest charger that comes with batteries AND its the allmighty DURACELL brand, what could get better??? May take a while to charge but i only use two at a time so i personally have no complaints!
This charger has gained a nice mark in my books. Sure there are several other chargers out there, but is there one as low as this that INCLUDES batteries, can change between AA/AAA, and has the famous Duracell brand to it? I'm into photography, computer applications, traveling and hiking/camping so the point that this doesn't cost an arm and a leg and has a decent charge time makes it well worth it.
Somewhere around December, I bought this Duracell Charger to use with my Wii Remote. The selling factor for me though was that this charger came with 4 AA rechargeable batteries. How has this purchase held up, though? Just fine. Sure, I haven't been able to charge your batteries as quickly as I would have with a more expensive charger, but seeing as most of the appliances I use (the Wii Remote in particular) only require two AA batteries, alternating the pair I'm using and the pair in the charger has served me just fine.
I bought this to replace an Energizer charger that had "konked out". This Duracell charges batteries very quick, come with 4 AA batteries and charges AAA batteries as well. I've been happy with it so far.
I looked up which batteries and chargers were better - Duracell or Energizer and came to the conclusion that Duracell was for me! Great little charger, lets you know when it's running and when it's done. Love that it does both AA and AAAs!
My Compaq Presario CQ 60 replacement seemed to be the same as the OEM battery, but it wouldn't fit. Goes in but won't lock in and just falls out. Very disappointing. This is my second atempt with after market battery. Best to just replace with OEM.
This Duracell product is a good product. The problem is that the cells that I bought were either very old or had been exposed to a bad environment. One cell was leaking when I opened the package. Needless to say it would not take a charge. Other cells do take charge but their service time is less than expected. I have other Duracell rechargeable cells that perform much better. Duracell should age date their rechargeable cells. Best Buy should keep track of the age of this type of product at their warehouse. I would not recommend buying these from Best Buy.
rechargeable batteries are the way to go in our power hungry world. better batteries are needed but for now they work fine. i use them throughout my house with no complaints and recharge them overnight for non essential products.
Does exactly what batteries should. Power things. And it did it well.
I consider myself a battery connoisseur and let me tell you, these batteries are top notch. If you went to a 5 star restaurant and asked for batteries, you would receive these black and copper cylindrical delights delivered to you on a silver platter.
These are very good batteries. They are long lasting. I use them for everything!
They are worth the extra cost for their long-lasting capabilities!
duracell batteries are the bomb! i swear by them all the time. they're a bit pricey, but worth every penny.
i think the Duracells are great batteries, for I have used these batteries on my TI-86 and they have been great in the amount of time they last me. I definitely recommend these batteries
These batteries blew my mind away. The package was very easy to open and the batteries came right out into my hand. Inserting them into the device in which they were intended for was somewhat difficult but that was due more to "operator error" than the battery design. The batteries themselves perform better than expected and just seemed to keep going and going and going and going. I would highly recommend these batteries to anyone in need, best thing of all.....they also come in different sizes!!!
This product is great because it lasts very long. I would reccomend this product to anyone who is looking for batteries for Hi-tech devices.
What a fair deal, quality products at a price next to none.
I used the product. The charge doesn't stay that much.
OK for wireless bluetooth headsets. MUCH MUCH better than the 300Mha's I was using previously.
I used thes in my Cannon Power Shot and was surpised to discover that they had a shorter life than regular alkaline batteries.
Best price for named brand and high capacity batteries.
This is a must have for hand held gaming systems and all of the gadgets that require batteries.
Quick purchase on the way out the door. Same price as competitors including Walmart.
I needed to spend a certain amount of money for a rewardzone certificate I had. So I baught the batteries. They fit nicely in my remote control.
I have sed Duracell for many years. The batteries last longer than some cheaper brands. I never get the leakage that you do with some brands.
These are well priced and work good with everything that I wanted them too. They also have good battery life.
A good buy for all those products that require many batteries of this size
I was actually sent an email to review batteries. These were the best batteries ever. I opend the package. I placed them into my electronic device. I turned the device on. It worked. I could not be more happy.
The copper tops I have found are the best rechargeable battery for use with my DSLR flash. I have used other brand and there is no comparison!
Just got home with my batteries so I haven't had a chance to use and review them. But I just wanted to share that the Mah rating is not what is shown on BB website. They show a package with a 2650Mah rating and the package I bought (same SKU number DC1500B4) is listed as 2450Mah.
These are really good batteries, easy to use, but it seems that you need to charge them like two times before they start working fully.
First, all buyers should be aware that NiMH batteries require a refresh conditioning period when you first buy them. Reconditioning is the process of fully charging and fully discharging the batteries several times until the full capacity is realized. This process is especially important if the batteries have been sitting on the shelves for a long time unused. There are some battery chargers that have a Refresh function that will automatically charge and discharge them repeatedly until the full capacity is reached. Do not charge these batteries only once and then expect to get the full capacity out of them. If you do, then you might only get 10% of the full capacity on your first use. After breaking in (conditioning) the batteries, they are one of the longest lasting rechargeables on the market. The 2650mAh number tells you the capacity. The higher this number, the longer lasting the battery. I had one batch of batteries that had 1 out of 4 (25%) bad batteries. This caused my runtime to be shortened. I used a Radio Shack battery tester to identify which battery was the lowest voltage (essentially completely dead) after each use and put them aside and only used the ones that had a measurable voltage. Once I eliminated the bad batteries, my runtimes increased significantly. I exchanged the bad batteries for new ones, and now I have a perfect set of batteries. The battery tester is an important piece of equipment to use to identify bad batteries. Good luck with your batteries!
These Duracell Rechargeable are horrible.... I charged them up 2 weeks ago got ready to use them on my Canon 580ex flash and when I needed to use them, they were dead.... Luckily I had some extra alkaline batteries otherwise I would have been out of luck. These batteries are unreliable and don't hold the charge as expected.
I bought this for my digital camera. Good so far. Make sure you get the 2650mAH - that's the current longest lasting version.
I use them in a Canon powershot 12.1 mega pix. camera it uses 2 batteries after you recharge them a few times they pay for them selfs so they become free i say buy them along with a fantastic Duracell 15minute battery charger they work great together i be nuts about them. :) As you can see i be super happy about them. I live a long use with my camera along with the worlds best precharged batteries that Duracell makes and i am glad that i can buy them at bestbuy stores.
Duracell seems to have an edge on the competition. These batteries do work very well, as advertised. I do like the 15 minute charging capability and the overall performance of the charger and battery set. The charger is fan cooled and seems a bit more robust than some.
Duracell keeps going and going, most recommended batteries people should buy
When I came across these batteries, I was a little skeptical about how expensive they were compared to other batteries of similar make and amount. I mean, you can get 20 AA duracell batteries for only $10 and these alone will run you $15 or more for only 4. This said, these batteries work great and keep on working for months. While you may be going through the 20 batteries rather slowly, the rechargeable ones will be working long after the regular AA ones have been exposed of. Since I have also used the other AA rechargeable batteries (the 2650 mAh), I have noticed that these batteries tend to last longer in my devices and do not need to be recharged as often. Overall, these batteries provide a great quality while not giving as much in terms of quantity. They are a great investment and keep on going. *Plus, I have had these 4 batteries for over a year and they are still working fantasticly.
They work great, bot much else to say. You may want to consider purchasing a decent charger to keep these working their best. The small charges you get with them are not the best for long term use.
There Batteries and they work!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
These batteries last forever. They are one of my favorite purchases!
A couple Christmases ago I gave these chargers to my three sisters and their families as stocking stuffers. By the following Labor Day I heard rave reviews about how much money they saved on batteries for their kids' things. I bought one for myself and had to return it in a week due to the smell! I don't know what the cause was, probably the plastic housing. The chemical-sort-of-smell was always there and did not depend on using the charger or how warm it was. And the built-in fan for cooling the charger and batteries also blew the smell all through the house! I gave up on it and wrote a letter to Duracell asking for them to change the plastic housing, if that was the problem. To this day the charger appears to be made of the same material. Disappointing. I will not buy this brand until a visible change is made.
This is the best investment....I couldn't be happier!
My family goes through a lot of batteries so I purchased this unit and a stack of rechargeable batteries to rotate through our cameras, Wii, remote controls and other devices. Soon after purchase I started noticing a flashing red light on the recharger when I placed one or more batteries in the device. When you get the light, the battery will not be charged and the recharger will continue in that condition with the fan running indefinetly. Since then, more and more of the batteries have become unrechargeable. My internet research has yielded some interesting accusations and tesimonies just like mine. Many people recommend buying the 6-hour charger instead.
the 15 minute charger made by duracell works great with duracell's precharged batteries i have a canon camera that uses 2 AA batteries that duracell combo the charger and precharged up batteries is where it is at all the way. :D i have a grin from ear to ear!
I love that the batteries are fully charged in such a short time. I don't have to worry about bringing extra batteries because they last the entire day. The entire charger is very compact and fits easily into a small tote.
i recently bought this from best buy after reading some of these reviews and thought it would be the best choice considering i was buying them for my xbox 360 controllers and was thinking about buying the rechargeable battery pack kit for the controllers itself but that only means you can only use them for the controllers only, i bought this instead for a couple bucks more and i love it, it charges real fast compared to others that take hours including the xbox rechargeable batteries,now i never miss playing through an all nighter anymore, and the battery life on these batteries are incredible, i even use them with my other electronics especially a camera that used to drain all my new batteries but not with these, the batteries are strong enough to keep anything powered, overall im happy with them and think its a great deal and recommend it to all the fellow gamers,
This is the best charger out on the market. It has the fastest charge time - 15 minutes! If you have devices like digital cameras, controllers (Wii, 360, etc.), MP3 players, portable CD players, or other high drain devices, but don't have time to wait for other battery chargers, then this is the charger for you. I use this occasionally and plan on buying more AA and AAA batteries to use with this charger because it is so quick and easy to use. I know it is pricy, so you might have to consider, but you should buy it, YOU WILL GET YOUR MONEY'S WORTH OUT OF IT!!! I have not encountered any problems yet, but there is only one charging indicator for all four batteries and I would not like to have to check each battery if something happened to go wrong. In the earlier review the reviewer no doubt has a defective charger and/or batteries. Overall, this is the best charger and if you use many batteries, then I recommend you buy this charger.
I got this as an additional charger to my Energizer charger. I was excited about the 15 minute charge time vs. the 30 min that Energizer claims. While the Duracell does charge faster than the Energizer there are a few things that either failed, or are not as good. The Duracell only has one indicator light to say if batteries are charging, done or if there's a problem. If there's a problem with one of the batteries the indicator light flashes, then you have to go through battery by battery and pull each one to see if that's the one that has a problem which is a huge headache. Next, it seems that the ports are just not working as if I charge three batteries with nothing in the third slot, 9 times out of 10 it works fine and charges just those three batteries. If, however, I add in a fourth battery it will say there's a problem. Maybe I got a dud, but I prefer the Energizer charger with four separate indicators telling you exactly which batteries are complete charging and if there's a problem, which battery it has a problem with.
I use this charge and four sets of four AA batteries in rotation for the flashes for my pro camera and the four controllers for my Nintendo Wii and its wireless receiver. I've had the charger for over a year now and use the devil out of it. I have tried many rechargable batteries/chargers throughout the years and these have performed flawlessly for me! I plan on buying another one shortly so I can have one charger in my camera bag at all times.
this product will save you a ton of money. MP3 players eat up batteries fast and this will save you a fortune. The batteries hold their charge well even after several uses. the Charger is excelent and saves you time over other chargers.
This battery doen not function with the Macbook. Laptop will not recognize the battery nor charge it. I cant believe this is actually sold to the public as it does nothing but enpty your wallet
so much better than short charged ones that have to constantly be changed.
Very happy with these batteries. I use them for my wireless mouse. Before them other rechargeable batteries would last one week or less. (I'm a graphic designer using them at least 8 hours a day). These batteries last several weeks worry free.
i bought these batteries a few years ago when i was using them for things that were draining disposable batteries like nothing. i am happy to say these are the only things that have held up and have never let me down. their are major benefits to getting these batteries versus getting the cheaper disposables they last years. also the power that they hold are way more then any regular battery can ever hold. so if you have demanding electronics these are the only best option that you have to go with.
i great for my Wii mote but the price sux i saw some cheaper at BJ's
I couldn't recommend better longer-lasting batteries for the price. I use these very heavily in my xbox controllers and a few other electronics as needed, and they last for up to two weeks for my demands.
I use these in my wireless keyboard and mouse. Holds a charge for a long time! Buy two sets to swap and your good to go.
I purchased a charger (it came with 4 AA batteries) and a pack of 4 AAA batteries. I originally purchased these batteries because I bought a Turtle Beach 5.1 surround sound headset (to play or watch movies late at night without waking others up). I had read reviews on the headset that it consumed batteries like a kid consumes candy. I got home and prepared for the test. I was extremely happy with the results. The headset lasts for a good week and a half (3 hours or less playing non-stop per night) which is ok, considering it produces surround sound wirelessly. Though I initially didn't really plan to use the AA that came packaged, I tried them on my Xbox wireless controllers. To my surprise, they last about 1.5 times longer than the licensed battery pack from xbox. In the controllers, I can easily play for 2 weeks straight without needing a recharge. Now, I bought a separate charger for my wife to use on her mp3 player (single battery AAA) and that can go on for a whole month. I am now going to buy some more batteries for a remote control helicopter toy and they will stay in that remote permanently. Though many people complain about the price, I don't, because I am more than getting the value of the batteries. I think they are priced just right. Think about it, regular batteries cost anywhere from 4-5 dollars with tax. Having these batteries is equivalent to having purchased at least 10-15 packs of batteries per year (depending on how you are consuming their power). TIP: I agree with another reviewer, keep an extra set fully charged so that you can just swap batteries on the fly. The charge time on these is 9 hours for a full charge (but can be removed before the 9 hours if you need them and they would last a fair amount). Though many may frown at this wait time, we have to remember that those 9 hours are saving you money. Charge them while you sleep, and keep the extra set charged. They don't loose their charge if not being used. We can't expect society to be giving us instantaneous results without hindering value.
I use these in my Wii remotes and all the most common high use items. May not last as long as reg. batteries but re-charge and everything is back up and running. Good for the enviroment too. I have't found a device that these didn't work in.
I have had a AAA and AA 4-pack sets for about a year and I am going back to get some more (only for extra devices and to have spares). All the good things are true as with the idea of recharging batteries. less waste, you don't need a stockpile of batteries sitting around the house. these last longer than any set I've tried before and I haven't noticed much power dropping until they are just about to need a recharge. They work great in the devices i have them for (Currently 2 TV remotes, 1 wireless gaming headset and my 4 Wii controllers). I don;t know if i would use them for high demand products like battery operated mixers and shavers and stuff where you need alot of power but passive devices like what ive used them for they are great and last almost as long as single use (or at least not a noticeable difference). My only advice is to have at least one or two extra pairs than the number of devices you are using because its nice to have a charged set ready to go when you need to replace. that way you just replace the dead with the charged and put the dead ones back on the charger so they are ready for the next swap
This is my first set of rechargeable batteries. Only complaint at this point is the long charge time!
Batteries charge quicker than expected and last as they should. Excellent feeling of ability to reuse and assist in not contributing to landfills.
I am just now buying a new pack of these batteries! They have lasted me about a full year. Only now are thay starting to not work after being charged. That is a long time!! I would recomend these batteries to anyone.
I've had my energizer charger for 5 years now, and I have several sets of these batteries and some AAAs too that last and last. I use them in my car alarm key fob, game controllers, tivo remote, and bluetooth keyboards and mice. The charger I have charges them in a couple hours, and they still perform well after many trips in the charger over the years. I find myself picking up a new set when I get more devices that call for batteries, instead of buying single use batteries.
I use rechargeable batteries on oodles of things, and these energizers looked good because of the name and the high Milli-ampere rating. Unfortunately, I planned on using these on my radar detector, and usually cannot get enough charge on these for the detector to run 30 minutes! Most alkaline batteries will last well over 70 hours of use. My 5 year-old Radio Shack rechargeables (used 100's of times) still give me over 10 hours of use. Just a poor product that is not in following with energizers trademark of power and longevity.
I bought these batteries for my daughter's digital camera when she was going through so many regular ones. They last so long, I'm now buying some for my camera.
I went out to get this product after buying my son a Leappad for Christmas. Any Leappad owner knows that (with 2 kids playing all the time) normal batteries only last 2-3 days and I needed to get that fixed because it was getting expensive to replace 4 batteries that often. After reading many reviews it seemed that the Duracell owners were nowhere near as happy with their product as Energizer owners. I'm more that happy I did take that time and went with this great product. I'm getting 4-5 days of play out of that same Leappad now plus I can toss them back in the 15 minute recharger and right back in the Leappad. I also purchased an 8 pack of extra batteries but havent had to open that yet. I'm sure they will find homes in Wiimotes and other things once the normal batteries die out. Very happy with the charge time. I was a bit skeptical that the 15 minute charge would last a long time but I was dead wrong. I don't fully know the batteries complete life since I just purchased this mid January but I can't imagine that it would be bad with the reviews I've read. With charger adaption to work with your accessory plug in the car this would be great for cameras and road trips as well. I'd almost be surprised if Energizer didn't put themselves out of business with this product. I can't imagine going back to "regular" batteries and depending on their actual life, I'm sure I won't have to buy more for a very long time. WELL worth the cost. I'm sure the Universal Compact version would be a great buy as well but that does take 3-5 hours for a charge. The plus side there would be it recharges ALL batteries but again 3-5 hours made me stick with the quick charge.
I bought this because my rechargeable battery packs for my gaming controllers for the xbox 360 and nintendo wii died out. I bought this because the batteries last longer than the rechargeable battery packs. I also use this for my hobby of r/c cars, planes, and helicopters. radio controlled vehicles go through batteries like no tomorrow. I bought extra battery packs to use for other devices. The good thing about the rechargeable battery charger is that it doesn't take too long to charge the batteries. I also like the fact that it can charge AA and AAA batteries.
Product is fantastic. Have had one for several years. Used it so much, it finally wore out. Besides, it was an older model, worked with new improved batteries, but not as well as the new unit. Only problem, was with Best Buy, ship to store. Received e-mail, that product was available for pick up. Spent an hour, with up to four employees at any given time, looking for one of the five units the computer said was there. Ended up ordering it again, as ship to home. Still, was billed for shipping and handling, until I complained. If you need a superior AA/AAA battery charging system, you can't do better than this. Just make sure that you have it in hand, before you hand them your credit card information.
Just purchased this to start using rechargable batteries for my timer battery powered flicker candles (from QVC) Its great! Charges all 4 AAA's in 30 minutes (just as advertised) and has a good secure holding area for the batteries while they charge. Other models are not made as well and the batteries wiggle thus creating a bad connection and one or more batttery not charging. The fan is louder than I expected but unless you plan to sit and stare at the charger while its charging, you wont notice, especially if you are in another room. Its a small price to pay for such a quick charger - I dont mind at all! Great product!
I love this charger so much I bought 2 additional ones as gifts. It is the only charger that I have located on the market that comes with a wall and car charger within the price range. It is really handy while travelling and the camera dies. The only down side is that there is only one light indicator for all 4 batteries charging, so regardless if there are batteries fully charged you would not know until they are all charged. But hey it only takes 15 minutes so it's a very small issue!! Great investment!!
When i bought my turtle beach x4 headset for the x box 360, i bought this battery charger. The charger is superfast and easy to use. The only thing that i had trouble with is the set comes with 2AA batteries and 2AAA batteries. I only needed AAA batteries. I just thought it would be better if they had a AA set that comes with 4 AA batteries and a AAA set that comes with 4 AAA batteries. The batteries also hold charge for a long time and charge very very fast.
If you have a digital camera or console game such as the XBox 360, you NEED a AA battery charger. The charge is fast (15 to 30) minutes, and the batteries hold the charge even with my heavy digital camera use. The price may seem high, but it's a good deal when you include the 4 free 2500ma rechargeable batteries. My only complaint is that the fan is loud, but a strong fan may be a requirement for a unit that charges batteries this fast (rapid charging generates quite a bit of heat).
Rechargeable batteries have come a long ways! This set from Energizer has a great charge time of 15 minutes. The unit may be a little pricier than some, but is worth it. The only thing that is different from my last set which was Monster brand is that there is a little fan sound that runs while it's operating and it does have an adapter instead of the plug right on the back of the unit. Not too big of a deal. The car adapter option is nice as well for charging while traveling.
This is a great investment. I've got a Canon S5IS, that takes four of these babies, and I sure wasn't going to buy new batteries every other day. The only batteries that would even hold up would the the lithium camera batteries, at $12+ a pack. This comes with 2200 mAh batteries. You can get 2500, which should last even a little longer. I used the camera for 3+ days on the included batteries. I sat there testing them, by taking picture after picture after picture with the flash on for a lot of it, and they lasted, by my estimation, 6-8 hours of on/use time. I really couldn't believe it. Then, after those finally died, I put them in the charger, and 20 minutes later it was off, and they were completely charged. Another plus, is that this comes with a car adapter for your cig lighter, or extra terminal, so if you're on a trip somewhere, take a few sets of batteries, and never run out. Or, in 15 minutes you can be using the same set again. Definately reccomend.
These are so necessary for people in the age of all things digital! I have a camera, mp3 player, headphones, and tons of other items that need batteries, and it is just NOT worth it to spend money on alkalines. While the rechargable batteries do not have as much juice (and therefore, don't last as long) they are quick and easy to recharge, and then you're back in action! Great money saver!
As a professional photographer I need to have long lasting batteries all the time. Anyone that shoots in the coldest of cold weather as I often do know that Lithium-Ion Batteries go dead within just a few shots. These Energizer batteries really do go on and on..and it sure beats the 4 hours the Lithium-Ion Batteries need to charge.. Get these batteries you wont be sorry..I wont use anything else when I shoot!!
It seems all I ever do is charge the batteries. They do not hold a charge. After a full charge I put them in a remote or a Kodak Camera, and they are dead in a matter of no time. Played with it numerous times reread the instruction, to no avail. Simple are very weak batteries a lot of recharging. Not worth the money I paid for them. Working it's way t the trash bin!
I have two of these batteries. One came with the camcorder and I bought the other separately. They are both a few years old now and still performing well.
Energizer Rechargeable Lithium-Ion Batteries are always less expensive than generic brands and qualty is equivalent as generic ones.
I have purchased 3 of these batteries to replace in my Motorola 5.8GHZ handsets. Used these to replace the old Ni-Cad battery type. Never had a problem with these batteries, long lasting, takes and holds a good charge. HIGHLY recommended. Just make sure that you check the compatibility list before you buy. It's listed with the details of this product.
I check to make sure it would fit my phone before purchasing & it does not work.
Tough to write a review on a battery, but I'll try. Compared to the three year old battery in the phone, this one holds charge and lasts ten times as long. So far, it appears as though the battery freshness is good. Not much else to say.
DOES NOT CHARGE...I just bought a new Samsung HMX-H100 camcorder and i decided to get an extra battery for it. Seeing that this states "Replaces Samsung IA-BP85ST" BATTERY i decided to buy it. I got home and started to charge it only to notice that the charge light was not turning on, so i decided to open the LCD but the charge icon didn't show up either. I let it charge for about 2 hours to see if anything changed. I even used a different outlet. Nothing though. I then thought that i could test to see if it was charged by recording something only to quickly have it run out of battery. Anyone thinking of replacing their SAMSUNG HMX-H100, H104, H105, H106 battery should try a different battery. I think this problem is the same for all of High-Def Samsung camcorders.
EVEN THE BB ASSOCIATE SAID IT WON'T WORK BUT TRY IT. SHE HERSELF TRIED IT BUT IT FAILED IN HER CAMERA ALSO. SHE TRIED SEVERAL BATTERIES (SAME REPLACEMENT #) BUT ALL FAILED TO CHARGE.
Bought a package deal from bestbuy.com that included this battery for my Samsung SC-MX20 camera. Tried 3 batteries, none worked. It says it replaces the Samsung IA-BP85ST battery (the correct model that came with my camera and works fine) but it didn't even turn on or charge. DON'T BUY THIS BATTERY!
I got this for one of my kids toys. I have had it in and had no issues. I think I am more worried about the noises still lasting then the battery
The package says they last 8 times longer...... I'm proof they go beyond that! I bought these for my Dre Beats and 2 batteries lasted over 3 months!! And I use my Beats for approximately 3-5 hours a day, 6-7 days a week. Worth the extra few bucks.
I looked all over for these batteries and finally found them at Best Buy. I needed them for a special flash light I have. Good value
It was a great value purchase. But the battery life expired pretty quickly for a standard usage around a low appliance use. Great for standard toys, appliances, mouse, keyboard etc. But not for it's battery life.
i think they are good because they are rechargable
Nimh batteries are inherently only 1.2 volts. When manufacturers make their devices, these devices are "expecting" 1.5 volts such as what is provided by Alkaline batteries. So your "low battery" warning, if your device has one, will trigger much much sooner since your battery is starting at 1.2 volts vs. 1.5 volts. Further, the 15 minute Energizer charger charges at an astronomical 7 Amps! This gets the batteries crazy hot. Heat is not good for batteries and they will die (i.e. - not be able to recharge anymore) much sooner = DEFINITELY NOT the "recharge 100 times" claim. So add the more expensive cost of these batteries, the cost to charge them at 7 amps (which I can imagine is a lot since refrigerators draw 15 amps!), and the fact that the 15 minute chargers kill them more quickly, it should really push you to go back to Alkalines. So in a nutshell, I'm going back to Alkalines. Or even better, go with Lithium Energizers which will last that much longer!
These batteries are perfect for the energizer 15 minute battery charger. I only needed 2 batteries and i wish these would come in packs of 2 so i could have saved a few bucks. I would reccomend these batteries only with an energizer battery charger.
This product is such a money saver. These batteries have saved me a fortune with reuse. MP3 players and portable speakers eat up batteries, so this product repays for it self fast. They hold a long life with most electronics.
This is a fairly good value for the money. Not the best but good.
Batteries are great in my guitar tuner. They are exactly as described.
duracells lasted about half as long as these, there grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrreat, sorry needed 50 letters lol
good price on the batteries and in line with discount stores
Very pleased with this product. I always buy this type of battery for everything.
What is there to say; it's a battery and needed for SLR camera.
Replacement battery for my Motorola MD671 Cordless phone. The original battery finally died and the new replacement battery seems be working great. I have no idea on the durability since I have only had the battery for about a month but the talk time has increased to at least several hours. Have not had to interrupt a call to recharge. Battery cost is average but did not want to buy a whole new phone system so it was worth it to me.
These are really nice batteries and have good value for their price.
Love the fact that they are lighter then the average battery and have a lot better refresh rate if you use it in a flash. They last a lot longer as well. Very well worth buying and future cost savings since you won't have to replace batteries a fast.
I recently purchased these batteries for my new Nikon L110 I must say that these are worth the price and you do not have to worry if your batteries are going to die on the special event your at, Overall If I'd were you do not hesitate to spend the money on them. Beats Alkaline!!!
I have several outdoor weather stations that send continuous (every 3 seconds) wireless updates to an indoor receiver that is several walls and rooms away from where the signal enters straightline into the house. These batteries perform from -25 degree F to 90 degrees F and typically last for over a full year before needing to be changed. Great when the weather station is on a pole 8+ feet above the ground (no fun to change batteries in mid-winter). I actually change out after 15-months before cold weather sets in so I won't have to think about it in a cold Minnesota winter. These batteries also work great in handheld GPS receivers used for hiking (don't want it to quit out on the trail with kids) and geocaching, as well as for many motorized devices that use AAs. Very impressed with the long life of these batteries.
works long and is well worth it. we bought an eight pack and it has lasted us about three months if not longer. it is good investment.
I've own several battery chargers over the years, Rayovac, Duracell, and these energizer ones seem to last longer. I normally don't go through tons of batteries, but it eliminates buying them often.
Its worth buying if you use batteries constantly. Instead of buying new batteries every time, just buy these and when they dies just recharge them. It is a smart economic decision.
these rechargable batteries are well worth the price my daughter uses them for her leap pad game system and the charge last for several weeks with her useing it every day for about 2 hours...
I had bought a charger similar to this one from radio shack where the charger itself was excellent quality but the batteries were junk. I bought this one to replace the other since as a package deal the charger is a few bucks mnore than just buying the batteries alone. The charger is junk, batteries fall out of it if you can believe it. On a scale of 1 - 10, i give it a 2. Dont get me wrong, it'll do the job, but there's definately better out there
I use these batteries for my wireless gaming headset and I can get a good amount of gaming in before batteries need replacing. Easy to use, no issues so far.
The product is very good. Better then most chargers. I am a thrifty shopper and without the rewards program I would not have purchased this based on price. The item works great and would recommend to others. The best feature is how is shuts off when batteries are fully charged so one can forget about it without a risk.
compact, plugs directly to outlets no extension cord and charges up to 4 batteries at a time aa or aaa batteries and cost is just right.
this is a great charger and set of batteries, batteries last long and don't take long to charge at all- charger easy to travel with
its good for the money n i like it.. i might recommend someone to buy it
The Energizer 2025 lithium battery is a quality product.. They may cost a bit more but they are quite dependable. They have a technical shelf life of 5 years, however it is not uncommon for the batteries to last far longer than that, sometimes 8-10 years. I use these to power pcmcia cards for a tc electronics guitar processor, and the first set I got lasted 10 years, the second set 8 and are still cranking, but I will soon replace them because I am sure they are at the end of the product lifespan and I cannot afford to lose my data, which is what will happen if I keep them in the pcmcia cards till they give up the ghost. I would buy these again (and will buy another 5 of these soon, cause the second set is about near the end) in a heartbeat and would recommend these to a friend. Excellent product. I would rather pay 6 dollars for a pair of these and have them last 8-9 years, than have to pay 2$ each for 3 pairs of these repetitavely over the course of 9 years, and have to replace them every 24 months. Al
I use these batteries for my tiny 8-9" TV remotes. I like a small TV next to my computer so I can watch shows and do computer work at the same time.
Great battery for my 3d glasses last more than the competitor
Gets the job done, its a battery after all. Can find better prices online pretty easily.
They are batteries what can you say. I got a charge out of buying them!
I agree with the previous posters that these batteries do not last as long as Energizer standard C batteries. However, I use them primarily in a baby swing that sucks through 4 C batteries a week! I simply remove the batteries and put them in the charger every other day while we all sleep. The next morning, I remove them and place them in the swing again. Sure, it adds 5 minutes to my routine every other day, but they have saved me at least $50 so far and counting...
Many manufacturers are now simply taking a AA battery and putting it in a larger shell, and that is true for this battery. You are NOT getting a full C-cell mAh rating, you are getting a AA battery rating. They do put that rating on the battery, but the average consumer won't notice that it's the same as the AA battery. A decent C-cell rechargeable should be over 6000mAh if it's real. There are many "shells" available for AA batteries to use them as a C or D cell replacement. If that works for you, there's no sense paying for these as AA batteries are easier to find and are more of a standard with today's devices..
This is just an awful battery. Before purchasing, please pick up a 2-pack of this battery and compare the weight to a regular 2-pack battery. These batteries simply have no juice. I bought these with the idea of saving money of batteries, this is simply a waste. Batteries last 2-3 days with regular use at best. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS BATTERY.
I purchased these batteries because I was tired of other brand batteries that were advertised as long-lasting pooping out too soon. I use batteries for a large variety of products including my noise suppression headphones. I was having to replace the batteries far to frequently. I picked up a set of these and was genuinely surprised at how long they did last. Where others would drop in two or three days of use, this model kept going and going for several more days beyond the two or three. I finally had to replace the battery when I forgot to turn the headphones off after use.
I bought them because the other batteries that I was using were runing out in only a few weeks, With these at least I can get a few months out of them before replacing them.
I thought that this item did what I wanted it to do, which was to recharge rechargable batteries.
This charger is one of the most economical purchases I've ever made. Do you have a baby or toddler? If so, you should own one of these, they recharge everything from the baby swing, crib aquarium to all of those battery operated toys requiring the "AA/AAA's", "C's", D's and even the annoying 9V's......you name it, this charger has you covered. We also use these rechargeables in many of our household items; wireless mice, digital picture frames, carbon monoxide/smoke detectors, flashlights, remote controls, gaming controls, clocks.............the list goes on and on. As a buyer, we are using them at our business and saving thousands all while being green and alleviating waste from our landfills.
This has been great to have at the office it charges more batteries at one time and lets you know when the batteries are bad. I would definitly recommend it.
I've been using this charger for over a year now and it still works great. I can charge my batteries in a very quick amount of time compared to other chargers. We need to charge batteries for walkie talkies at a camp, so we use it at least twice a day. Still going strong. We never had any problems with our hinge. If the hinge breaks, take it back and exchange it. It's worth the trouble if you need to charge a lot and quickly.
Out of the package the hinge would not stay closed. I have to hold it closed with a fairly heavy object every time I want to charge. That being said, it does charge well, but having the broken hinge is a big inconvienence.
This is one of the few chargers that actually works after a few months of heavy use. The quick charger just sucks and this does pretty fast charging itself. Durable and can charge alot of batteries at the same time. I bought this mainly to charge 9v batteries for my guitars and it works great!!!!!! Best charger I've owned.
works great, charges quickly, nice size unit, not to big, charges different size rechargeable batteries
The hinge broke the first week. Now I have to place something on the lid to hold it down. This is a common defect for this model
In my experience this is the ONLY Energizer charger worth my money. I started with 2 wall plug chargers both fail to recognize batteries often. Then i got the 2 rapid chargers, they report half of my batteries defective (blinking light). I tried the family charger with the clear plastic top, it worked for one day. Good thing I kept my receipt. Got this one, the most expensive model. WORKS GREAT. Even charges the batteries that the rapid charger just "blinks" at glad I saved them. F.Y.I. - My household uses a lot of AA batteries 4 Wii motes 4 Xbox 360 controllers & 4 automatic air fresheners doing the most damage.
this product broke in two days it wont light up when power is put to it now do not buy this item they make a cheaper model and i am going to give it a whirl and see what happens if it works good will add comments to this review
In my opinion this is very bad product. Simply it doesn't work. When I try to recharge batteries it looks like that everything is working and after about half hour it reports that batteries are full. Batteries after this are not full and only way to have at least working batteris is to open and close several time this recharger to start recharging again and again. If you leave batteries for one day batteries will be empty...
Great device for being able to charge many different types of nickel metal hydide batteries.
My old charger died and I needed one that could charge AA, AAA, and 9V batteries. This is one of the few that charges 9V batteries. It has worked fine so far, with a nice display that shows the status.
In response to the short lifespan between charges I offer this. If you look at the mAh rating of these, they are only 2500 which is similar to that of a good AA rechargable battery. These, as are most others, are merely a AA battery in a D shell. What you need is a D cell that is at least a 10,000MAh rating. That will equate to a regular D cell battery that you would expect. You can Google 10,000mAh D cell on the internet and find multiple places that have them.
I got a new worksite radio for christmas. Week after I went to my local Best Buy and bought 8 of these batteries for the unit. Came home, charged them and went to my worksite the next morning. 3 hours later the music stopped, the batteries were done. First thought, I got some bad batteries. At home that night I recharged, and thought maybe I should return them, and exchange. I checked this site, and then a few others and realized I had spent $51.00 on D batteries that have the power of AA batteries. I still had all the packaging and reciept, took it allback and Best Buy would not refund my purchase, they donot except returned batteries. Even if they are rechargable, less than 48 hours old, and have a lousey rating on their site. I ordered better batteries elsewhere. And a combo dvd/vcr, I guess Best Buy is off tmy list. They are selling junk here.
I am surprised Energizer makes this product, they should be embarrassed. I recently became a 1st time father and bought these batteries for all of my son's toys. What a waste. My wife and I have to charge these batteries every other day. I would not sell these to my worst enemy, just a horrible product.
Don't waste your money on these, at 2400 mAh they are more like AA in a D casing
I bought them about a year ago and I was so satisfied with them that I bought some more this time. They recharge fast with the Energizer 15-minute recharger and they last a decent amount of time in digital cameras and other portable electronics.
needed to replace the battery in an old portable phone. found this. fair price. easy to charge and install. has extended the use of the phone.
We have shot around 200 pictures (about 70 with flash) and are still on the origional batteries. Very impressive
using this brand in my mouse for a few years now - lasts longer than the copper top battery.
over 400 videos and pictures and these batteries lasted the duration of my daughter's trip to Costa Rica
...they shipped this little pack of batteries into a huge cardboard box, and wasted a ton of materials.
Energizer is the Battery we all use in our Toys or games at our house and always has ben!!!
I use these batteries in my autostart car remote. I can usually get a over 1 year worth of use out of a set of batteries with no problems (and I use it alot every day!). The only problem is my remote takes three batteries, so I am left with one extra battery. I wish they sold one single battery.
I use the batteries for my remote start and keyless entry. The batteries have a great life.
I've owned a Panasonic Cordless phone I use primarily is speaker mode for 8+ years. This is the second replacement battery in that time. Excellent performance. This morning I've been on a conference call for 5 hours now, and while it has gone down to 1 (of 3) bars on battery, it has yet to start warning me that it may be nearing the end. I can't ask for more than that.
I was tired of replacing batteries in our cordless phones and decided to give this a try. Definitely works in place of the Ni-Cd and seems to have better talk and standby time. Time will tell if it is worth the extra money, but it is definitely a quality product.
I've owned a Panasonic KX-TG2730S cordless phone for several years now, and have been through several batteries. I would always buy the standard Ni-Cad batteries, and if I left the phone off the charger, the battery would die fairly quickly. I decided to give this NiMH battery a go, and I'm glad I spent the extra money. The charges last MUCH longer, and the phone doesn't suddenly and mysteriously die like it did with previous batteries. If you need a new battery for your phone, don't waste your time on the cheaper ones. This one is _totally_ worth the extra money.
Two batteries cost almost as much as the whole phone system did. The "life" indicator on the phone does not get to one bar before the phone shuts off. Therefore I am not sure how well the battery actually works.
I have read other reviews about this battery not working properly. I have had no problem with it. I did buy it at bestbuy.com, as it was less expensive than in the store.
Gave it a chance to fully charge and see no difference between it and the original for a fraction of the cost. It works just as well.
This is the only type of battery for my cordless phones. If this battery is installed correctly and allowed to charge for a full 24 hours prior to use it will preform as expected.
Purchased this to replace panasonic battery pack in 5-year old cordless phone. Worked for less than one week. Now when showing fully charged, if I try to make a call there is an error message about no link to base, even if I am about 10 inches from the base. I should have heeded the other reviews that reported similar behavior.
After putting new batteries in, with the battery showing a full charge,the phone will cut off in middle of conversation with the message "lost connection to base unit". Put phone on base and battery shows only one bar. Put old batteries back in and the phone works fine.
I purchased this to replace an aging panasonic battery. It doesn't seem to hold the charge very well. I use the panasonic battery for several hours and it gives me a warning that the battery is running low. The energizer just dies. It shows full and then click, you loose a connection and then you put it on the charger and check again and it shows only one bar. Anyway, I bought two and have put the original panasonic battery back in and am much happier.
I needed a battery for an old Panasonic cordless phone. I bought this so that I could pick up at the store but even that was complicated
Energizer batteries have been great source of power for all my electronics
Easy to use and fairly good life per charge. Good to know ill always have working batteries with a quick charge.
Used these (and their AA version) in my camera and as another reviewer stated they replaced a multitude of regular alkaline cells. It is nice to be able to grab the camera and not have to worry about looking around for batteries all the time. In the GPSr (hand held type) I've gone from a set of batteries barely lasting a day to lasting a few weeks.
I was excited to buy this battery thinking is would last a long time, but turns out this battery only lasted me a couple of hours. I've bought a few these batteries of thinking maybe that one battery was just defective. But they all are the same. Only lasting two hours.
My camera can eat a set of Energizer Max AA in about 20 photos or 1 day. With these I can run for months without ever thinking about my batteries, I don't have to change them every week on vacation, I can take more than 20 or 25 pictures without haveing to fumble through my wife's bag to find new batteries. It seems expensive, but will save you lots of money and LOADS of time!
I was really disappointed. I thought I would get a visit from the pink bunny. These Energizer batteries are the best in the whole world. Different than any other Energizer batteries any where.... on the whole planet......really!
I need them for a travel alarm clock.When I have energize batteries in the clock there is no need to worry about my clock needing batteries every week.
Works for long and is cheap!! what more can you ask for...
I don't use my remote security device for my car that often, yet this battery lasted less than four months which is horrible.
Bought these for use in a digital camera and after two months they are still going strong!
I have always had many items requiring AA batteries and now many of our new LED lights use the AAA type batteries. The most used battery powered item is a salt and pepper grinder set using 6-AAA batteries each. These are used each time we cook so I had to memory what lifespan was prior to these lithium units. These new Lithium batteries put out much more power as well as last longer. Our grinders seem to have bigger motors as a result and spin much faster, and batteries last much longer. In addition my LED AA and AAA flashlights exhibit much more power in the beams they extend in the dark. I keep flashlights in our vehicles but have not yet determined if 106* heat affects the lithium any differently but I suspect these will perform in a superior manner there as well. Worth the added expense....good stuff !
This is a test review and will be removed when completed.
I found it to have more power than a regular battery. a little expensive.
I use these batteries for my digital camera--works great & quick
Gotta luv these! Tired of being caught without batteries for your remotes, game controllers, etc...?! Do yourself and the earth a favor use rechargeable batteries! Save some money in your wallet and have batteries when you need them ALL THE TIME!!!
I really can't say enough about how bad these batteries are. Please note that I'm a mechanical engineer by schooling and have been somewhat of a "battery aficionado" for 30 years or so with my charging and discharging experience of batteries for my hobbies (radio control, cars, cameras, electronics, etc). Nimh batteries are inherently only 1.2 volts. When manufacturers make their devices, these devices are "expecting" 1.5 volts such as what is provided by Alkaline batteries. So your "low battery" warning, if your device has one, will trigger much much sooner since your battery is starting "fresh" at 1.2 volts vs. 1.5 volts. Further, the 15 minute Energizer charger charges at an astronomical 7 Amps! This gets the batteries crazy hot. Heat is not good for batteries and they will die (i.e. - not be able to recharge anymore) much sooner = DEFINITELY NOT the "recharge 100 times" claim. Of course, if you use a "slow" charger, then yes, the batteries should last much longer. Charge over 100 times? I doubt it. So why shouldn't you buy these batteries? 1) Add the more expensive cost of these batteries 2) The cost to charge them at 7 amps (which I can imagine is a lot since refrigerators draw 15 amps!) 3) The fact that the 15 minute chargers kill them more quickly, it should really push you to go back to Alkalines. 4) They don't work as well as Alkalines in colder weather (i.e. - try using the flash when it's 15 degrees outside and you'll notice that the batteries, although freshly charged, won't work so well. Pop new Alkalines in there and voila! You got flash back). So in a nutshell, I'm going back to Alkalines. Or even better, go with Lithium Energizers which will last that much longer! Both don't contain any mercury and you can safely throw them in the trash.
These batteries will not hold a charge very long. Their self-discharge rate is absolutely awful. If I fully charge them, then store them for a week or two in a drawer, they are completely drained. Also, they failed to power a remote controlled car even when fully charged.
I have had these batteries for about 5 years...I use them all the time. It was the best buy I ever made! I use these in my digital camera and they will last almost the whole day. I have the Energizer CH30MN charger...it takes about 15 minutes for a full charge. I agree in saying that if you don't like these batteries, it HAS to be the charger that you are using to charge them. Great BUY!!!!
This batteries are good, but you need to give them the time to charge well (8 to 13 hours) I have a 4 hours fast charger and the original from Energizer (~8 hours) and you can notes the difference with the full charge. I use them with my canon and sigma flashes, and I love to take pictures, day and night with flash (you can see a nice touch in day light) and I have to say that 4 hour quick charge is just a QUICK CHARGE, do not last long... Do not charge 100%. and after using all the energy from the battery, takes up to 13 hours to fully charge. Bottom line, I recommend this batteries to a friend, but, only if he/you get the right charger for it. Hey, full charge... priceless.
I have used a 'heavy duty industrial, low-impedance' line of rechargeable batteries & a 'pro' charger for years. The charger is about 3x the cost of consumer models & usually found through battery distributors. I was skeptical about purchasing these batteries for household use after being used to industrial battery performance. If you are not getting satisfactory results from these batteries it mite be the charger. There are differences in the charging units and even though the charger says that the battery is full, it can only charge the cell to its own charging capacity. If you have a 2700 mah battery, your charger has to be able to charge it to that capacity, if isnt able to - the battery performance will suffer. It is also important to 'condition' the batteries rather than continuously rapid charging them. Digital cameras are notoriously high drain because they also power the flash as well as the camera. I condition these batteries in the above mentioned charger and get great results from them in a point and shoot Canon digital camera. They dont drain over time (weeks) and offer fast camera flash recycle time.
These batteries worked good at first for my digital camera and were very convenient being rechargeable, but they didn't last nearly as long as I thought they would. These are good, but run out very fast if using in something like a digital camera.
when it comes to rechargeable NiMH batteries, I have tried a few different brands, and get about the same results from all of them. But it just matters how much charge they can hold. So, I usually go for the ones with the digest Milliamp-hours (mAh). And Energizer is one highest rates ones I have seen, plus it is a name brand I trust. (Though, there are some I have seen that goes up to 2500). But to date I have yet to have ny problems with mt Energizers in my wireless mouse or camera.
I got these a long time ago with a charger and i still use them today. I have used them with my camera, with my game controllers and in a lot of other things. Once you have these and ac harger they quickly pay for themselves!
Needed a backup battery for my Nikon. Only a few shots, and this thing is done. Cannot recharge. Taking back to get a real battery.
I bought this battery for one of my Unidens and works right out of the box. This battery is still holding charge for over a year and return it to the charger whenever I run low.
They have such a HUGE markup on some of their items, almost to the point of gouging. Guess I should have done a little research first before I grabbed two of them at the store. Heck, I think as much as I paid for the batteries was about half the price of the phone itself when I first bought it...and it came with two batteries.
The original batter that came with my Uniden phone lasted 2 years. I replaced it with this energizer model from my local Best Buy. Unfortunately, in less than 6 months, I have to replace this battery. Even if it shows a full charge, it will last for only a few minutes of talking. I work from home and do all my business by phone so I do work these phones very hard some days. I have multiple phones (which work great!) that I must use in a typical day in my office as the Energizer battery will not hold it's charge. I'll get an OEM battery next.
I needed a backup battery for my wireless microphone. I ended up getting 2 of these and I'm glad I did... It does the job and makes me worry a lot less about my power solutions for my devices...
I charged the battery fully and then wanted to wait for it to die completely before charging it again...That took about 2 weeks! I charged it fully once again and its been off the charging station for a week and a half already. Works great!
My fiance uses this battery in her blood sugar kit so she needs it to be reliable and it is. Good batter.
LCD display keeps you up to the batteries charging status. Nice way to know when to stop charging.
I only have one 360 controller, so having 4 batteries really is nice since I;ll be using 2, and the other 2 are charged and ready to go!
i just got this charger to replace my old one and batteries also. my old charger 16hrs to charge 2450mh batteries and i gotta say that this is a charger that i love. its $20 for the charger that only takes 4hrs not 8 like is sister charger or 16hrs. this is the best value for anyone who has electronics that are battery hogs or are tired of needing need batteries all the time. this is the way to go 100's of charges. the only thing to keep in mind is with a faster charger like this they kill batrerys faster. so theirs advantages and disadvantages that must be addressed before buying. finally theirs an lcd screen so you know the status not indicator lights which are a pain.
Energizer is the way to go when it comes to rechargable batteries. They offer a variety of different types of batteries that are recargable.
I bought this for a Kodak point and shoot digital camera. On a full charge, you only get about 25 shots out of the batteries.
Very Nice, good performance ! Nice stile, i do recomendly
Does what it is suppose to do. No problems at all.
Title explains all. The performance and life of the batteries, as well as the charger, are excellent. It's definitely worth the money. Bought this for my Nikon L120 and it does what it should.
I bought a similiar battery charger from Energizer over 4 years ago and after thousands of pictures I have to finally replace the batteries. This small charger is such a great value I am going to buy another and put this one in the basement with the Wii controlers. This has been a durable and long lasting product. WORTH the money. We bought the 39.99 15 minute charger and it was just that 15 minutes to a full charge and it had a car adapter for times we were on the road.
these batterys last very long. they hold their charge time very good. they have paid for themselves at least 4 times over and are still going strong.
Charge in a great amount of time, and hold their charge for a while.
I have a Persian rug that unfortunately my dog urinated on. I vacuumed the rug, spread the cleaning powder on it, vacuumed it again and it's a new rug.
Gucci Guilty will compliment your pheremones
This is a fresh scent most give me headaches but I could smell this all day I absolute love it on my hubby.
This is the only high end bodywash I buy! It is worht the money. I only use it on special occasions becuase of the price. A little goes a long way!
I use the watch on a daily basis

                            the watch is a clean classic looking watch.

                            one of the hands fell off now i have to send it in to fossil.
This watch looks great and goes with alot but the face is huge and can hurt your wrist if you wear it too high up on your arm.
This Fossil watch was a gift to myself for earning my first job. The watch may seem pricey, however the overall quality of the watch and style is hard to beat. Fossil is a tremendous brand that will last you for a while. So instead of getting little cheap watches, invest in one that will last and will enjoy looking at the time.

                            I use this watch for work to keep me on track of clocking in and breaks. This watch is also helpful for style, wearing a grey Calvin Klein outfit wit this watch will get you noticed. This watch is also great for my workouts because its not too big and keeps me on track of my workouts.
Love this boot so much (I also have it in the black), that I bought both for my daughter, who loves them equally as well. We can't wait to wear them. I am a confirmed UGGS girl and live in them during Fall, Winter and Spring. If I had to choose one pair of shoes or boots to wear for the rest of my life it certainly would be UGG. By the way, they would last you a whole lifetime! Thank you, K.M. from Connecticut
I received these boots yesterday and fell in love once I took them out of the box. These UGGs are well worth the money and one of a kind. I also ordered a Black sparkle pair, they are also very pretty. I can't wait till cooler weather so I can show these bad boys off! You will not regret this purchase!
They are cute and go with any outfit! Such a fabulous trend!!
I love to wear my uggs everywhere. The only thing I found troublesome about the boots it the picture of the product online is MUCH, MUCH lighter than the boots really are. It is not a very big deal, because the boots are still pretty, but it was interesting to see how much the color differs.

                            Another tip: Spritz your boots with the sheepskin protective spray before wearing them. It helps so much. I am so glad Santa brought me these boots! They are overall wonderful shoes  :)
smells goodall you need is a dabnever clogswalmart has the product, other should but don'tavailable at walmart at best price
Just need one pump to clean all your dishes
Have been searching for this product; it is without a doubt, the best stove cleaner on the market - and it is so so easy - just spray it on, let it set and the cooked on junk just comes off. I use it for the grates on my stove and the Power Dissolver makes them look like new.
BTW, I couldn't find this product at Target or the grocery store, only Walmart seems to have it around here. I also told my sister and she couldn't find it at the Walmart near her home. I hope this doesn't go off the market, and that they don't change the formulation, because it works so great as it is!
My name is Barb and really would prefer this stay on the market.
Dawn Power dissolver literally melts hard, baked-on, crusty grease and requires less "elbow grease" than most cleansers. GO FOR IT! IT REALLY DOES THE JOB!
Love it, just wish it was easier to find!
I don't use this on dishes, but its the best thing I have ever tried for getting grease stains out of my kids school uniforms
This works great in my oven. Works better than easy off. Better for animals too. When oven is cooling off just spray some on the cooked on food and it comes off easily. Don't know what I would do with out this stuff. I buy it by the case full.
I read that this product would be great to clean cookie sheets. It did not work the cookie sheets are still mess.
No wonder stores took this product off the shelves! It certainly does not live up to the "Dawn Detergent" reputation.I thought this was like a laundry stain remover; just for dishware. Wrong!
This stuff doesn't just do dishes, pots and pans. I find that is works excellent on my shower doors and other surfaces around the house that are tricky to clean. I am glad I was able to find it online because it seems to have been discontinued in stores. I hope Walmart always carries it in the future. I should have stocked up.
This is great. I use it to clean my smoker.
Dawn Power Dissolver helps get the stuck and burned on gunk from the pans under the electric burners (reflectors). It also gets burned on food off of baking pans; just let it soak and then the burned gunk usually just washes off with minimal scraping. I have used it in the past and was glad to find it online at Walmart.
I use it to get tough grease stains out of clothes...its hard to find...
Great for cutting burned on stains/grease on the stove. I also use it on some bowls that I use for popcorn to get the butter stains out. Gets build up off of pots & pans,
great product - have used for many years - only available, now, online
This product is awesome. I bought this because I was looking for something to take ink out of my dryer. This worked perfectly, it took it off with very little effort. I have since then used it on my stove, pans, grout, grill and tub surround. I am a Realtor and will be putting a bottle of this in my house warming baskets. This is a must when moving into a not so clean house, the tub surrounds look like new with very little scrubbing.
This works better than any other product that I have tried for presoaking burnt on grease on everything, not just dishes.
I think this is one of the greatest products ever. It is the only thing I've found that removes cooking spray from pots and bakeware. Also removes baked on grease. I even use it to clean my oven since it's not as harsh as the oven cleaners. Fabulous.
I have used dawn power dissolver for years and still love it!! It has taken ink out of vinyl tablecloths (f.y.i. Any aresol can of hairspray will take ink out of anything). I spray it in my oven, let it sit for a couple minutes and the gunk in my oven wipes right out (i use a steel wool sos pad with it and theres no scrubbing. I spray it on counters to get stains out... It's phenomenal!!!!
This product cuts through baked on grease like nothing I have ever used. I was on vacation & purchased some for my neice to show her how great it was. It took the baked off grease on her burners & they looked fantastic. I must admit, we had to do it a couple of times but it was worth it. She called to tell me she recommended it to a lady in WalMart while they were standing in line.When I wanted to purchase more I had to send for it since neither of the WalMarts near me stock it so to be safe I ordered 4 bottles. Spray it on, let it set & baked on grease is gone!! Love it.
As others have said, works great on stove tops. I haven't tried it on laundry. Best little cleaner I've ever had!
I've tried many products to clean the greasy baked on crud that accumulates around the burners on the stove top. This is fantastic! Spray, let sit for 10 minutes and away it goes with a swipe of a sponge. It's the best.
i love this product, it gets your pots and pans and any glass dishes so clean. just like new!i have a white kitchen sink that tends to get stains, and i have used this to clean them. much better than bleach or clensers. cuts down on cleaning time. a great product.
This product is the answer to my prayers. I have a Wolf range that I could not get clean but this product did the trick. I had to apply it a couple of time but it is the ONLY thing that has worked and I have tried EVERYTHING. Stock up on it because it is hard to get.
This stuff is the best!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I wish it was sold in the local walmart stores so I didnt have to order it on line but it is worth ever penny it cost!!!!!!!!!!
This product is terrific at getting off baked on foods and grease. A couple of sprays, let it sit for a bit and it will remove baked on food better than soaking overnight. It is rarely if ever on the shelves of any supermarket. Had to go online to get it, but it was worth it.
This is the worlds best cleaner ( especially for owners of rental units ). When you HAVE to clean up after others you CAN NOT BEAT this product. I can't explain why it is so hard to find. It cleans baked on grease build up better than ANY STOVE CLEANER. Why don't more stores carry this product. Its economical and a very dependable cleaner for most everything that comes in contact with grease (whether fresh or baked on). WONDERFUL ............. I RECCOMMEND THIS TO ALL MY FRIENDS ............ ONLY 1 PROBLEM ..............YOU HAVE A VERY HARD TIME FINDING IT IN A STORE................PLEASE , TELL YOUR STORE TO START CARRYING DAWN POWER SCRUBBER.......
I brought this product cause I had read an article that it can remove underarm stains. I have used it on my scrub tops for work, work out clothes everyday and dress shirts and it does exactly that. spray it on let it sit for an hour wash like normal and see that the stain is GONE! As far as dishes it's ok. I haven't seen it do anymore then my regular dish detergent and letting the dish soak would do
I really like this product. I use it to soak off greese and burnt on food off of my pots and pans. Good for grills too. Only wish that the Walmart store in Madison carried this product so I would not lhave to order on-line and pay for shipping. No other store around carries this product.
This product is so helpful in cleaning up greasy dishes, serving dishes, drip pans and even my cook stove. My only problem finding it in the store in the spray bottle and having it in stock. So,when I do find it I buy 10 so, I don't run out.
This is the best cleaning product that I have ever used. It not only cleans greasy dishes. It is good on fabric stains, blood, grass stains etc. It is hard to find in the stores, so I order it by the case.
This is the best cleaner, by far, I have ever used. Here lately, I have been unable to find it so I guess I'll have to buy in online. I can't believe they have pulled this from shelves. This is the ONLY way I can easily clean my microwave oven. I just spray it on to baked on grit and wait a bit, then I just easily wipe it off. Spray cooked on baking pans before putting them in the dishwasher and they come clean every time. This is the most incredible stuff ever!
This product works so so good. I own a very busy deli and my pots and pans are spotless because of this product. Spray it on...wait a few minutes and sponge it clean. I love it!!
This product even cleans old pans. I highly recommend it.
This product is great for removing baked on canola oil & baked on cooking spray. It is the only way I have found to remove baked on oils without a lot of scrubbing. I'm surprised that it isn't in stores anymore. It is a little pricey as a cleaner, but it works.
The Dawn power disolver is a great product, I was able to clean my pancake griddle to almost new. This was the only safe product i found to do such an amazing job. I certainly hope that it will always be available, as I have found many good products just seem to disapper after a period of time. I also cleaned my oven with this product, a plus over some oven cleaners and much safer to use.
Dawn Power Dissolver is the best grease cutting product out there, not just for dishes, but I use it to clean grease off lawnmower and chainsaws.
This is a product that REALLY works! I had tried everything with poor results until I tried this. I have never seen a product remove burned on grease as well as this one does.
This is a great product to have on hand when it come to bake on dishes it get them clean with no hard scrubbing but I wish that all wal-mart it on their selves so I would not have to go on line to find it
This works great on cleaning the rack on the barbecue grill. Spray it on, let it set, and rinse it clean. Most of the time it doesn't require any scrubbing.
I have used this for years, it is THE BEST for "stuck" on materials - on cake pans, skillets, casseroles, etc. It is just the best...and I understand that they are no longer making it! What now???
Dawn Power Dissolver works great! Just spray it on a pan or the stovetop (for spill-overs)...wait a little while and wipe off the mess with a damp cloth. I love this stuff! No more scrubbing.
I bought this stuff on a suggestion from a friend of mine for something to clean the wheels on my motorcycle with. He claimed it was the best stuff around for taking off brake dust and whatever else gets picked up from the road. I believe him, and after using it, my wheels were the cleanest they'd ever been. It was a simple spray on, let sit, then wipe off with a damp rag. If it cleaned the crud off my wheels that easily, then it will certainly clean your dishes.
MAGNIFICENT PRODUCT, does exactly what it says it can do, reasonably priced yet way too hard to find!!! Buy in bulk if you run across it!!!
Have been using this for over 5 years. I have found it works best on a warm surface (especially old, burned on grease). I just warm the item with hot tap water. The only problem I have is how hard it is to find in the stores! I have searched in NJ, NY and Fla. Found it in 1 store each place BUT not always in stock. Worth searching for though.
HiI moved into a house recently and the previous owner left a bunch of cleaners behind including Dawn power dissolver. I put them in a box to recycle and forgot about them until my husband spilled axle grease on the garage floor. I found it while trying to figure out what to clean it with. My grandma always said dawn will take away grease so i tried it. I just sprayed it on and wiped it away the floor came out literally squeaky clean. Then my son left a crayon in his pocket and it melted all inside my drier. I tried the magic eraser and goo be gone with no results at all. I was just trying to get the goo be gone off with the dawn power dissolver but when I started rubbing it off it took the crayon right off too. I was able to wipe the rest of the dryer down with a cloth and the spray and it is super clean now. I haven't tried it on my stove or dishes yet but i will now. So happy it is still available!! A side note use gloves it is hard on the hands.
I just love this product. It gets off that black gunk on the bottom of pans and on the stovetop.
Used up my supply and have been searching stores everywhere. This product consistently delivers as promised. It is the best cleaner for pots and stove tops I have found.
I use this product on all my pots and pans and my stove. Relly gets off stubborn stains. and if you let the power dissolver sit for a bit you can actually see the grease coming off. Best product I have found to really work.
This product works great. I use it whenever I have baked on food, and it takes care of the problem without any scrubbing or any real elbow grease. Well worth the money, but can be hard to find.
This is a great product for laundry. I use it on a variety of stains, especially grease, grass, and anything else oil-based. It works great if you pretreat your clothing. It saves my kids clothes!
this Product work like magic .! Amazingit Just make my life I easier i use it for every thing
I used this product, and was really amazed. You just spray, leave it for a moment, and off the stuff comes! Great product.... Only problem.... Walmart doesn't carry enough of it... They only send a couple to our store at a time. I have to grab them all up or order them off there site. Oh, well, great product!!
You know that carbon stuff that gets on the bottom of your pans? I used to clean it with SOS pads, and wear down my knuckles. This Power Dissolver is like magic. Hard to believe how easy it is! Amazing. I wish the stores would carry more of it, I usually order on line, which is a bother.
I bought this product out of a discount bin at the corner store. I thought I might be able to use it for something. Turns out that I use it for almost everything. I mainly use this product to clean the hard water and rust stains out of my sink. This product is Amazing and use it in the kitchen, as well as other areas of the house.
My roommate had cooked and burned up 4 of my pans and skillets. I remember having the bottle in my laundry room so I used it. It was really incredible! I had burnt chunks of food that rinsed right off. I spent most of the day today looking for another bottle. It's worth a drive.
This was recommended by a friend who cooks a lot. Now I can't do without it. It makes pans with dried burnt crud come clean with ease. When I couldn't find it in my local store I had a friend mail me some. A must have for the serious cook.
This is the best ever!!! I have used this all over my kitchen and other areas in the house, it actually removed nicotine from my woodwork. I have used it on my ceiling fans too. Best product ever!!!!!
I've been using Dawn since 1979, and my Mom used it all the years I was growing up. Nothing else works as well to quickly clean just about anything!
Love dawn would'nt use anything eles
Really worth the money. Easily cuts grease. I use less of this than I do other products & it just works great. Worth every penny.
This is the ONLY dish soap I SWEAR by... refuse to use any other! Good deal, nice fragrance and cleans grease like no other...
Great product for the money spent!
I purchased this dishwashing liquid because not only does it smell wonderful, but your dishes come out sparkling clean! I got this in a larger bottle and refill my smaller bottle when needed. (I live alone, so don't have a lot of dishes at one time) This was at an excellent low price.
I love the grease cutting action of dawn. I purchased 2 of this large size so that we will not run out. My neice is teaching her 2 young boys on cleaning and making sure that it is clean and not smeared. especiallyy on the stove. They love the many suds but we are teaching them to only use a small amount.
I will be purchasing this item again and will recommend it also!
This was a good value. The only down fall was the shipping and handling cost.
It smells nice. Get tired of original. Original Dawn seems the best really.Wish it still had some phosphates in it.
Won't use anything else in our household! If it is good enough for my Mom it is good enough for me!
I've been looking for fragrance free softener sheets for a long time. Thesefit the bill!
This product is great because,it is scent free and works great
Bounce laundry fabric softener sheets are worth the money, the fabric sheets , makes my clothes smell nice, i will buy this product again
These dryer sheets leave a nice smell on my clothing and leave the clothes very soft.
I love the smell of this fresh gain scent. Do recommend! :)
I love this product. It does what it is supposed to do. I use it everyday and it gives my sheets a sweet, fresh smell! Spray bottle is pretty effective too. Highly recommend!
This smells so great that when my family gets home for the day. They all think I did laundry all day!
I spray Febreze on our furniture on our pillows and lightly on the carpet after vacuuming it gives the whole house a nice fresh scent that is not overpowering.,
Love the Febreze products. Excellent price.
This product did exactly what I purchased it for. We bought a couch that had been stored in a garage for several years. Great shape but a definite musty smell. One use of Febreze and the smell is gone. Also used it on some pillows from a smoky house and that worked too.
I have used another fabric softener for years but never felt that it left the clothes smelling fresh. A friend suggested that I give Downy a try so I did. I love its fragance but I just wish it lingered a wee bit longer in the clothes. They smell great coming out of the dryer but that doesn't last very long. Don't get me wrong. The clothes do not smell bad; they just don't have a lasting fresh smell unless one wears them immediately. Maybe I'm just being too picky.
This stuff leaves oily stains on clothing that won't come out.
I love this stuff I will never buy any other fabric softener it makes you clothes smell so good and it lasts for ever my washer and dryer is in my bathroom and my friends have asked me how I get my bathroom to smell so good lol all I have to do is do my laundry and the wonderful fresh smell lasts for a long time when I open my closet the smell is there so refreshing love love love that they started selling it in bigger bottles too excellent product.
I love this product! It leaves my clothes smelling fresh and clean for a long time after washing.
Mine works perfectly, I never have to miss the rinse cycle again.
I bought 4 of these...when the washer was done, two had water left inside, and 2 had DOWNY left inside. The 2 with Downy in them left marks on my clothes so I had to re-wash. Big disappointment as I don't have laundry in my apartment and was looking forward to less trips to the laundry room (downstairs and in a separate building).
I don't like using dryer sheets but had to do something because the static on my clothes is out of control. Having to remember to get the rinse cycle for liquid softener is a pain, so this really helps. I just bought mine & have run three loads with it, very happy. Wish it was cheaper or given away free with a bottle of softener or something.
Wonderful! I remember having one years ago. I know it will save on my water bill too. Got one for my daughter and she really likes it too.
This picture is the old, wonderful smelling Downy, but I received the new, not-wonderful, very strong smelling Downy. I do not recommend this new Downy. It looks similar, but it smells nothing like it. I wouldn't have given it even one star, but that's the lowest this program will let you go. I returned it, and I won't buy any Downy until the old scent comes back.
When I saw the picture of this Downy, I thought it was the old Downy. My favorite Downy. I've been trying to find it everywhere I can in hopes of having enough for the rest of my life. So far I have enough for 6 years. But when I got it, it was the "NEW Pearl" scent. I took each and every one of the 24 bottles I bought back to the store. This is the worst product ever and I can't even believe it's Downy. It just reeks. I could hardly stand to have it in my car for the hour it took me to get to my nearest Walmart.I sure hope the makers of Downy return to making the original scent because I know of NOBODY who can stand this new one and some people I know are jumping ship right now and buying Snuggle.
This is an awesome value. The price and size are unbelievable. People have to remember that this is a concentrated product and that you must use less to obtain the desired results. If you follow the recommended application, you will find that wonderful April Fresh scent that is long lasting. I love this product.
Downy left an icky residue on all my clothes. I used the minimum amount even for large loads and after removing the clothes from the dryer, I noticed a lot more lint in the lint trap than usual. I think the fabric softener broke down the material. I will not use this product again.
Great Price. Works wonderfullly. Would recommend to everyone who has problems finding Downy Ultra in rural areas.
This is the best fabric softener ever made. Not only does it smell AMAZING but it leaves your clothes soft. Only kind i use, it makes my house smell good the scent never leaves my clothes! I washed my kids summer clothes and packed them away for the winter and when i brought them back out they still smelled good =)
WOW! I never had doughts about this fabric softner made by Downy... The price is great and the value is incredible... I personally rather get the refill, so that I don't have to keep buying the bottles over and over... I strongly recommend it.
GREAT PRICE~~GREAT SIZESO WONDERFUL TO BE ABLE TO BUY ONLINE;COMES TO MY FRONT DOOR.
what more can I say, the title says it! Original april fresh scent!!!!
I have used this product for years and really like it. The fragance is great and makes clothes feel soft and smell good.
How can anyone rate this any less than 5 stars? Downy softener does what it says it will do and what I want it to do: a) it softens all my laundry; b) it removes any/all static cling; c) it leaves my laundry smelling lovely; d) it makes clothing much easier to iron; e) the fragrance lasts longer than other fabric softeners' fragrances (are there any others that even LEAVE a fragrance?). Because I get all ^ that every single time I use Downy, I realize it is a fabulous bargain. One cap full does the job each and every time; I'm never disappointed. THAT is all the reason anyone needs to achieve a 5 star rating, no?
In the economical downturn my daughter thought she could not afford Downey but missed its softness and delightful smell for her laundry so I bought it for her for Mothers Day. She loves it and has loved it all her life!!
i love this product it leaves my clothes smelling so good and clean its a comfort smell!!!
I have used this product for years and really like it. Have tried others but always come back to this.
I LOVE THE APPLE & CINNAMON IT MAKES MY WHOLE HOUSE SMELL GOOD IT WORKS THREW THE WHOLE HOUSE WHEN U WALK IN U SMELL IT RITE AWAY
i've purchased Glade products for years and i just have to say they are wonderful, Apple and cinnamon is one of my favorite scents by Glade is just perfect because is not too strong but neither is too light so is the perfect amount scent of fresh apples and spicy cinnamon in your house, you can adjust the amount of fragance in front of the unit and also is long lasting fragance ,so you don't have to worry about changing your refills constantly, is a great product, i also recomend Hawaiian breeze and vanilla breeze, thank you!
This is my absolute favorite Glade scent for my plug-ins. Puts a nice crisp, clean apple scent thru your home and lasts a while. Buying it here is better than the prices in any store, even with the shipping. Will continue to buy.
I tried this scent for the 1st time last month and I am on my way to Walmart to go buy more refills. I already have 3 plugins and I will buy 1 more. As soon as you walk in the door you can smell it. I LOVE IT!!!! I wish it was less expensive. I do not think it even last for 30 full days. That is my only complaint
I like the Glade fragrances and this is no exception. They are pricey but you get what you pay for.
I really like the crisp cool scent of the apple cinnamon. As with the others, my only 'complaint' is that the product is too pricey and doesn't last long enough considering the cost. Nevertheless, I will continue to purchase because it makes my house smell delicious.
Smells great, great Holiday scents
I ordered these with hope that the scent would filter throughout my home this past Christmas and it sure did...I regulated the dial for personal liking and everyone noticed, it was very popular! They both are still working and I still enjoy the yummy scent throughout my home!
I really enjoy this product and how well you can smell it throughout the room.
I love the Apple Cinnamon fragrance. Not too sweet and not too tart. Just right.
It makes my whole house smell good. I love to come home to a great smelling house.
I love glade plug-ins . I use them all year round . Plus, i love those new melt away candle wax that smells to for your candle warmers . It really makes my day to have a coupons for this product . So i can have my house smelling great and not costing me very much . Thanks for making our home smelling great.
Actually, I put this plug-in in the kitchen, but I could smell it thru the dining room and in the living room! That's not to say it's too strong! The scent was evenly distributed and not at all overwhelming. I believe I could love this scent all year long! :-)
I love the fragrance that apple cinn. plug-ins project in my house. I just wish they would last longer. Everyone that comes in my house says it smells so good I use these for living, kitchen, bath and bedroom areas. Problem is they cost so much with the number I use in my house. The Glade plug-ins and the apple cinn. fragrance is my favorite. I thought when the expensive packaging changed the price of this product would be lowered, however, it hasn't, so coupons are really appreciated to have my house smell it's best.With the plug-ins, it compasses the whole room so I can count on Glade plug-ins to do the job. Thank you.
It seems like it's christmas, I feel warm and tender. I, can hug myself.(LOL)
love it so much going to recommend it to all of my freinds
Really enjoy the scent.......
This candle was used in an open house and it sold! Best of all it was my house so now I get to start all over and experience more smells! Still thinking that Fresh Berries & Wild Raspberry will come out on top.
Love the scent. I wish it was easier to find in the stores.
The caps very hard to get off.I had 3 caps that broke of the sprayer.Had to through them away.Should be a better way to get it off.
We love the scents and the overall product, however our automatic sprayer thing just started to spray about once every two seconds! The room was overfilled with scent (way too strong) and the brand new can was empty in very short order! This can get VERY expensive, very quickly!
It must've shocked or scared my cat when it sprayed, and my cat has never tried to sleep up there again! I am so happy :) Now, my house smells fresh, and my cat is not climbing on the counter tops to get to the very top of the kitchen cabinets.
I just bought this product about a week ago and I am absolutely in love! I use it in my room and it keeps it smelling fresh all day. The clean linen scent is fantastic. I can't wait to try the other scents!
Refreshes the smell in the house, works great. It is a lovely scent to come to. The new Honeysuckle/Lavender is awesome.
this thing is awesome have a room that is large and can smell it everywhere
The scents are true to its fragrance and I have one in everyone room of my home.
I bought these at Sam's Club before the holidays, and I loved it. It seems to be the longest lasting investment of all the air scented products.
I bought this to use for the holidays and winter. I love Cinnamon and this spray has it.
I love the New Lavender & Peach Blossom. Terrific scent; I put it in my son's room and he liked it too. Hurray!
I am fragrance conscience at all times, friends always comment that each room of my home always smells so great. I try to buy a fragrance that fits with each room.My favorite though is the new Lavender & Peach Blossom for bathrooms and bedroom, it is very relaxing and even smells better than the old, Lavender and Vanilla. It is not overwhelming and I have taken advantage of getting the free wamers and using coupons in this price-driven age, let's face it why not buy economically for a great product?? Many compliments and referrals to friends,
I dont like the smell of the lavender & peach blossom at all . I have got a twin pack of it ! I hope my sister likes it .
Thank you GLADE for making this delightful and soothing smell of Lavendar and Peach Blossom!!!!
O My Gosh...I keep these in my bedroom and in the guest bedroom all of the time! Guests think they're stayng in a hotel....and Lavendar enhances good sleep..Another reason to have them in yur room.....
we have been buying Glade for many,many years it is the best I've ever had
The scent relaxes th dogs and they sleep deeper. The fragrance is EXCELLENT
I love this scent and it really covers the smoke and pet odors in our home. I just wish the oil lasted longer.
flowers and fruit sent mixet together, I love the sent, you will too!!!!
I have had my Glade Plug In Scented Warmer machine for over 2 years. I have to say I only use it when I have company, I use it in both of my bathrooms since I don't have windows live in an apartment. The Linen and Hawaiian scents fill the bathrooms, and guest don't have to fill uneasy. I have brought two refills and still have one left in the cabinet. I keep a cannister of Glade spray in the main bathroom at all times. Love Glade products they last a long time, and stay strong, do not loose their fragrance strength.
very unhappy with this product,I bought 7 warmers for myhome with little notice of scent change.
This is my favorite scent of glade...think island get away and all that.
Used to love these oil warmers, but now I'm looking for something to replace them. Very disappointing.
I'm very disappointed. I grew up having Glades products in my house, but I don't think I will be using the scented oils anymore.
cause it smells good, and is easy to use. Plug it in and forget it. LOL
love the scent
I recently purchased this thinking, oh man i hope this smells good! and boy was i right! it smells very pleasant and it's also a very relaxing/calming scent! if this is what you are looking for you've found it. A+++
I got this product because the previous people who live in my apartment had pets that went to the bathroom on the carpet i thought that maybe it would mask the odor. Well it did more then that after just 3 weeks of using it my house still was smelling great so my husband moved it from the room that smelt the worse in the beginning to our living room. after 2 more weeks the room that it was in still didn't smell bad I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO EVERYONE.
i love this product! Is about the only one i use in my place.
This product smells amazing! I have found that Glade really does make quality candles that last for up to 22 hours! I would definitely recommend this scent along with their 2-in-1 candles!
Smells soo yummy. And I bought it for my mom for christmas. I actually got her two. For the price you cant beat it.
This product brings my whole house to life with its rich sent of lavender and soft smell of vanilla. I just light one candle in the living room and you smell it through the whole house. I buy 2-3 a month. They are very relaxing and just perfect for me and my family.
I've never used a Hawaiian type of air freshener so this one took some getting used to but now I love the smell. I am very sensitive to smells but LOVE air fresheners, candles, etc. The device this refill is used for is by far my favorite automatic air freshener....this one lasted for 3 months in our downstairs bathroom which has lots of traffic between our family of four and guests.
Scent is nice but a little intense.
Good product, last for at least a month and room smells great
I didn't want over bearing scents but I do have animals in my home. It is amazing how well the clean linen works. When I come home from work, I walk into a clean smelling house. I can relax about people coming over and I have even been asked if I got rid of my pets. I never have to worry because clean linen warming oil is working for both my pets and I.
Now this is a product I expect from Glade. My twin plugins seem to last way beyond what's stated on the box. I love these and it not only emits noticeable scents, it somehow can cover a large area w/ the same great scent. These are a must-have.
Can't get over the smell. It smells so good. I ordered it for my mom for christmas and ordered two. The price was great. Just wish I found more scents.
It stinks badly don't buy it.......I don't know it smells like some nasty stuff ewwwwww
Smells Great !! Just wish they lasted longer... Smell good even if it's not lit!!!
I love glad candles I used another flavor and still will in winter but thehawaiian Breeze just has summer written all over it . It makes me think of things tropical or just beachy and i am a beach person.
My only complaint is that they are ALWAYS sold out in stores, and I've tried every store in my area that carries it...VERY frustrating. I've had to resort to removing one of the batteries from the one at work so it lasts longer... Luckily, I was able to find them online at Walmart.com, and at a cheaper price (YAY!)...I really hope they are not discontinued for some reason
This is one of the best smelling air freshener's, but very hard to find in any store!
I purchased this product after trying several different kinds of air fresheners, and I think this is the one that has won me over! Both of my roommates have one in each of their rooms, and every time I ever go into one of their rooms it always smells so good. I finally bought one for myself and my goodness it works like a charm. The alternating scents really keep things smelling nice and fresh and they never get old. One thing I really like about it is you can buy a set of 2 already paired up scents, or if you don't like those you can just get whichever two scents you want separately and make your own scent combo! I'd say the only real set-backs are that, yes, it does use up a tiny bit of electricity all day every day (and by a tiny bit, I mean a really, really tiny bit) and it is rather bulky. In this case however, the pros greatly outweigh the cons! I recommend this product to anyone looking to really add a nice touch to their home.
I use it in my room and when its on low you cant really smell it. I keep it on high and it works great. its been about month and its still working.
My house is very open and its hard to use the regular plugins in my home. When I saw these dual plugins i was so excited. They work excellent and the scent is very clean and not overwhelming. The only thing I didnt care for was they do not last 30 plus days.
I use the twin refills in my classroom with my glade fan, and I get compliments from everyone about how great my room smells! The scent doesn't quit working- you just get used to it after a while. The fans are great because they alternate the fragrance so you don't get used to it. (It switches back and forth every 20-30 minutes). This is by far my favorite fragrance combo!
The fragance stops working before it runs out. I guess the wick turns hard and stops absorving the oil.
I have an older home with very big rooms and tall ceilings. For years I have been searching for something that would freshen up my rooms. At one point I had 9 of the double sided oil warmers on the main level of the house and unless you stood right next to them you could not smell them at all. Last night I purchased two of the lasting impressions and turned them to high and my entire downstairs smells nice and fresh. I am off to the store today to buy a few more for the upstairs. I strongly recommend this product!!!!
I purchased this item from the store around Christmas time and it is Great. I use it in the basement and in the Living Room. The scent is Great and removes basement odors and in the Living area it circulates the scent throughout the house. This should be an all year around product instead of just seasonal.
This is such a great scent earthy scent that is not too flowery or smells like laundry soap! It's greatfor a guys apartment or man cave that really kills musty odors! I used this (and the one in green packaging with similar design) after cleaning up a foot of water in my cottage! Love IT....PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE keep it!!!
Wish Glade would figure out how popular this is and make enough to sell in stores. I'm just happy I found it online.
I just LOVE Glade Plug Ins!! They keep my house fresh and smelling good all the time! I keep one in every single room of my house! Am also glad Glade made Cashmere Woods a permanent scent now! It has a different kind of scent that I just love! I just love all the products from Glade - including the candles and sprays! Thank you Glade!!
I'm very please with this product, is my favorite of all and fits perfect in any room of any house,the aroma last until the last drop and is very soothing.the only problem is this scent is only seassonal so hurry up and try it, i'll bet you 'll like it too!
The first time I tried this scent I fell in love with it, however I was quite disappointed that it is not readily available. It seems to be only available in a hand full of stores. As a matter of fact, it seems like whenever I go to the store, I always find the same 4 fragrances. Apple cinnamon, Lavender, Hawaiian Breeze and Linen. Can you please, please make the other frangrances, Cashmere Woods, oh my I can't remember the names of my other fragrances more available. Thank you. By the way I love my Glade Automatic Sprayer.
I like the new packaging..it makes it easier to find in the store on the hanging racks...and the frangrance has been pleasing for all guests,...we like so many of the Glade scents, I have different ones in each room...Even my husband likes them, he is the one that keeps the batteries going and changes the containers. We have all the Glade products...Thank You Glade...
I love this scent, but I can't find it all the time in stores..
One of those real calming fragrances-------even my boyfriend likes it, and he doesn't like any of them!
i just swictched from hawiian breeze to cashmere woods.... i have visitors over and they always ask me the name of the scent
I have just discovered this fragrance and absolutely love it. When I went back to buy more it was difficult to find. Finally found the single refills and bought all 4 remaining on the shelf. I hope this fragrance isn't being discontinued as I have never had a fragrance I like better.
there is (almost) nothing worse than inhaling chemicals to make you sick to your stomach
Since discovering this scent, I am obsessed with seeking new products in every store I go into. I would love to see the scent in the carpet freshner and definately in the car form! Wonderful smell without smelling like an air freshner!
I love the smell of Cashmere woods .. it is a very nice soft and not over powering smell ..
Thank you for making long lasting fragrances :)
Great new scent. refreshing in all rooms except in kitchen, which I perfer baked apples. Can't stress enough the fragrance is AMAZING. How about making this carpet freshner
I love this scent. Please do not discontinue! I have had several compliments on the way my house smells with this product.
I love this fragrance. People that come to my home love this fragrance. I wish it came in carpet freshener.
After years of trying and trying to find my perfect scent I have Finally found it! I give it two thumbs up...its a scent that i can use all year round & I love that it smells like a cologne & not an air freshener! With a toddler running around things can get a bit stinky sometimes but I love how this is just an over powering smell.
I love this frangrance and have gotten so many compliments and questions about it. However, finding it is nearly impossible.
I love this scent. i wish it also came in the sence refill spray.
Glade Company, PLEASE PUT IT BACK ON THE SHELVES!!!!!
ITS A PRETTY ACCENT TO THE ROOM BUT THE CANISTERS ARE TINY AND THEY DO NOT EMIT MUCH OF ANY AMOUNT FOR FRAGRANCE WHEN DISPERSED.
I placed this in my main bathroom and love the scent each time I go in there. I am going to get several more for the rest of the house. Love it!
I like these products.
so i thought i'd change it up with this Lavender and Vanilla spray. [i use 'clean linen' all the time]. BIG mistake - this Lavender and Vanilla spray has a very acidic overtone, smells like cheap aftershave. I don't really even detect the lavender. or the vanilla. . i let it run for about a week in my great-room. Scent was VERY noticeable every time it sprayed. seems to give me a headache. [i don't have allergies]. Tossed it after two weeks, went back to 'clean linen'. i want my house to smell light and clean. not "overeager suitor".
This is one of the best smelling scents in this line and works with Airwick sprayers too!
I purchased four of these and put them through out the house. With animals it makes a great difference. I moved them around until I found the perfect spots so they wouldn't be to over bearing with any scent....Can't wait to try other scents, specially for the Holidays...
Wal-Mart did a great job packing (taping each ones cover,surrounding each can with puff pillows & speedy ship received the 2nd day after I place my order. Good Job !! Thank you
overall its a great and pleasant smell and it goes well throughout the different seasons all year long. I love to walk in a house or an office that has pleasant smells it helps the atmosphere feel good, you can feel the vibe,
Love the scent and the warmer itself. I use it in all the rooms along with my other units. French Vanilla is my favorite.
Smells just like french vanilla. Wish it lasted longer and wasn't so pricey but I still get it because it makes the house smell so good!
I have not been disappointed! This thing works like a charm. I wouldn't recommend putting in the bathroom though (like a previous reviewer stated) because the spray is concentrated therefore it's strong at first, much too strong for a small bathroom. I keep it on our mantle to freshen up the dining area and I plan on getting another one for the den. I like that you can just put it up and forget about it. You won't have to worry about a smelly house just in case you have unexpected guests. (plus, it came with batteries)
Just bought the starter kit- nice scent. However, I see it barely lasts 30 days. At the price of a refill- I won't be using it often. I like the new look as opposed to those white plastic holders. They give off a good spritz, good for hallways, closets--I use it in the entry way- but just not lasting. This scent has more of a "sweet" sense to it- if that helps.
I gave it a 3 star on Value due to the small amount the canister contains. It emptied after 2 months. Not bad though considering the traffic within our office. In a home, it probably will last a bit longer.
Other than the noise, unless you are triggering it to spray every 15 minutes you will not even notice the smell. So in my opinion it is not worth fooling with. I put mine in the donation box.
I like the fact that this sprays with movement and I do like the scent. But like another reviewer stated it can scare you pretty good. I set mine up and forgot to tell my husband about it and it totally freaked him out when he first walked by it. That being said- you do get used to it. It says the refill can last up to 30 days, but mine ran out after about 2 weeks with only 2 people in the house. Those refills are tiny!
Well i play football soccer lacrosse and also wrestle and after i throw all my equipment into my locker naturally it stinks i share a locker with my girlfriend who complained about this all the time this product helped a lot.
I bought this on sale and stocked up on them. Such a pretty scent! :) The fan that plugs in has low, med, or high setting. I keep it on low and when I expect guests, I higher it.
I can't say enough good things about this! :)
This item has a very pleasant smell and the price is right.
Great way to keep your room fresh!
I love how nice my House smells and this product last for a long time :)
I love glade plug-in products and have been purchasing them every month for many years now. I went to a Walmart that I normally do not visit, and they did not have any of the usual Glade plug-in scents that I usually buy. So, I decided to try the Red Honeysuckle Nectar scent. I placed my new plug-in scent oils in my warmer and in the middle of the night I awoke to an awful, sickening and pungent odor in my room. I thought that I was going to throw up because of this sickly odor. I opened up all of my windows and had to spray some Lysol to attempt to cover up this nasty odor. Of course I removed the oils from my warmer and bagged them up to return them back to the store at my usual Walmart to get a scent that is pleasant. I would not advise for anyone to use this particular scent!
I love this scent so much. I one in every single room in my home and in my office at work. I want to smell this scent everywhere that I go.
I just love this new fragrance! It's a clean smell, yet somewhat sweet. Because it is rather "bold", I keep the warmer on a lower setting and it last longer. I use it in my bathrooms, my home art studio and my bedroom. I just love it, for now anyway. Can't wait for more fragrances to try!!! I love your Plug-Ins and use them in every room in my home. Just love, love, love them all!Sincerely,LouKYMom
It gives my rooms a nice smell, when the mailman comes to deliver my mail he always ask me what makes my house smell so good? I like that :)
I hope more stores carry this, I really like it! I'm looking forward to buying the Fuji apple and Cardamom, as soon as I find it.
I have been impressed with this product because of how it works and how beautiful. People dont know that this is a duffuser, they think is only decor. Also, the smell is very strong and spreads through the room
This product, in Fuji Apple & Cardamom Spice, is a great addition to my bedroom. It gives a light apple scent that's a great fit for the fall, but isn't overwhelming or distracting. While the holder doesn't quite go with my decor, it fits well on a bookshelf, where it doesn't draw attention unless someone is looking for the source of the great smell.
When I first seen this product, I thought this will not work. But I was surpised when I inserted the diffusser and it started working The aroma was really good and I could smell it in my whole living room
I feel like Goldilocks from the three bears. The scent was just right. Not to overpowering and not to faint. It had just the right mix so that my senses were calmed and happy instead of insulted and overwhelmed. I would and have recommended this as "Just Right"
Every one I have given the coupons has really like the scents and how nice they look. They preferred not to plug in any device so this was very appreciated.I explained I was a bzzz agent and wanted their feedback, the were very happy with this product.
I normally use lavender candles in my bedroom so when I got the new Glade Expressions Oil Diffusers Lavender & Juniper berry I was excited to try it. I am sorry to say that I was very disappointed by the product. The scent was too strong with the juniper berry and not even close to enough lavender. The day after I set up the oil diffuser I came home from work and my house smelled like the cat litter I used to use when I had an indoor cat, not the scent I was expecting. Tracing the smell through the house I found the scent was coming from the oil diffuser. I could not smell the lavender at all, the juniper berry was way too strong.I normally love Glade products, but this a product that I will never purchase again.
I love this oil diffuser! The first frangrance I purchased was the Pineapple Mangosteen and it had a chemical rubber-like odor at times, but when I added the Fuji Apple & Cardomom Spice I got the full benefits. Now, when I walk in my house, I smell a sweet, clean welcoming fragrance that's not over powering. The holder is a bonus because it matches my decor perfectly.
After trying the Glade Expressions Cotton and Italian Mandarin Diffuser for a few weeks and not really noticing any aroma, I switched to the Lavender and Juniper Berry scent. This too was nice for maybe a day or so, but after that, NOTHING. Neither my husband or myself could notice any scent coming from the diffuser. We both even picked it up on different occasions to make sure there was still oil in there, which there was. For some reason, this product just doesnt work well. I would not recommend this to my family, friends or anyone that wants and needs a lasting scent. Its a shame.
The apple gives out more scent then the mango. Not too powering in smell which is good. It looks nice as a decoration as well!
I love the look and smell of the lavender. But I wish there were more scents to choose from. Such as Clean linen!
It's more of a fall scent but who says that youcan't enjoy a scent that resembles warm applecider with cinnamon sticks in it anytime of theyear. Sure is uplifting, welcomes fall.
Everytime I enter the room I ploaced it in, it lets out just a non-overpowering scent, and it just enhances the room.
I am very happy with the style and the fragrance of this Oil Diffuser. I have tried all three fragrances and it is hard to pick a favorite. I also like the fact that it is not formulated with phthalates. I only gave it four out of five stars because I wish the diffuser also came in the Cotton and Italian Mandarin fragrance. I think that would be an awesome fragrance for our laundry room.
I just purchased the Lavender and Vanilla oil air freshener. I usually buy the Hawaiian or Clean Linen scents. But this new one.....WOW!!! Makes my house smell just like my favorite hotel, THEhotel at Mandalay Bay in Las Vegas. I have bought Glad oil fresheners exclusively for years and have NEVER written to comment on them. This new scent, however, is worthy of this message Hopefully, it's a scent that will be around FOREVER. Love it!
My friend came over and was in love with the smell! I was afraid to try it being that I was ordering it online and have never tried it before but the combination of lavender and vanilla is great. I will definitely be ordering it again.
I dearly loved the Lavender fragrance by itself and do wish you would bring it back. I got compliments from friends and family on it. I cannot find just the lavender scent alone anymore and do wish you would bring it back.
This smells greattttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt
My Girls and I love this sent.It makes my home feel like it has just had an infusion of light. It also goes nicely in our Asian themed home. sweet but not too sweet, just right.
I like the white tea and lily because it has a LIGHT floral scent. Not heavy or overpowering. Wish this product wasn't so pricey and that it lasted longer.
I wanted to try airwick this pass week and I wish I didn't! I love Glade the scent last long, I love all the scents its more affordable...... I just love everything adout Glade!
When entering the room you can smell the fragrance and it stays throughout the day leaving a clean crisp smell. I LOVE IT!
Somewhat expensive, but works well in small spaces like a bathroom.
I love the scents they smell wonderful. It's so nice to have a little spray set for how often you wish. I just wish they would go on sale. You don't need a despenser to use them. You can spray as usual.
This is such a delightful scented spray so glad I bought two thy are always out of stock online.
This is the first I've used the febreze kind. I prefer the tide with color safe bleach personally. This was good since the store didn't have anything else. I will say that the smell lasts and lasts. I used this on a couple blankets and they still smell just as fresh and strong as the day I washed them which was a couple weeks ago now. Pretty nice!
i like this product, but smells bad.
I've always used Tide and its easier with the big jug and not as expense as other at dosen't do what Tide does and home delievery makes thing very good
I must say buying this detergent definitely saved me some money and I don't have to buy detergent for the next two months! I will always buy my detergent from this website.
I think it's the best detergent I've ever used w/ the Febreeze in it (and April fresh Downy, lol) EVERYONE loves how my clothes & bedding smell.
Great value and it's been working for me for years, never disappoints me :)
My son like's to wash with tide so do I that's all that I use at home !!!
I thought I'd splurge and buy some Tide. I do a lot of laundry and since Tide is the most expensive on the market, I don't buy it often. I was very disappointed in the results. Not sure if I'm allowed to say this, but Era Plus works so much better at getting stains out. No, don't work for Era (whoever makes it?) I just know my laundry.
It smells really good (being that I am a lady), but I don't know that I'd want my man smelling like this. Leaves it soft and fresh for days though.
Very little needs 2 be used 2 get your clothes clean. The scent of febreze still linger after a wash. Works wonders on my husbands socks.
Me and my boyfreind both used this detergent because it smells so great! Unfortunately on 2 separate occasions, in 2 different washing machines, it turned the armpits of our white T-shirts different colors! His turned Red, and mine Black. I do not recommend washing anything white with this detergent.
I was double-washing my laundry because the overwhelming, chemical-smelling odor was so bad. I finally realized it was the Febreze Freshness odor of the Tide laundry detergent that was causing the problem. I would highly recommend that Tide discontinue this fragrance.
Tide plus Febreze Freshness Liquid Laundry Detergent works great. Make my whole house smell GREAT and keeps my clothes smelling great even if I dont wear it for over a week!!!! excellent PRODUCT!!
Not sure how others are getting good results from this product, unless top loaders are getting different result!
I've used Tide for years and appreciate the job it does. I also use the Cold Water Tide for colors and like it as well. The only request I have is to PLEASE consider bringing back the White Lilac scent. It was so soothing and fresh. Company always commented on how good their towels and sheets smelled, even after months in the cupboard.
I absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE Tide with Febreeze!!!! I have washed all my couch cushions in it, my childrens bedding and ALL of our clothes!!! I love the freshness of the smell!!! Thank you for a great product :)
I always buy TIDE and have never complained but I just bought the Febreze Tide because I thought I would enjoy a fresh clean smell but after pulling the clothes out of the dryer there was an overwhelming odor of mildew and after several loads which continued to smell of mildew and dirty feet...I refuse to use it again. I will not recommend to anyone and suggest STRONGLY that you either discontinue the Febreze Tide or find a way to fix it.
I purchased the product to try it. I did 3 loads of laundry. I have rewashed all of the clothes with my normal product. The scent is overwhelming. It is so strong, it overpowers anything else. The worst part is that the scent isn't pleasant. I thought if it were to be strong, it would be a strong floral scent. I can't describe the scent that stays on the clothes. It is as if the soap didn't rinse off.I rewashed all of my clothes and will stick with my original product. At least I tried it! I won't be recommending it to any of my friends.
i was holding my granddaugther that is a year old and she kept smelling my shirt and she would just say aaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh smell again and same thing aaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhh it was so cute but she noticed the great smell i just love tide plus febreze
I love this product! My clothes smells great even after you are wearing them all day.Your clothes come out clean and refreshed.
I love this product. It makes my clothes so clean and smelling fresh.
I have a family of 6 people and we are on a military budget, however I always make sure to put Tide in my budget. I have been using Tide products for 14yrs now and it is the only product that I will use to wash and dry my family clothes with. It gives a freshness and softness to the clothes that cannot be compared to other product. I would like to thank you all for this products and tell you all to keep up the good work.
Love the smell of the Tide with Febreze detergent. I always use it to wash my husband's workout cloths They continue to smell great days later. I use the Tide with Bleach for our day to day cloths and the Tide Free and Clear for sheets and towels. I am a multiple Tide lover! Keep up the good work
Recently I have become a new mother and even though I love this product it has become out of the budget even with the dollar off coupon. I miss my clothes smelling that wonder clean smell. If the cost of the item went down or if I could get better coupons the Tide plus Febreze would be in my laundry room all the time!
I love the smeal, Of Tide with Febreze Sport.But mi color's look terrible, after I used.
I have an 8 year old who plays soccer and it has been particularly rainy lately. His soccer field was a complete swamp and they played anyway. When he got off the field, my husband undressed him at the car and threw his muddy clothes in the trunk. When I got home and went to wash them, I just groaned thinking they would never come clean. One wash later, you cannot even tell they had been soaked in mud...not one spot or stain remained! I wish there was a place to post the before and after pictures!! I am so completely impressed with this Tide...oh and it smells great (spring & renewal)!
This is by far the best scent. Please make it in the larger size and HE.
I have been using tide for as long as I can remember. I love tide and it just got better with Fabreze in it!
We picked up the Tide with Febreze this week! We love it! What a wonderful combination: Tide & Febreze!!! Thank you for this option! And thank you for the kindness that you've shown to disaster victims by sponsoring the Tide LOADS OF HOPE! We're honored to use products that in turn help others!Sincerely,The Potter Family
I have been using tide products for years, and generally, have been pleased. I must comment on the very strange, lingering smell of tide he with febreeze laundry detergent. My best description would be that of cat urine, and yes, I know how that smells, being a cat owner. the smell lingers.It smells our closet and even overwhelms colognes, I am embarrassed to wear these clothes, and am going to have to rewash them. Even my husband,who doesnt even know when I cut 4 inches of hair or move furniture around, noticed and complained, as did our twelve year old daughter. I have two large bottles of this stuff and wont be using it. Is there anyway to get my money back?
My husband's job requires that he remain standing all day while running around managing an entire market. When he gets home, I can smell his feet as if he just hit me across the face with his socks, but with Tide with Febreeze in it sucks away the nasty smell of his socks and leaves a gentle fresh scent which allows my stomach to stop churning! I'm a Tide-and-true fan of Tide!!!
I love febreeze and use it faithfully everyday and now you put my favorite scent of febreeze in my laundry detergent and I LOVE IT. Tide is the ONLY detergent I use and will EVER use. :)Thanks for putting my 2 favorite items together in ONE :)
I have never loved a product as much as Tide Febreze. I have a dog that sleeps with me every night and I washed my comforter with this product and even after 2 weeks since the comforter has been washed I wake up every morning and say, "I can't believe this comforter still smells this GREAT!!!"Also, I workout every day and my clothes were getting to the point where they just never smelled clean after washing them. After using Tide Febreze it is AMAZING how fresh they smell.This is the best detergent ever!!!!
i use to use tide mountain fresh but now the tide with febreze in it is wounderful. I love it. I work out and i do not want to wash such a small load, with tide with febreze i can wait another day. Thanks Tide you will be the only one brought into my house
Where have you been all of my life? I am in love!....I bought Tide w/febreze and I love it! I can wear a top that I washed two weeks ago and still smell the fresh scent. I love it!. Never consider discontinuing this product!
I have grew up seeing my mother using Tide and have continued to use it in my adult years. Your clothes smell so fresh and when you open the drawers or closet, it is like you just took them out of the dryer. My only thing is that I fell in love with Tide with Febreze scent Meadows and Rain. I guess they took it off the market but Spring Renewal is a great substitute. I wouldn't change detergents for anything. Thank you the many years of freshness.
I usually stay away from trying new detergents because of sensitive skin issues in our family, but bought Tide Spring Renewal when my store was out of the original Tide detergent. That was a couple months ago and I won't buy anything else now. Everytime my husband does his laundry he comments about how much he loves the smell of this and he is an auto body mechanic and has commented how he loves that he can still smell the fresh scent in his clothes at the end of his work day. For him to gush about a laundry detergent the way he has...it must be good! Tide - NEVER change or discontinue this formula...it is PERFECT!
I am a fanatic when it comes to my laundry! It has to be clean(obviously), and it has to smell wicked good. I used to take forever in the store picking out a detergent. I had to make sure it smelled just perfect. Well, a little FYI...Tide w/Febreze Freshness Spring & Renewal is awesome! One use and I was hooked. I love this stuff. The only thing is that I really want to buy a bigger bottle. I have been to every local retailer within 30 miles and can't find it in the bigger bottle(see, told you I love it). Do they even offer it in that size? I hope that this particular scent for HE machines never gets discontinued!! Please keep it forever. One bad thing I have to say is, the Tide w/Febreze Sport scent smelled horrible!! I will never buy that particular scent again. It was just gross.
This is the best smelling detergent I've ever used! Please keep it on the market forever!
OK, I have been complaining lately on this website about the scent of liquid Tide original scent since the Acti Lift was added to the formula. That scent is bitter and horrible. I have spent a lot of money trying other Tide scents and have not liked any of them until I tried Tide plus Frebreze Seaside Fresh. I love this smell.I tried the Tide plus Febreze Spring & Renewel and did not like that one at all. It smelled like bubble gum. I kept trying different Tide scents since Tide is the best detergent on the market. It's a shame they ruined the other scents with the Acti Lift , but the Seaside Fresh smells wonderful. Please don't change this one. I wish it came in bigger bottles to make it more cost effective and was available in more stores. I can only find it in one store in my area.For the record, I am not one to write reviews on any product, but I felt compelled to voice my opinion about Tide.
I had not been a fan of tide scents until I tried the tide plus febreze seaside fresh. It is truly my favorite detergent. My clothes smell soooo fresh, and the scent lasts all day. LOVE this product.
Love this product; closet smells wonderful, enjoy ironing clothes again. Hope they keep it available for ever.
I bought HE Tide Sport and I love it! It makes my laundry smell great. I've tried all sorts of other HE detergents, but have not found any that compete with Tide.
I am a mom of two daughters, ages 8 and 2. My daughters and I LOVE the smell/scent of Tide plus Febreze, and Tide SPORT! Every week we strip the bed linens to wash them. After re-making their beds with their clean sheets and blankets washed in Tide plus Febreze, they can't wait to snuggle up under the covers, its nearly impossible to to keep them out of bed long enough to finish making it! Thank you tide for the Wonderful product. I think that, as my girls get older, and use this in their homes, it will bring back great memories of their childhood!
I received a free sample of the Sport variety a while back. Being the poor (ahem, frugal) college student I am, I've been using whatever has been on sale at the store. When I found my little sample again, I decided to give it a go. I didn't really notice anything special at first- my clothes don't typically get really dirty or stained- but when I put on my pjs, I really noticed the scent in my t-shirt. It's amazing! And my clothes are still smelling fresh today. I will definitely be purchasing Tide with Febreze from now on :)
My family loves the Tide with the lavendar scent, or as we call it, "Tide with the purple cap". We wouldn't use anything else. One time wea friend recommended a brand that was a couple dollars cheaper. She said it worked just as well as Tide, so I tried it to see. IT WASN'T EVEN CLOSE! My husband noticed the minute his clothes came out of the dryer. The scent wasn't the only thing that was wrong. His clothes still had stains on them. He's a forest ranger and he can get clothes pretty dirty. Tide gets it out the first time, every time. Besides its strength, the scent keeps the bedroom linens smelling nice all week. I gave my bargain brand to the person who recommended it and got my Tide back. We won't ever go back to anything else!
This product costs a bit more but is well worth the price. With a house full of athletic teenagers, it makes my job much more doable.
With a husband who works construction and 2 teenage daughters active in sports, it was hard to find a product that would not only get out dirt but also odors. Once we tried Tide plus Febreze SPORT with the Active Fresh Scent we were hooked. It does cost a little bit more but is so worth it!! I truly believe this is the best product out there right now!! I would (and have) highly recommend it!
My husband operates a poultry farm. I was using bleach on all his clothes just to remove the odor from his clothes. Then I tried Tide with Febreze and it Works Great! no more using bleach to help with the odors, just the Tide works wonderfully.Thanks Tide!!
My husband recently purchased this product - HE Sport with Febreze (black cap). After a couple of loads of laundry, our clothes started to smell terrible. I thought that perhaps our front loading machine had retained some mold from washing towels. No such luck. After cleaning with Affresh, Borax, Vinegar, the smell remained. I noticed while doing hot yoga, what I thought to be body odor! I was embarassed as I never thought it could be the detergent. I couldn't take it anymore since now our towels and bed linens were stinking too. I went back to our old Tide HE and the smell disappeared. I don't usually write reviews good or bad, but thought it imperative that somebody know how bad this stuff smells. Be glad you can't find it in the store. You aren't missing anything.
I grew up always using Tide only. It was versatile enough to use in the laundry, cleaning the floors and washing dishes. This new product with Febreze is unbeatable. Caring for an elderly parent, with occasional accidents, this product is a Godsend. Not even a hint of a problem after it's laundered. Anyone with children, pets or anyone who is subject to accidents should use this.
My husband just started working at a company that treats railroad ties, so he comes home smelling like creosote (yuck!). Tide Sport takes the odors away!
Since we have been using Tide my husband actually told me the clothes are getting cleaner, so no more CHEAP detergents for me,The freshness and smell are vedry pleasurable.Thaks again TIDE
Love the way this detergent smells, and it has great cleaning power. The fragrance actually spreads in the area my washer/dryer is, so it's like getting a little air freshener as well!
I normally buy cheap laundry detergent. Since we move to a house, I start using tide HE liquid detergent. I totally loved it! I use only the measurement on the bottle cap. it still amaze me with that little amount of detergent can clean the entire load of clothes. We have baby and his "like mustard stain" waste can't get off easily just by regular washing. I wash the clothes with other detergent by hand and I still see the stain. When I put on the laundry machine using tide, everything come clean like new!The funny things is when we purchase the house, it has some kind of nice smell. we asked the seller what kind of air freshener he used. Nothing. he never used any kind of air freshener. We just finally realized that the smell must come from this detergent... what a nice addition...
I've read hundreds of product reviews for various items but have never written one. After using this product, I was obligated to write my first one. I switched to this product from a leading competitor that I have been using for years after a recent visit to a friend's house. My friend's linens smelled so clean and wonderful -- she said she used Tide. I bought this product and have been thoroughly pleased with the fresh fragrance it gives my clothes. Not only does this product make my clothes smell heavenly, but it has restored the whiteness of my husband's t-shirts. I haven't seen his shirts look so white since the day they came out of the package! Awesome product! Job well done, Tide!!
As a female, city letter carrier, it is important to stay "so fresh and so clean clean". Thanks Tide for keeping me clean and smelling like a Lady.
Bought this to try on my husbands work clothes, he's in maintenance, and in the summer especially, they can really stink. First time I used it, he said his clothes smelled like bubble gum, and he never wanted to use anything else again. He started recommending it to everyone he worked with, made his buddies sniff his clothes, it was hilarious. It's the only thing we use now. Love the scent, love the product!
I LOVE THE SCENT OF THE TIDE WITH FEBREEZE. THE SPRING RENEWAL KIND WAS THE BEST ONE. I JUST LOVE THE WAY IT MADE MY CLOTHES SMELL. AWESOME PRODUCT!!!!!!
A great whitening product, smells good and better than any other version of Tide.
I usually buy Tide plus a touch of Downey and have been very satisfied. Recently I decided to try the Tide febreze SPORT(100 oz.). I am very disappointed in this purchase. I bought it to wash gym clothes for a fresher smell. I've used it twice and my clothes actually stink....they smell worse than before I washed them. I will continue to buy my usual Tide but never the SPORT again.
This is my favorite detergent for washing my family's clothes. Everyone is satisfied and I love having towels that smell good. Somehow, it starts the day nicely!
I just love the smell of the Seaside Fresh detergent... I use it every time I wash laundry!! It makes my clothes smell so good, with some other laundry detergents your clothes don't smell good after being washed.. With this detergent my clothes smell good even after being dried... I've used numerous brands of laundry detergent, this one is the best one I've found... I would recommend this product to anyone!!!
I also love the Febreze SPORT and was disappointed when I purchased a new HE machine that I was not able to use the SPORT scent for the HE.
TIDE he with Febreeze Sport is now my FAVORITE laundry detergent! I was a GAIN user for years, and have been converted! I'm not super crazy about the higher price, but it's worth it since I only have to wash those stinky clothes ONCE and not repeatedly to get the stink out!With a grubby hubby, a stinky teen and potty pants little ones, TIDE sport gets ALL the odors out with just one wash!I really miss their Deep Clean fragrance (that peppery smell was my favorite) and would love it if you could bring it back!Thanks TIDE, for your wonderful product!
TIDE he with Febreeze Sport is my FAVORITE laundry detergent!!! Love how fresh the clothes smell. It is finally available at the super store I shop at, only wish they carried a larger size--the biggest!
My son works in a restaurant. After trying MANY laundry products to remove that horrible "restaurant" smell from his work clothes, I purchased Tide with Febreze. The results are everything I hoped for. His clothes smell FRESH. A co-worker even commented, "You smell good."Thank you for developing this product. I LOVE IT!
I love Febreeze Sport. Now I own an HE washer. Febreeze Sport does not come in HE form.P&G : Please help!
I have been an avid Gain user for years until I tried Tide with Febreze....it gets rid of all types of smells. I have a teenager who plays alot of sports, and sometimes his sweaty clothes stay in his locker at school for days--they are disgusting!!! This is the only detergent I have found that removes ALL of the odor (no matter how putrid) the FIRST time. I have told everyone about this product. Thank you for Tide w/ Febreze!!!!!! :)
I love using Tide but have trouble finding HE in the powder. My grandmother used Tide, my mother used Tide and I've used for as long as I've washed clothes.
I have been using Gain for years and decided to buy Tide with Fabreze.... the smell is absolutely awesome and washing clothes with it is a pleasure.... I found something amazing which furthers my belief that Tide is the best, even clothes I washed in Gain smells of the Tide, just from hanging beside the Tide washed clothes in my closet.... the Tide spring & renewal is awesome....
After a few months of waiting, last week I found the seaside fresh at my grocery store I was so happy. When I washed my clothes with it they smelled terrific. I am so pleased with all three products in the Tide febreze collection and will buy these three Tide products most of the time. Tide is the best and I will continue to remain a faithful Tide customer. Keep up the good work Tide.
Okay, I used another liquid detergent with Febreze in it, and it worked all right. I got a sample in the mail so I tried Tide with Febreze because I wanted that smell of freshness and I was skeptical, but now Tide with Febreze Freshness Liquid is the ONLY liquid detergent I have bought in the last year. Not only does it deliver a clean smelling freshness, it cleans my clothes without fading or leaving spotting on them, and now they have the new Acti-lift, which gives me even more reason to use Tide! Tide is keeping me and my clothes happy, and to use something else is unthinkable.
I absolutely LOVE this new Tide with Fabreeze. Even my house smells good when they are in the dryer. And the sheets after washing them in Tide, it keeps smelling great days after I wash them. My husband is in construction, so you know he gets dirty. This new Tide gets them clean and he smells so nice, I have teased him that all the other fellas on the construction sight will notice how nice he smells. I dont think I would ever use anything ever again after using this product. I am completely sold. I love it, keep up the good work Tide.
I have always been a Tide user and will continue to do so but I can't stand the smell of the Spring & Renewal Tide. It stinks up my laundry room every time I use it and stays that way the whole day. It almost smells like dirty socks to me. Yuck!
I use Febreze Freshness to help clean my daughter's volleyball clothes. Sometimes they really could use something strong to penetrate all of the perspiration odor. So, I am happy to know about 'Tide Plus Febreze." It has truly been a life saver! Thanks.
Have tried every product available and nothing could get the smell completely out of my husband's workout clothes. This product does!!! Love it!
I love the smell of my freshly cleaned clothes and how they look. They are bright and fresh looking. I love tide products and have a been a loyal user for many years.
i've used Tide for so many years simply because it has always been the best available! bar none!
I love the clean fresh scent that Febreze leaves in my clean clothes. My grandmother, my mother, myself and my child are all tide users. We are a 4th generation tide family. I NEVER USE ANYTHING ELSE! LOVE IT
Love this product, but would like to have new scents like my favorite - Lavender Vanilla Comfort!
Who new that when I got married I would really be married to the washing machine? Because of Tide with Fabreeze that's 1 affair my husband is happy about. Using Tide with Fabreeze makes not only makes everything I wash smell like it was line dried in the fresh air(which we don't have much of in Brentwood- (I live 2 blocks from a White Castle), But it makes doing laundry a BREEZE. Using Tide I never have to worry about my laundry coming out clean but now I even stopped using fabric softener. I don't use my drier for much because I don't believe in frying to a crisp. Using Tide with Fabreeze I can smell the freshness as soon as I open the washing machine. Even my husband noticed when I had clothes drying on hangers he said,"what smells so good, did you get a new candle(only burn fabreeze)?" I told him, "no babe that's the laundry on the hangers in the bathroom." It literally permeates the whole 2800sqft house we have. We love it. I love how Tide cleans my laundry & adding Fabreeze to it makes everything smell better than ever. It was funny when I had asked him if his sweat shirt needed to be washed, he smelled it & said yea it doesn't smell like Fabreeze anymore. I used to have to wait til he wasn't looking or sleeping to wash his favorite sweats, shorts, hat etc. Now he hands them over willingly because they don't have that fabreeze freshness anymore as he puts it. In my opinion Tide made the clothes smell fresh & clean anyway, but by adding Fabreeze to it the product got better. Thank you for saving me time(no more fabric softener) & for making my life easier by not having to cop my husbands favorite things to wash them. Because I don't use the drier & I hang most everything on hangers to dry I am also freshening up my house @ the sametime- everytime I do laundry (which is constantly).Thanks again to Tide & P&G for taking a great product & making it even better. There's somethng to be said for being brand& product loyal. My only complaint is the pricing- it is kind of on the high side. But I guess like the saying goes, "you get what you pay for."Right? As far as cleanliness & freshness I don't have any complaints what so ever. I couldn't ask for a better product.
I must be honest and upfront I bought this item at first because I buy almost all Febreze Products. I'd never used Tide before but man was I amazed. Not only do my clothes come out clean and keep their color well, they smell fantastic! It is a strong scent the Tide smell mixed with Febreze so you really have to like it but I love it! If I could I'd marry this product. Sometimes I'll wash things that are clean just to smell the wonderful scent! What a great feeling crawling into bed of clean sheets with a heavenly smell.... puts me right to sleep!I think it goes without mentioning that I'd recommend this product to a friend.
Having washed clothes, using Tide products, for a huge family for years, I can honestly say "Tide" has helped me to have the cleanest appearing and nicest smelling clothes ever for my family. It made washing piles of laundry not an unpleasant chore.
Gets better with each load! I have used Tide all my life and it just gets better and better!
i have used both the tide w/bleach as well as the tide w/frebreze. I also used the new liquid tide,(I don't recall the exact name-its an all-inclusive" type. I found all the 3 tide products, as well as the tide booster powder product= to all be the best laundry detergents I have ever used. Stains,-even old stains-(I did pre-treat them-using the tide battery revolving stain brush dipped in liquid tide and then into the powder-tide w/bleach! ), all came out. the whites were whiter than i'ld seen in years. I am now a tide advocate and then some!
I always get complements on how fresh my clothes smell.
This product is fabulous, I even found my Husband using it, it smells so Good and Cleans Great. I won't use anything else.
I really have a hard time just finding anytide in He I would love to find it with Febreeze
I LOVE Tide plus Febreze! My clothes, linen, bedsheets, towels, etc keep that fresh scent for several days. I catch myself smelling my clothes and thinking, "Wow, this product works well!" Thanks for making a wonderful product!!!
other products you buy tou have to use twice the usual amount and it can not beat the performance of tid so why save less to pay more that is bassicaly what you are doing the tide will go 3 times longer then those cheaper brands it gives the freshness that is out of this world that lastest for days and days and the cleaning performance to me you can not beat i have used several different brands and they cannot add up to the value of tide my rating would have to be 10 on the tide
I have always loved Tide products. This is great. It just gets better and better. It smells great and it really get the job done.
Ever since I started using Tide with Febreze; my husband's work clothes have not had any oil, dirt, etc. odors. His clothes smell fresh and clean. I only use this product because it definitely works. I have told a lot of my friends and relatives, and even people in stores if they are by the soap products. They seem to trust my judgement.
I had my dogs out in the country and they cornered a skunk. Unfortunately I was downwind and ended up skunked too. Before I threw out my clothes I tried washing them in Tide with Fabreze. After one wash the smell, and it was some smell, was gone. I can't think of a better testimonial.
I always use Tide for laundry, but the smell of the Tide plus Febreze Freshness. is overwhelming. If you exercise and sweat while wearing these clothes the smell will gag you. I have had to dilute this detergent to use it.
Tide has alway been a Liquid Laundry Deterget I trust to clean my family's cloth and now Febreze added our cloth will smell Freeher.
I am a busy mom of 4 and am going to nursing school. Let me tell you, I am not the most attentive to stains right now. This leaves our clothes smelling great and it gets thoses unknown stains out. Love It !
I am in LOVE with Tide's Spring & Renewal Detergent and Softner! It is the only detergent that I will use.... I get tons of compliments on the way that my clothes smell! Try it out! :)
I have tried other sports detergents that promise to remove that post-workout odor only to be disappointed. This product works so well that even after 75 minutes of cardio, a yoga class, and some weight-training, my clothes still smell great.
My daughter and I are both very particular about the scents we use. We'll spend 20 minutes trying out different things to find a good one. This one is very good. Our only complaint is that we have an HE washer and we have trouble finding this scent in stock in the HE on a regular basis. Wish we could count on finding it more often.
I love Tide with Febreeze for HE machines, but would love to see the sport version in HE. I guess it hasn't come out yet?
THERE IS NOTHING BETTER THAN TIDE NO MATTER WHAT THEY ADD TO IT.
My daughters house caught fire and sustained heavy smoke damage. Tide with Febreze and a stain booster took the awful smell out of her clothes in one wash.
I have used tide for years, And I just simply love all of the products. And it leaves my clothes smelling great.
I have used Tide with fabreeze for a couple of years now. I have recommended it to my friends. (who by the way switched). I love the smell and it makes everything smell clean. When I get into bed or snuggle with a blanket it adds cozyness as well. LOVE IT!!!
Please ! If you do ANYthing with this,do something about the god awful stink of the liquid Tide ! It`s horrible,and everyone agrees
Its so nice to take clothes out of the drawer and have that fresh smell that seems to last all day.
I love the Tide with Febreze. All my laundry comes out fresh and clean. Everything has a wonderful scent. I have had my HE washer for over 8 years. At the time of purchase it was very difficult to find HE detergents. Tide has always been my favorite, and I am very happy to see more HE Tide Detergent's now available. If possible please make a larger size Tide/Febreze /HE. The 26 load doesn't last very long in our houshold. Excellent Product if you like keeping your clothes looking nice! Thank You for the HE availability!
I absolutely love this particular scent and it is so hard to find. I think it smells better than any of the others. Please don't tell me that they are going to not make it any more. Pleaseeeeeeee!
Im already using your products. But after seeing the Venus Williams spot on TV you have customer for life. I will be buying the Febreze Tide next time I shop. I also love how well the stain removing tablets work keep up the great work.
I have used almost everyone of Tide's laundry products and I am sold.......My Mother used Tide and I won't use anything else, my children use it too. It makes my laundry smell clean and fresh, everytime.
It's like having an 'old fashioned' sachet in my dresser drawers, everything smells fresh for a long time.
What an awesome product! I LOVE IT!! My clothes smell like they just were washed everyday!! My clothes feel clean with out feeling greasy like a softener can make them feel. Thanks Tide for making the best detergent out there!
I recently purchased 2Xultra Tide with Febreze (Meadows & Rain). Love the product, BUT before I could use the product, I could NOT get the lid off!! My husband tried without success! I had to bang the cap on the counter, then my husband got it off, with much effort! How would someone with poor grip or an elderly person get the lid off? This might affect whether I would buy the product again, even though I love the product! The numbers stamped on the lid are: 934317, then under that is 020616. Thank you for listening!
I have had the task of writing your company a letter, concerning container size of Tide HE. The bottle was too tall to fit in my LG pedestal storage beneath my high efficiency washer. I had to place the bottle of Tide HE on it's side, making a mess every time I poured it out. I found this odd since this specific brand of Tide was made for such machines.After purchasing a new bottle of Tide HE, I was happy to see that the size of the bottle has changed and now fits beneath my washer. You have saved me a letter ... except this one to thank you! Thanks so much for accommodating us HE machine, pedestal users. It's the little things that make my day brighter! :)
I grew up with my mom using Tide and the scent always reminded me of childhood and home.I began using Febreze in my husband's loads of uniforms as soon as it was on the market.To now have both available in one liquid is time and money saving.My husband has passed away but washing my clothes and bedding in Tide with Febreze makes it seem he is hugging me all the time!
I love this stuff! Unlike so many other scented laundry cleaners or fabric softeners, this stuff really does last! There is nothing better than feeling like your inside of a commercial, picking up your favorite sweater and having it smell wonderful *days* after you last washed it! Keep up the good work, Tide!
very watery, not like other products for HE machines. Will not purchase again.
I am allergic to all brands of laundry detergent.... EXCEPT Tide. I'm so glad they have this scent. I don't have to use softner or anything because my clothes come out smelling awesome everytime. I found the larger size (52 loads) once and I can't remember where, so now I'm stuck getting the 26 loads bottle. I wish I remembered where!!!!!
I am very sensitive to perfumes but this scent is fabulous! Having the febreze in the soap is a great idea.
I love Tide with Lavender but with Febreze it smells like medicine! Take the Febreze out and just make it with Lavender scent.Won't buy this again sorry
I have well water at my house. Our water tends to go through cycles when it comes to the smell of it. If I do the laundry during one of the "smelly" times, I can tell you that NOTHING can make my laundry smell good EXCEPT Tide with Febreze! I get comments on how good it smells when I use it! I don't buy anything else!
I LOVE this product.. I try to do a load of laundry a day just so I can smell it! I dont know what I would do if you ever stopped selling it! LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!!!!!!
I had used other detergents for years and added frebreeze to my laundry, but when Tide with Frebreeze came out all that changed. I have been using Tide with Frebreeze since it's release and we have always had people tell us how clean and fresh our clothes (including my oldest son's sweaty gym clothes) smell when we first arrive somewhere. We have friends remark that items washed in your detergent smell like they just come out of the dryer, I haven't the heart to tell them they were wash in some cases weeks ago. No matter where I work on my sales route and what kinds of smells get embedded in my clothes(smoke mostly), I know one wash with Tide with Frebreeze will get it out and make everything smell fresh for a long time.Thanks for make fresh clean laundry easy to achieve.
I started using this product a little over a year ago. And I've been hooked ever since! I'm not picky on which scent and this is another one that works well in cold water as well.
i love the way tide febreze smell it just makes you feel good all over and the way the world is now that is a poisitive thing.
I think this is causing issues with my LG Tromm washers, too many suds.
I simply love this detergent! It cleans my clothes and leaves a lasting clean scent! I only wish Tide sold it in the jumbo size!
I love this product. It smells great, I like to use it on my towels, sheets, and workout clothes that I don't use fabric softener on because it leaves a great scent. The only problem is I can't find it anywhere?
Product makes blue spots on clothes and it smell digusting.
This was my favorite product until they stopped making the green lable rain scent. The purple is horrid.Why did you stop making it?
I love Tide with Febreze. However, like one of the other reviewers, I really miss the Citrus and Light Scent! I am not a big fan of floral type scents, so the Citrus one was perfect! There should be another scent like that, and the product will be even more perfect than it already is!
THE FIRST TIME I TRIED IT...I WAS HOOKED AND WILL NEVER CHANGE USING TIDE WITH FABREEZE!!!!!!
While I like both Febreze Tide products that are offered, I miss the 'Citrus and Light' scent. I realize that companies have to trim down products that don't sell very well, but at least at the laundromat I use, there are many, many upset people because of the discontinuation of this product. I would be very happy if you brought 'Citrus and Light' back to the market. If you introduce a product, consider the people who have already 'adapted' the product into their lives before yanking it from the market.Thank You
I bought front loaders almost a year ago, had never used tide before ...however with the front loaders I decided to try Tide HE Febreze Spring & Renewal as I loved the scent while at the store. I've been dedicated to it ever since. My clothes are so clean and smell so good! I would really like to see it available in a larger container, I live miles outof town and having to gather many smaller containers is a little inconvienient. If you decide to make this product available in a larger container and in Canada, please let me know...I'll be all over it!!thanks!!!
THIS IS THE ONLY DETERGENT I BUY, IT WORKS GREAT FOR THE HOUSE HOLD USE TOO I USE IT FOR MY FLOORS,BATHROOM, AND CLEAN THE COUNTERS. EVERYONE LOVES THE SMELL IN MY HOME. ALSO MY HUSBAND HAS BAD SINUS AND THIS DOES NOT MAKE HIM SNEEZ OR BREAKOUT. THANK YOU.. (COUPONS WOULD BE GREAT)
I have tried them all, even in the old top loaders and now the new front loaders. I do have to say the Tide with Febreeze Spring & Renewal dowa not compare to any other types or brands as far and how well it cleans you laundry and how great your laundry feels and smells after being washed using Tide with Febreeze Spring and Renewal. The problem I have is I cannot find the Tide with Febreeze Spring and Renew in the large bottles that are HE, I know you make it because I found it in a 26 load bottle. I need to get this in a 78 load size bottle or more. Please let me know where I can get the large bottle somewhere near me. I live in zip code 77090.
Tide with Febreze Freshness smells wonderful from start to finish. Our towels smell beautiful, the blankets smell fresh and clean, and our pajamas are so very snuggly with the soft, sweet smell.I love the Bounce with Febreze as well.
This detergent is wonderful. Like the other reviewers, it is very difficult to find this product. I would love to see it in the larger size. The small 50 oz and 100 oz, do not cut it. Please consider your consumers feedback and start producing it in a larger size.
I love the Tide with Febreze, before I committed to buying my new washer/dryer set I made sure my local store carried it in the HE type. But I am dissappointed that I have to buy it in the little bottle, PLEASE start selling it in the BIG bottle with the dispenser on the front of it!!!!
i love this product i refuse to use anything but this to wash my clothes. it also leaves a nice scent on my clothes without being too much or overpowering. this is good cause im allergic to some scents or my allergies are trigger if the scent it really strong.i love this and would recommend it to anyone its amazing :]
I love this scent!! I am always getting compliments from my friends and coworkers about how good my clothes always smell. I pair it with Downy with Febreeze and Bounce with Febreeze for the extra scent. My clothes always come out smelling and looking great. I refuse to buy anything else. Keep up the great work!!
This product smells absolutely wonderful. The bath towels and your clothes have a clean smell that lasts longer than any other detergent I have ever used. I am hooked for life on this product. I will never use another laundry detergent. It may cost a little bit more than the cheaper brands, but its well worth it.
I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS PRODUCT. I WISH THERE WERE BIGGER SIZES. THE SMELL IS WONDERFUL AND I LOVE THAT THE SCENT DOESN'T LEAVE MY CLOTHES. I NEED THE HE FOR MY WASHER HOWEVER IT IS SO DIFFICULT TO FIND IT AND IT IS NEVER THE BIG ONE I CAN ONLY FIND IT IN SMALL SIZES. I DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT.
We tried this product and love it. I love the way it smells and cleans our clothes. Tide has always been my detergent of choice.Just need to get it in bigger bottles.
The febreze compliments the cleaning power of Tide. It not only makes my clothes smell wonderful but it leaves my front-loading washing machine spring fresh. I wouldn't use any other product.
I heard from my parents about this product but always brought the cheaper detergents well I finally decided to squeeze it in the budget and I must say I will never use any other product again , My clothes smell very fresh and clean and all the stains are gone , This is the best product ever !! I love it and will always buy for now on ,Thank you Tide
I bought this for the first time and used it as i thot Tide is a good brand.. but it smells yuck..just feel like vomiting after washing my clothes..cant stand the smell..just gonna throw this yuck and smelly detergent..
The Best @ Washing
I really like the scent of this detergent and it works well for getting light- and medium- tough stains out on its own. Only thing: it does nothing for wrinkles, you need a fabric softener or dryer sheets for that.
i love tide i wish it would make more suds though if it did it would be a 5 star product/
TIDE IS GOOD. TIDE ALWAYS HAS BEEN GOOD. IT IS THE ONLY LAUNDRY SOAP PRODUCT THAT YOU ACTUALLY DO NOT NEED MORE THAN THE CAP FULL TO DO A LOAD. I WORKED IN MACHINE SHOPS FOR YEARS BUT TIDE ALWAYS CAME THROUGH. I WAS RECENTLY TAKING CARE OF MY SICK MONEY. ANY MESS THIS WILL CLEAN UP.AND THE SMELL AFTERWARDS IS DELIGHTFUL. IT LASTS AND LASTS SO WHEN YOU PULL YOUR FAVORITE NUGHTY OUT OF THE DRAWER IT SMELLS LIKE IT WAS JUST WASHED. AND IT IS A GREAT SMELL..CLEAN AND FRESH SMELL. I DO NOT WANT MY CLOTHES SMELLING LIKE LAVENDER OR FRUIT..OR EVEN HAWAIIAN! I WANT THAT NICE FRESH CLEAN SMELL!....AHHHH
Well being deployed to Kenya, and not having the access of good that we have back in the US, kind of makes it hard to enjoy. so what better way to make it a well worth deployment than by using product that we are used to back home..so over all Im satisfy on the product and Walmart on being able to ship to us armforces personel
Can't go wrong with this one. Overall great product. I will purchase again.
I was excited to try a product that is supposed to work well with workout clothes. Being a long distance runner, clothes smell after time. Since the first use of this product in a Front Loader, my new washing machine reeks of order and mildew-type smell and my clothes smell horrible and have since been trying to wash out the smell with a different detergent. What the heck??? If I left them in the machine for even an hour after washer was finished, I had to rewash my clothes. I have tried a few more times with the same result. Very disappointed, as I bought two bottles and this stuff isn't exactly cheap. I now have to buy the washing machine cleaner. Let's hope that this Tide product lives up to it's expectations!!Not sure how others are getting good results from this product, unless top loaders are getting different result!
always love this product, I like the fact that it was secured to keep the product from spilling
This is a great product. And a very good value. I used to use Tide but this product does just as good as the leading Tide. And smells great too.
I have used a lot of different laundry detergents. None beat Gain.I had washed some pillow cases and put up. Forgot about them and months later when I remembered them they smelled as fresh as the day they were washed.
Gain a powerful cleaning detergent. Regarding this particular scent, it is not that strong and has a light scent which is wonderful. The cleaning and removing stains that this detergent does is comparable to Tide. I am a heavy sweater and this scent has not disappointed me. Like Mango tango and Lavendar scents this Hawaiian scent is milder but just as powerful with Fabreeze. Will definitely stock up!! The only con I have is that I could not find the Fabric Refresher Hawaiian Aloha scent Softner:(
I purchased this product and a smaller bottle, the smaller bottle by accident because I thought it was fabric softner. It was a great deal, and being ill it makes it a lot easier to get the heavier things that I need without having to get someone to take me to the store. It had free shipping, so that was an added bonus, don't know if that's a regular thing or not, but it made it an even better value. Wouldn't hesitate to purchase from them again and have delivered to my house.
I am a huge fan of Gain and the price of this bottle is great. I wash like crazy, but I still have this bottle and my pockets are not hurting.
most people will love the scent and the febreeze fresh smell i forgot a load of cloths in washer for 4 days when away from home and they had begun to mildew i reran them with this product and they smelled great again
It smells extremely and get your clothes clean.
After my car having that staleodor for awhile I came across these on the Walmart website. I decided to purchase a two pack and now wish I had purchased more. Finally after that smell, my car smells febreeze wonderful everytime I get in it. I wish I had found these earlier. Beforew I used to hate getting into my smelly car and now I love it. It smells wonderful! Thank you Febreeze and walmart!
OMG I highly recommend this product for anyone looking for a genuine lasting air freshner for thier car. Unlike many of the other products I have used in the past, I can smell this product EVERY time I get in my car!! Everyone needs to buy this!!
better than the dollar scents we have been buying. The price was great for the twin pack. We love febreze products.
Cheap and effective
Great smell, but does not last 30 days. Only last a few weeks.
This smells so good.
The product smells very nice but it is a very strong aroma. I would not put it in the same room with people that have any lung issues or allergies to certain smells, nor would I put it in a room with a pet. If there was a way to make the scent come out even more gently than it does...and I have it on low, I would prefer it better. I had to unplug mine until I find another room for it. In a large house I don't think you would have this problem.
An entire bottle of formula leaked out into my daughter's play pen and it smelled HORRIBLE like rotten milk. I doused it with this antimicrobial febreze and the smell was completely gone as soon as it dried. I've sworn by this stuff ever since!
this product does the trick in the bathroom! ease of use and smells wonderful. Seem to go through them quickly but I think it is just my never ending goal to have the rooms smelling good. I would recommend to anyone.
Love the item as it works fine with a beautiful smell
This band seems to last a little longer than the other brands. But it is more expensive. The scent is ok - a little sweet.
I love the smell of this combination! Smells so fresh & clean!! It last about 30 days so I always stack up when I go to Walmart
Great smell & not bothersome to my sensitive sinus at all!!! Love it!
I love it, it smells awesome!! My husband was impressed. He noticed as soon as he walked in the room. It put a smile on his face.
You will notice the difference and so will others. It's very frangrant and overpowers fowl odors such as cat box and young crowds odors. I'm am pleased with the feedback I've gotten and you will be pleased too.
Perfect!!!!
I got so mad I threw the whole entire unit in the trash. The only reason I even bought it was because Walmart sent the plug in unit to me for free with an order that took longer than normal to fill, so I thought I would give it a try and order the refills since I had the plug in unit with no cartridge for it. I highly recommend trying "Lysol Freshmatic" brand air freshener spray that is in one of those plastic things you put on the wall, it sprays out automatically every so many minutes. I have one in my bathroom and kitchen and you ALWAYS smell it...unlike this Febreze junk.
I love the smell of this fresh gain scent. Do recommend! :)
nice scent and very convenient to have home delivery when needed, usually ordered within a week of running out along with other items needed that can be ordered from Walmart.com
I've always loved and used the linen & sky scent of febreze, but walmart was out of stock, so I got this scent. How bad could it be...right? It smells like someone accidentally dropped some potpourri into a jug of cheap...cheap perfume...and then called it febreze spring renewal. YUCK! WAY too strong and WAY too sweet smelling. Almost sickeningly so.
I bought a rolling duffle bag which had a very unpleasant petroleum-like odor. Leaving it in the sun helped, but it was still annoying. I contacted Fabreze and they recommended using this product for my issue. It's been about 2 weeks since I sprayed the bag and the offensive odor seems to be gone.I'm quite pleased.
I love febreeze! This is great for doggy odors.
I love febreze and I will always use it!
OMG! I love this product so much... The sense of having to enter your home smeling nice and fresh it's wondeful... I strongly recommend it.
I have to plug in my nightlight every night! Thanks Walmart this is a great product and great value. Smells good. Love it!
I have one in the plug in close to my front door and ive recieved plenty of complements from people on how great our house smells, its one of the first things out of there mouths when they walk it. My stepdad even went out and bought there house one. I love coming home and the first thing i smell is just wonderful! I dont think you really notice it when your home and have been home because youve became accustomed to the smell but its def noticeable for about the first ten minutes when you get home or when you walk into different rooms and most the time i can usually smell the difference when it changes to the other daul scents. Im beyond pleased with my noticeables, my only promblem is that i only like a few scents that are out right now, lol.
I was so excited to purchase the febreze noticeables for my home. I picked one up at my local Walmart, along with the apple spice/caramel apple oil, and plugged it in as soon as I got home.HEAVEN! For about two hours my home smelled BEAUTIFUL, but then the smell was gone. I picked up three more febreze noticeables with the same scent thinking that more of them would create a noticeable effect. I now have four plugins in my fairly small home, and still no scent.As I thought I may have just adjusted to the smell and become unable to notice it I waited until my husband got home to write this review. Since he was gone when I first bought these and had not been home in a few weeks I thought maybe I would gain insight from his opinion, and I did. The scent is not noticeable at all, even when he first walked through the door!Sadly this product was a HUGE disappointment, and not I am stuck with four plugins that don't make a difference at all :(
Love this candle. Even my son noticed the clean scent.
This candle retains is amazing scent, unlike most candles that smell good before you burn them. It doesn't take long until your home is smelling like Gain laundry detergent. My living room and kitchen are open to each other and it only takes about 5 minutes for the rooms to be freshened up.
I was ordering some things from Walmart and came across this candle. I read all the reviews and looked at the video postings and thought "I'm going to give this a try." I don't think I had it lit 5 minutes and the smell had circulated throughout my entire apartment. If you want a candle to get rid of any odors you have. . cooking, smoke, dirty socks. . this is it!!!!!!!!!
I really like this candle...it smells pretty and I can put it in my kitchen in within 30 min. the smell is in my laundry room, living room and slightly back to the bedrooms! It is stronger smelling than the other febreeze candle scents but I like that since you only need one to cover a large area vs. 2 in the other scents. Also it burns very evenly. All in all I would reccomend this and I would buy it again.
I don't have bad allergies but, my boyfriend does. And, he's allergic to cats & I have one. I started using this product to see if it would help at all & it really does. I spray it on EVERYTHING!!! The only thing is that it doesn't last very long since I use it so much. I literally buy at least 6 bottles at a time. Plus, it's really hard to find it stores. I haven't bought any in a while since I haven't been able to find any & I can tell the difference it makes for him. This is definitely something I would recommend. It really works great!
this works great when sprayed on fabrics or furniture
These are great for home use. I think the regular price is too much especially if you change them weekly as suggested. The ones I bought here were reduced which was a good thing.
smells wonderful.. lingers around not too long, then disappears but its good. I wish it could last longer.
A great product. Freshen up any room without having to spray multiple times, two sprays are good enough since it gives away a strong scent, depending on the room size.
i love this product it smells soooo good, and last for days upon days. i would recommend this product to anyone.! who wants a fresher house
Very mellow light. Much safer than an actual candle but gives a similar flickering light.
Walmart definitely has the best price too! I sell these as part of my business and thank God Walmart.com carries them! Check out www.cherylscreativeblock.etsy.com to see just some of what I can do with these!
I enjoy not having to worry about a flame.
Febreze keeps my apartment and furniture smelling nice and clean between cleanings, washings, etc. I use it everyday along with the Febreze Pet spray, and no one would guess I have a service animal when they don't see him. It is a terrific product.
Product actually eliminates odors quickly and effectively. Love the fresh scent. This is one scented product that doesn't bother my sinusitis, used sparingly. I always have supply on hand.
I LOVE THE SCENT OF THIS FEBREEZE..LASTS LONG AND MAKES THE WHOLE ROOM REFRESHED, VERY PLEASED AND A GREAT PRICE
Scent is pretty mild and not overpowering. I love the freshness it brings with every application. I highly recommend this product.
what can I say..it's Fabreze! It is a very good price.
This does not smell like lavender or vanilla kinda a weird smell, throwing it out will not buy again. YUK
It didn't smell as good as I thought it would, but at least it's not as horrible as the Meadows and Rain one. I bought it to use in my dorm room. My roommate liked it.
This scent is not that strong.
Excellent price, fast delivery!! And, who would not enjoy the fresh smell of this product. I used it as such long before it was advertised for hosehole freshener.
I like to spray this on everything , it leaves my things smelling good and refreshed.
I love this product. It does what it is supposed to do. I use it everyday and it gives my sheets a sweet, fresh smell! Spray bottle is pretty effective too. Highly recommend!
This smells so great that when my family gets home for the day. They all think I did laundry all day!
This product cost was approximately $14.00. The filler screens are $10.00 (two to a package). The screen is suppose to last one week. After three days the scent was gone. The batteries died right away. Total regret.
I hope that you continue to keep these products in stock as I am a senior and I think that they are so much safer than using candles. This is the best thing that they came out with to use so there is no chance of a fire starting. I really love the cranberry pear and the orchard cider that is for the fall season the best.
I have purchased this product in the past in the store, and it is exactly the same price on here as it is at my local WalMart. At the moment, mostly because of the season change, we don't have this one on the shelf without the lighted base unit.The base of this product is just to make it look like a candle, when really there is not a candle there at all. As another person stated, the shades do loose their scent over time. I have also noticed that as long as your room is somewhat warm, the shades will release scent into your room rather quickly and should continue to do so for about a week provided that your room is not to big for just one unit. I am not sure, but I think that one unit is able to release scent for a week in a room that is about the size of a large bathroom or small kitchen. Regaurdless of what others may think of this product, I love the way that it works!!!
Very strong smell that I did not consider pleasant. I put them outside for a week and let them air out before bringing them inside. I didn't buy them for the smell, I bought them for their look, so it was only mildly inconvenient to have to leave them outside for a week.
Love this stuff and you can't find it in the stores. I had to order it online. I have 9 cats and 11 exotic animals and it works great! I like using it on my ferret shelves even though it's for fabric. A little misting on the carpet freshens the room. The smell is not overpowering which is a good thing since I have allergies!
As a disabled senior with a service dog...and a neat freak...I depend on Febreze to keep my apartment smelling nice and clean. While my apartment is immaculate, in summer or winter when everything is closed, air can quickly become musty and stale smelling...but not with Fabreze...even my service animal appreciates it as he loves the smell too!
Is not as effective as you would expect for the price
I bought 10 Willow Blossom Luminary Refills for my daughter who moved out of state. They are her favorite and not available where she lives. After an exhaustive search, I found and purchased enough to last her awhile. Walmart is the only place in the Chicago area that carries them online!
I loved this product from the ones we initially purchased from our local Walmart Store. I have not seen this fragrance this season in my local Walmart and will be calling talking to the manager and insisting that this be a stock item and will purchase a case for me and maybe more for gifts to friends. It is highly recommended by me, it is so fresh and the aroma is so soothing to everyone I have told about it. Keep up the good work stocking such products in all the Walmarts and Sams Clubs. Love you Fabreze and Walmart for stocking such a good product.
works will i should of brought a different scent. but the product works. will buy again just a different scent.
Love febreze products and this smell is the only one I never get sick of .must be the spice smell that i like.. nice
I usually love anything Febreze; but not this candle. I kept it lit for hours and even if someone came into my home hours after candle was lit, they detected no fragrance whatsoever. I'm very disappointed.
Gets rid of all unpleasant odors of college living.
Very good, I definately will buy it again.
This product is awesome. Fragrance lasts a long, long time. Very fresh and soothing.
Nice Tropical Scent
I use it in the bathroom, eliminates bad smells immediately and leaves a very light and pleasant smell.
this is very nice! I love it.
I got this because of another reviewer's comment that it masks cigarette smell really well. So, I bought it to use on the way to work (good impressions and whatnot). I was slightly weary that it would be overpowering, or worse than the actual cigarette smell. However, it is light, airy, refreshing, and masks the smoke really well. Also, it gives my car a nice refresher without being overpowering.
to freshen up the house
While I love Febreze Air Effects, this one wasn't what I expected.I ordered for the lavender scent, but found it to be more vanilla than lavender. It's nice, but just not what I was expecting.
One of the nicest smelling aerosols on the market and it keeps my home smelling fresh.
Hadn't seen this fragrance before... it's very pleasant!
Smells great and awesome value and size for the money. Im glad febreeze finally came out with a deodorizer especially in this scent.
Good product, I will purchase again, but certainly not as good as the commercial leads one to believe.
This Candle lasts 30 Hours and will make your home smell great. Especially if you have pets. This Candle is well worth the price.
I love this product when you spray it, it initially fills the room with a beautiful lavender and vanilla smell, however, it does not stay that way long, but for a moment your house does smell quite beautiful. I about use up a whole can in a couple of weeks just to keep the smell I want.
Its a very nice product
Great item and great smell.
I actually purchased this by accident, I love gain, it smells so good, and had puchased the largest size, thought this was the softner that went along with it. It was my error for not looking well enough to see what it was, however I will use it and it won't go to waste. It was still a great deal, and I was able to go back and find the softner in the sheets version and order them a few days later. I am never dissappointed with the way Gain works for me, but it's nice to find it at such a great price and free shipping really helps.
Ok so over all this products worked well. I had a roommate living in a room with an on suite bath and he had 2 dogs. Unbeknown to me he never gave the dogs a bath for the 7months he lived in the room (they were predominately out door dogs except at night when they came in the house to sleep) and he let the dogs defecate and urinate in the room, to which he used spot remove to remove the stains. Ha ha ha... all it did was exacerbate the problem because now I had very bright shiny clean spots in the middle of an over all fitly rug. So I bought a steam cleaning solution that I knew would most defiantly neutralize the "pet smell". This product did a wonderful job with that. Unfortunately it also set off my allergies like no ones business. I had cold symptoms (nose running, scratchy/sore throat, and water itchy eyes for about 2 days even after opening the windows to that room.
i love this product and the smell is amazing! walmart has the best deal on it, however i cant order it from them anymore because when it arrived it had opened and they started to fry up, plus it wasnt shipping with the plastic cover its suppose to come with. so i didnt have any place it store the wipes.
Great product! Cleans my hardwood floors beautifully. Makes them shine! I reccomend these highly to everyone!They also smell great!
Easy and Convenient!
These dusters are fantastic. I have used them for several years and they make dusting a fun chore. Not only are the rooms dust free, the lavender scent leaves the room smelling clean and relaxing.
I use this for light clean ups in between the weekly heavy cleaning. It is easy to use, works well, leaves no streaks, and the fragrance is lovely. I had unexpected company the other night and pulled this swiffer out and cleaned my bathroom and kitchen floor before they arrived without having to pull out the Eureka vacuum cleaner or Shark steamer. I love this product and I wish I would have bought it five years ago when my daughter-in-law Lee told me about it.
We love our swiffer, but use it a lot. So the cost for it adds up pretty quickly. These were a great price and they smell wonderful! We typically don't like things with a scent so I was worried, but this is nice a fresh smelling, and fades quickly. One thing we love is how it holds all the ickies, so I don't have to touch them. Simply grab the cloth, and toss! :D Whats even better about this pack is that it is 3 packages of 12, so you don't have to worry about them drying out before you could use the 36!
When the item shipped, the plastic containers crack and the liquid leaked ALL over the box. when I received the box, the postal service had to place clear plastic around the entire box and tape it up to keep from damaging other mail. So, I will not order online again due to the shipping difficulties, because now there is not sufficient liquid in the wipes, I have to moisten them...
I love this product. No mop to mess with. A bit expensive though!
I like the smell of this product but it doesnt transfer to the ground. It collects dust but not sand.
make the house smell great after you vaccum.
as I said before, W in walmart stand for Wonderful.It is easy to buy on line like the other items I havepurchased. Swiffer products are the best and costless,
I am very impressed with the bags. I almost got rid of my Oreck because of the costly bag replacement. I noticed the Frebreze vacuum bags while browsing for a new vacuum cleaner. They are the best! The whole house smells great while using them. I have pets and no more smelly vacuum odor!
Excellent products and price
I love the prices at Walmart I wish I could shop for grocery's on line. I love the quick response I have gotten when there was a problem. They were willing to refund or fix the situation immediately.
cleans great, after cleaning you still have the Frebreze Meadows & Rain scent that lasts for days.

After receiving this product have been using it ever since, it's that good. I use only three cups for my laundry with the crystals and it last still my next wash. This is a fabulous item and will continue to use because it leaves no film, greasy spots only a fresh smell. Tide is the best with outer and under garments stain and odor removals. A True gem!
Excellent product. Always consistent, no harsh chemicals.
If you love the spell of gain detergent, then you will also like this fragrance.. It has a clean smell that makes you think that you have just done laundry.
This is a great Product. When i first smelled the scratch & sniff i immediately thought of another similiar scent in the noticeables collection... the Linen&Sky. The Gain noticeable smells like laundry detergent( Gain) and the linen and sky smells more airy, like a fabric softner to me. But i did notice that with a different febreze noticeable called meadows & Rain, that as the oil levels got lower the scent is hard to pick up. Even on the High Setting . Back to the Gain Noticeable, if you like the smell of soap,and things that smell very clean... that's all that i can think of with this scent . I think you will like this product!
We love the smell of Gain & it's the only type of laundry detergent my husband will use. The scent is strong enough to cover a few day old trash can so that we don't have to take it out quite as often! So pleased with this product that I've bought them for most rooms in my home. Everyone has worked and there are no complaints.
I love this scent. It smells so good. When I spray it once I must spray it yet again. If you love a fresh and clean scent, this would be the right purchase for anyone. But I must warn you that if you spray too much, it may make you cough. But it's good. Just turn your head when you're spraying and give it 15 seconds or so to come down. You will love it!
I sprayed my curtains, carpets and furniture. My living room smelled great for over 24 hours.
I bought this to replace the other brand I had in my bathroom, but I find it keeps disappearing for uses all over the house. It was taken once for spraying the air return duct, which made the whole house smell great when changing the filter. Good thing I have the spare for when it disappears. Love this scent.
nice
This is the best air freshener. You don't hear the loud spraying of air-freshener, and it works great. Great value 2 pack.
I have been using another product for years but it has a slight medicinal smell so thought I would try this. I am happy that I did and will use this from now on. Quite refreshing!
Love the Febreze products. Excellent price.
I have a small apartment and I'm a smoker with a dog. This freshens the air. Next time I'll try a different fragrance.
Overall, I think that as a quick air freshener, this is great. But don't expect miracles. This will mask the scent but not eliminate it.
Love the smell of regular Febreze, & Gain detergent, so thought I this was a win/win. In theory, yup, however pull the spray trigger - cough, cough.
I have been sing this products for years.
Febreze candles are great, but this scent is too "piney" for me. Lasts a long time, burns well, good scent distribution, just not the greatest fragrance.
take it with you when you travel and put it on your air conditioner in your hotel takes away that hotel smell during your stay
I don't like this product at all. When I opened the package, one of the clips seemed to have more in it than the other. I haven't had it for 30 days and i't s almost gone. I thought about taking it back, but I just decided not to purchase this item ever again.
Smells good and works great. Hard to find this scent though. When I see it, I buy multiple cans of it and restock the pantry. Terrific autumn scent.
For those of you out there that love the scent of apples and cinnamon, this product is for you. It absorbs mal-odors and leaves a fresh, clean scent. I buy and use often.
Good stuff! It works very well at taking care of unwanted orders.
I constantly use this to "refresh" my work clothes each morning, because I don't want to have to take them to the dry cleaner every day. This product works great!
I spray Febreze on our furniture on our pillows and lightly on the carpet after vacuuming it gives the whole house a nice fresh scent that is not overpowering.,
smell like summertime!! Fresh, sunny and pleasant.
does not work as advertised.
Try a scent, and if you don't like it try another - that's what I did after my daughter complained about the "linens" one. the "fruit" one was too strong but we've settled on the "storm" ones. It really does cover smells, like the spray does - it doesn't just add to and try to overpower background smells like most car fresheners. Not that our car was stinky, but after several years of spilled juice, wet feet and the occasional melted chocolate bar, I used to spray the inside with a bottle of Febreze every few weeks or so and that took care of it. With the car vents, the smells just go away after a bit of time and don't come back. The literature says they last about a month and that seems about right, maybe a little longer when its cold just about a month when it's hot out due to faster evaporation.
These have changed my household! With two dogs & an old, smaller home, there was a tendency for my house to get a little musty, even after serious vacuming and spraying air freshener. I bought one pack to try it out & have since gone back & bought 2 more packs! They give just enough scent to not overwhelm my scent sensitive husband, but make a huge difference in the whole house's smell. Every one I've purchased has worked beautifully. I'm hooked & not wasting my money on other air fresheners again!!
I love febreze fragrances. It can be a bit pricey but I love having my entire smelling good and not having that unpleasant smell. It lasts a long while and sometimes after the oil has evaporated, I still can smell the scent.
These are GREAT, IF the warmers themselves work. That's the problem I've had...too many warmers that were duds. So I got rid of all my febreeze and went to AirWick & Glade. Please make more reliable warmers.
These luminaries are great! They go with most any decor, and give off just the right amount of light. Not too soft, not too bright. Granted, the shades are strongly scented and last for a couple days at most, I dont even care if the shades are scented anymore. I just like the lighting. I have also gone to a craft store and purchased seasonal themed scrapbook paper and made my own shades.I have given one to all my grandchildren for night lights, and they love them. The 4 hour auto turn off time is just right. They do go through batteries quickly, but I have alleviated the problem by buying rechargeable batteries.If you buy these, you won't regret it. There are so many fun things to do with them!!
Nice item, smells really nice and is very pretty, much better than a real candle, safer.
I like the lamp a lot for decoration, but the only problem I have with it is that there's no on/off switch. It does shut off after 4 hours, but I don't enjoy having to take the batteries in and out, or removing the shade to have to turn it off or on when I feel like it. I actually only got it because I received the Halloween themed shades as a gift, so I wouldn't have purchased it other wise, but it has its own pro's and con's. Thanks.
I specifically wanted the flameless candle for our breakroom at work and it was impossible to find in the store so I ordered it online. The flame goes for 4 hours before shutting it'self off. It's a nice soft light and it's sweet. I think the aroma would work best in smaller rooms.
It is that time of year when your relatives arrive and last thing you want is an errant smell. The house is spotless, why not compliment it with one of the many scents of Febreze Noticeable. I love the Apple Spice combination, it is perfect for the holidays. A warm welcome home smell as you open the door. As an added bonus, it has a little night light.
I like this product. I wish it would last longer with one application. If you have a very strong order, (pet or otherwise), you may want to try 2 to 5 applications. It has a very pleasant scent.
I was about to order some big name candles, but they were going to charge me $20 to ship. Glad I bought a couple of these instead. Love the smell. Clean burning, last a long time and the glass holders are definitely reusable!
I love the hawaiian smell when I am at the house just chilling out and the weather is another nice day and I am resting/reading out on the patio. Great smell when you have your close friends over and everyone has just had a snack and just visiting.
Great Scent - I love the fresh smell in my bathroom. I'm addictive to this. I will purchase again.
I'm a repeat buyer but I get the various scents.
You will need this spray for a pet free smell. Just scoop and then spray with this product. You will be a happy pet owner. lol
I purchased this fragrance to remind my young nephews to eat more fruits. This is a great reminder for myself as well. Nice for those spring days when you are in the process of cleaning and discarding old things that you will not nor can not wear any longer.
like the Gain Febreze candle and it doesn't. . .at least to me. I have ordered two Gain candles and burn them after I cook and instantly whatever I'm cooking, chicken, salmon cakes. .the odor is gone. I lit this one after cooking and I really didn't notice that it was overpowering any odors. . it just doesn't do it for me like the Gain scent. . well, I'll be sticking to what works for me and so I'll order the Gain from now on.
Got this and like it real well. It goes with the Febreze line well. It hasn't been in my car that long, kept forgetting to put it in.
I don't really like air fresheners because they're so temporary, but the smell on this is lovely and it lasts longer than I would expect!
I have not been able to find this in stores or on line. It's the only product that works to knock down the allergens in the carpet, and sofa. Safe enough to use on the bed and pillows.
Why isn't this made in the refill size?????
I can't find it in stores so was delighted to see that Walmart could order it for me and deliver it for free! This is the best deal going. For staples, I can put together an order at home in comfort and Walmart will deliver it to my door for free. No wear and tear on either my truck or myself fighting hoards of people only to find they don't have the item I want. Great item and great Walmart for this new program.
As long as you don't really have much carpeting or furniture that you want to use this product on it may be a good deal for you otherwise in just one day of use you'll probably use up at least half of the bottle because it goes pretty quickly.
I wanted something to spray mother in law's bed with, I am her in home caregiver. It smells nice and doesn't stain.
This product did exactly what I purchased it for. We bought a couch that had been stored in a garage for several years. Great shape but a definite musty smell. One use of Febreze and the smell is gone. Also used it on some pillows from a smoky house and that worked too.
Ive tried all kinds of car ar fresheners. none compare to this one... this smells amazing and very manly. the unit isn't a big bulky device like a lot of the other ones and the smell is surprisingly natural and not overwhelming. i look forward to the first breath i take in my car every day and sometime try to take a whiff as im driving. love this product wish i could find it more often but i guess im not the only one who loves this this much!
I have used and will continue to use Febreze car. I love the scents and they stay and last in your car forever! Thanks walmart for carrying this product.
Even though I could no longer use it, it did eliminate the stink that was in my car.
My Febreeze Car Vent Air Freshener really made our mini-van smell great throughout the van! My only peeve about the product is that it is no refillable. The scent holder is a nice compact design and would be more cost effective if I could just flip open the front of it and replace the scent pack. Just a suggestion....
I love most Febreeze products, although mine never work like their commercials. These car vent fresheners are defective. I had one car vent freshener that was fine but when that one was empty and I placed a second one in my car vent, I found that it leaked after being in the car for about 24 hours. That leak ran down my NEW CAR's dash and ATE THE PAINT off the dash and basically RUINED MY CAR's dash! I'm furious with what happened and will no longer purchase this product. Be aware that this could happen to your car too.
Getting into the car, even in a scorching hot day, is a pleasure. No more stuffiness! Can't wait to go driving!
Just bought 2 of the Hawaian Aloha car fresheners. Both my husband and my car smelled real bad, mine of old dog and his of chicken feed so we couldn't wait to try these fresheners. In less then one trip we could tell the difference the bad odor is GONE! Thank you, D. Tucker NC
I bought the car clip and really liked it. I like that you can adjust the amount of fragrance. I have been looking for refill tho and can not find them anywhere
The candle in this gift set is the most awesome scent ever ! My best friend had one lit for Thanksgiving and I absolutely loved it. I went and bought my own today. It is a must have.
They should have this sent year around. It smells wonderful without being over powering.
I ordered it for home delivery and it spilled through the box on my porch and on the plastic bag it was sealed in. The cap was not on tight enough. I lost 1/3 of the product.
great product. arrived without leaking
Can't beat the price for the size!!!
I love this formula for sensative skin and the fresh scent is awesome. This large size goes a long way and the price is excellent. I am always pleased with Arm & Hammer products.
Works on all types of laundry and does not cause my daughter any allergic reactions.
I love this detergent. The smell, cleaning power, and price are amazing.
A great product that cleans clothes great and even a few easy stains. It smells great too.
Not only is Arm & Hammer Liquid: 2X Concentrated Clean Burst Laundry Detergent the best detergent (cleaning power and scent), but it is an unbeatable value! I couldn't find it for the longest time, then it reappeard in our local Wal-Mart, so I grabbed three right away! I hope it stays in stock indefinitely. Truth be told, I love almost all Arm & Hammer products for their quality and value. When you couple Arm & Hammer's product value with Wal-Mart's low prices, you have two companies that understand the tough economy and the needs of the average consumer. Thank you Wal-Mart and thank you Arm & Hammer
This is what I buy when Tide isn't on sale. It works almost just as well, you just have to use a bit more to get the job done. My only complaint about this product specifically is that the cap doesn't have slots or any sort of guideline for how much to use. So you just have to guess, meaning you're most likely using too much. This is done on purpose so consumers use more than they need to, and then buy more product, yada yada. Not that big of a deal, but I wanted to point that out.
love the smell and feel of cleanliness
I think this product is very good and worth the money
looove this!!!! my clothes get clean and smells good at a low cost.
The detergent was very good and it washes excellent.I would use this again.
I have been using this product for a year now. It meets my expectations well. The cost is much cheaper at Walmart. I will continue to use it and recommend it.
This get my laundry sooo clean! It also smells so good that I dont even feel bad wen I forget the fabric softener.
I WILL NEVER RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT, SAY IT WASHES 96 LOADS I DIDN'T EVEN GET 36 LOADS OUT OF THE 2X ARM AND HAMMER LAUNDRY DETERGENT.
Nice scent!
I purchased this laundry detergent on a recommendation from a friend. I was highly skeptical about the ability of this product to effectively cleanse my clothing and bedding as I am VERY picky about what detergents I use. I have lots of primitive tea stained decor and mercantile linens in my home and I must say that this detergent cleans better than tide! The colors are so much brighter and darks are now deep and rich.The scent is awe inspiring and my linens and clothing have NEVER been this clean and fresh! I am NOW an Arm and Hammer convert!
Cheap, effective, and it smells fantastic.
I was having trouble with "stinky" towels. No matter what I did, except hot water and bleach (which was ruining the color) worked. But, this stuff helps even in cold water!
This is the only detergent I have ever seen that takes smoke smell out of clothes. We used it when a family friend came to stay with us after her house burnt- she borrowed some of my clothes while I threw hers in the washer, and miracle of miracles, the smell came out. So, when she was allowed to go back and salvage what she could, we used this on all her linens and clothing- only the things in the bedroom adjacent to where the fire started were smoke-damaged too heavily for this to save. That said, the only problem I have ever had with this detergent is that it doesn't work particularly well on cold only wash cycles.
I LIKE THIS DETERGENT, WORKS VERY WELL MAKES CLOTHING SMELL NICE AND GETS THEM CLEAN...I WAS PLEASED WITH USING THIS PRODUCT
This is now the only laundry detergent I will buy...It leaves my clothes super clean and smelling fresh. It even gets out the tough odors my kids clothes have after an afternoon in the sun playing sports!
I have no complaints with this product. I feel it is just as good as the top washing powders at a lower price.
I love the way this product cleans and freshens my clothing. It works wonderful! Thumbs up all the way!:-)
i bought this laundry detergent because everytime i went to hug my boyfriend his clothes smelled so good so i started buying it i love the smell i love the price it is an amazing product
I m now fan of this product,clears all stains literally!!
I operate a 4000 square foot thrift store. this Laundry detergent saves me from sending some stained items to the rag bin because it takes out stains other laundry detergents don't. It gives the clothes a clean fresh scent as well. I have a front load washer at home, and this detergent does well in it in liquid form. Best Value for the money.
Other people in my household loves this product, and will order it again. Did a good job onthe clothes, even on babyfood stains.
Product cleans clothes well and leaving a fresh, clean smell to them.
This works great for me...no matter what the laundry problem is...
I use this product on my baby clothes. Seems to work well if I get it on the diaper mishap outfits soon after the occurance. I leave it on and just toss it in later when I do laundry.I DO NOT recommend getting this shipped to your home. They apparently know it isn't a great item to ship since they taped the top and put it in a plastic zippy bag... but it still leaked all over the box.They need a "this end up" box to ship it in. Would have had a lot less leaking I would imagine.
Cleans clothes awesome and smells great
My family usually gets detergent while grocery shopping when I am never there so I never have to worry about picking and choosing. I just saw a good price and a good size and bought it. Glad I did, this detergent is better than the small bottles my family buys for $9 each at the grocery store. It does not leave soap residue and makes your clothes feel and smell soft and fresh.
This detergent is awesome. It gets your clothes clean and smells great!...plus a little of this detergent goes along way, it even gets out the ring around the collar off my hubby's white work shirts withOUT scrubbing. This is my new detergent that I will stick with, plus you do not have to by the OXI cubes to add to it because it is already included. Great value for your money too!
smells great cleans great great price only problem was when I received it it leaked however I called customer service & they sent me out another 1 out free of charge very pleased with the service
Nothing works like it. I've been using Tide for years and Purex gets the stains that Tide can't. The small bottle lasts forever and for $3, you can't beat it! I love the smell of the 'After the Rain' variety. Try it, you have nothing to lose!
I really love the bargain you get with Purex. It smells wonderful, cleans your clothes extremely well, and is also one of the few detergents that I can use on my sensitive skin (even though it has a scent!)
Cleans my clothes nicely and leaves a nice, faint smell on the clothing.
I considered this detergent as one of the best because of its value and great price... I have sensitive skin and for that reason, I am alergic to some detergent brands. However, this product really works well... You will get excellent results on any fabric and the smell of clean that leaves on your clothes after the first wash it's incredible... I strongly recommend it...
I am not sure if my laundry load was too small, or if its because I have a front loader and am required to use a small amount of a concentrate in the dispenser and not directly with the laundry.All of the laundry that I did had so much left over soap and aroma that it was rubbing off and stinking up the entire house.I am pretty sure its not Purex's fault and it mustve been something that I did wrong.Might only work for top loaders that dont require just a bit of a liquid concentrate
Perfect for apartment living where you have to lug clothing and detergent to a laundry room - no more struggling with heavy, cumbersome detergent bottles for this apartment dweller! It could be improved only in two ways: one, it could have a formula with fabric softener and two, it could come in a larger pack. $3 for 18 packs is a great price (and it does clean well as all Purex products do), but if you've got a large family that takes multiple loads to clean all their clothes, you will run out quickly. Wish I could give it four-and-a-half stars instead of just four.
Very conveniant. No muss. No fuss.
Purex works as well as other top brands and these packs really do get th job done! I would def. recommend to anyone and everyone :)
I've used Cascade for years in all of its various forms - powder, liquid, and now the packets. These are by far the best for cleaning and spot removal. I have very hard water, and the complete packets leave my dishes (and dishwasher) spotless and very clean. I'd highly recommend them and will definitely keep buying them myself.
This Cascade does not contain Phosphates and leaves spots on glasses and a white deposit on dishes. Cascade is available with Phosphates, Goggle it.
This stuff is awesome. I have arthritis and can't always wash heavy stuff. Now, with a little help, they get washed without me. Walmart.com makes it easy for me to get the heavy packages home
Good product I use it daily since it came out.
great product does the job sparkling clean dishes
I was so excited to get these since they have been advertised a lot i thought they would work like a charm. i unloaded the dishwasher today and 8 dishes did not come clean! They dont work at all. Dont waste your money!!!!!
Because of the great rating by ConsumerReports, I decided to give this one a try. I couldn't belive the amazing results compared what I was using. (Cascade and Kirkland Gel from Costco)Everything comes out sparkling clean. No spots or residue left behind. Save yourself some money and give these a try before getting a new dishwasher. You will be completely amazed.The Finish Quantum Power Ball is pre-measured so there is no guesswork or waste. It dissolves completely and fits any dishwasher detergent cup. I would definately recommend this dishwasher detergent for everyone.
Dish washing detergent has come a long way.... love this
I will buy nothing but this product. I do at least 1 load per day with this product and have only had a problem with it not dissolving once. I've used many other products and this is the best, hands-down. (My dishwasher is not one of those expensive-fancy ones, either.)
This worked great for me. I'm not good about putting a drying agent into my dishwasher on a regular basis. This stuff is really convenient and does a good job of cleaning the dishes. I've only had one instance where it did not work well and that was becasue the compartment for detergent did not open during the cycle so the packet never dissolved - every other time it's been great. For me, this is all about convenience i just drop it in and run the dishwasher.
i bought this awhile back thinking it would do a better job of cleaning my dishes but it does not. sorta. more often than not i open up the dishwasher after it has run to find the pac still sitting in the dishwasher somewhere, undissolved, my dishes not clean. it is pretty irritating. so i would not reccomend this product.
This really has powerful dish washing formula. Most of the dishes doesn't prewash. It does really good loooking. We can really see the difference on the dishes after couple of washes with this detergent specially steel dishes are sparkling.Also it is hassel free just pick one Quantum powerball and place it the dishwasher and no need to worry about liquid spilling over etc.I am very impressed with this product, I almost using this every day for past 2 months. I haven't seen any undissolved particles sitting on the dishwasher.I will definitely recommend this product. Very reliable
As a dishwasher it worked just as good as my other dishwasher tab, but you still need to pre-rinse the dishes if you want your dishes clean. I tried using 2 tabs instead of 1 and that helped, but not worth the price if you have to double up on the amount of tabs you are using to wash 1 load of dishes.
I was always curious about how this detergent cleans because it has 3 different types of cleaners packed in a small cube. It may be small, but it packs a punch. After using this a couple of times, I'm sold & am switching to this brand from now on. It cleaned better, doesn't leave a filmy haze on my glasses & I saw less spots on my plastic containers.
This is so easy to use - just take out one of the little packs, put it where you normally put your dish-washing detergent, and start your dishwasher. It leaves the dishes clean and free from spots or any sort of residue. It is much more convenient than measuring out the powder or gel detergents.
I found its a great product when i have to upload and dunload my diswasher everyday at least once a day.
I started buying this it works well and last longer....
It cleans very well. Smells good too.
great price and our laundry smelled fantastic and was soft
All 2x Ultra Stainlifter Liquid Laundry Detergent is just GREAT. Works well on stains and has nice smell. You can get big size in great price- u can't beat that :)!!!!
THIS DETERGENT DON'T WASH CLOSE TO 96 LOADS I WILL NOT BE BUYING THIS PRODUCT AGAIN.
get this instead of dreft for sure!! alot better deal and the exact same thing. it has no dyes or fragances so it is great for the baby and the whole family that has senstive skin.
This is the best thing for people with skin sensitivity. I have use this product for a long time over many years. The fact that it is a concentrate means less visits to the store for purchase and you can get more laundry done.Two thumbs up!
Best for baby...forget DREFT and get this.Hypoallergenic, cleans and best part..you will never get an irritated skin or that super strong smell from leftover detergent.
this product works well. it does pay to shop around for this item. I have seen a lot of difference in price on this among the stores I shop at.
love this so little soap for such a big load of laundry its amazing and it doesnt make my sensitive skin break out
The price is amazing on this and not to mention its free and clear of all dyes and perfume!! I have an 8 month old and I love that she has no problems with it. I am using this for life!!
If you follow the measurements, you end up using less soap than other brands. It's a great value, and I've enjoyed using it.
A good buy and it's great for washing baby and kid clothes. It gets the stains out, is gentle on fabric, and doesn't leave any residue.
Very good laundry detergent. I must admit though I do miss not having any fresh clean fragrance. Perfect for those with allergies or sensitive skin.
I was very pleased to get this product at such a reasonable price. I take care of my elderly mother, so I wash a lot of clothes every day. The price of detergent in the supermarkets is totally outrageous. Thanks for helping me stick to my budget and keep Mom smelling fresh.
The All 2X Ultra Free Clear Liquid Laundry Detergent, works very well. It removes dirt, stains, and leaves clothes fresh and clean. The good part is that you do not have to use to much of it to wash a load of clothes.
USE THIS PRODUCT WITH KIDS THAT HAVE ECZEMA WORKS FOR US! ALSO THANKS TO WAL-MART FOR SHIPPING TO THE NORTHERN MARIANA ISLANDS. ROTA DONT CARRY THE PRODUCT!
I have not finished all the detergent yet, but I am happy with what I am seeing. Clothes are clean and fresh, and I do not have to use a lot of detergent .. I do have hard water.
I have been using All detergent for more than 20 yrs. Recently I decided to try these Pacs and I love them! I have an old fashioned top loading washer and I just start the water, toss in a Pac then the clothes and DONE! So easy and convenient - I don't have to lift a heavy jug and measure out the detergent. My husband does some laundry at the fire station and they have a front loading HE washer - he also uses the Pacs there. Just be sure to put the Pac into the drum of the washer, not the detergent cup, as it won't dissolve properly.
The small plastic pacs do not dissolve as described and leave a goo like mess on clothes, it does not matter what temperature you wash in as I have tried them all.
All Mighty pacs are great! I have tried other brands and they would leave a film on the clothes. What is really good about this product is that it saves money. I have two teenage boys who do the laundry and when it was the pour type that needed to be measured the boys would just pour what ever amount that thought the clothes needed. Now all they have to do is throw in one pac and clothes come out fresh and clean. Thank you for this fine product.
I bought these to take on the go when I stay away from home. They are easy to store and don't make a mess. I've just started using them at home also because they are just so easy you just throw one in with your clothes and they come out smelling fresh!! I do usually run in under water then bust only because I like to see the suds before I add my clothes.
This product actually is convenient and it works.
We like the pacs and will continue to use them. It is the same laundry detergent we have used for years but now we get a consistent measured amount. We like that the package is small and we don't have to deal with empty liquid containers.
Works great on baby clothes and don't have to spend a ton of money on special laundry detergent love it! Works great in HE machine also
Works great for what I needed. Holds my bottle of detergent, fabric softener, pre-treaters and dryer sheets. Also have room for my extra bottles on bottom shelf.
I use this product because we have a 2 year old with sensitive skin. So far no problems. I have one on the way and will continue to use this soap instead of baby detergent!
Really -NO- perfume. Not like, you get it home only to find that No Fragrance means Slightly Less Fragrance. I use a half cap in a top loader with warm water, good results. Also good for silks by hand. And for tile floors.
I'm allergic to all sorts of scents and chemicals and this is the only detergent I trust not to cause me areaction of some kind. The Walmart price isn't rock bottom if you really track the sales, but it's very good and with the unbelievably cheap shipping I think it's the best deal around -- especially because I don't have to lug all that detergent home.
Good product- It does not take a whole lot of soap for a load of laundry and I love the small bottle.
I love that it takes so little detergent to clean an entire load of wash.
For the money, your money: Easily the best and most concentrated laundry detergent.I love the easy to use spout, larger size, and superb cleaning ability of All HE Concentrated 3X Laundry Detergent.
This a good product and a way to save a few bucks
When I opened the box and cut open the top of the outer plastic bag enclosing the 11 bottles, I noticed there were no caps visible and the plastic bag was inches deep in liquid detergent. What a mess! I immediately took it to my local Walmart. They'd never seen anything like it. They discovered that all the caps had broken evenly in a circle above the seal and had sunk into the bottles! What a mess. I'm thinking it was the "expedited" shipping. It looked as if it had been in an unpressurized cargo hold to cause each bottle to have the identical damage done to it. Thank goodness for Walmart's excellent return policy!
I love this detergent! It was a great price, cleans clothes perfectly, and leaves the clothes with a delightful smell! Even my husband brought out a shirt that I had just washed and asked me to smell it and said, "doesn't that smell good?" Will definitely continue to buy!
Concentrated (3X) All, the Small & Mighty Stain Lifter Laundry Detergent is an excellent detergent. We have used concentrated All for almost 50 years . Now that we have a new front-loading washer, it is so wonderful to see that our favorite laundry detergent is also made in a "H"igh""E"fficiency version.
Been using All Small & Mighty for some time and really like it but it's getting hard to find in the stores that is why needed to order it on line. There used to be 4 different scents but now only "Fresh Rain" which wasn't the best. They even had one with bleach which i can't find anymore, go figure everything that is good they stop making.
I was a little disappointed when I received the Cascade via mail. The container was broken in many places- the product was loose in the bag it was shipped in. This could have been avoided.
I found this detergent slightly better than others, but not much.
Did not do a good job cleaning my dishes. Dishes still had food particle on dishes.
I would still love to find something cheaper, but until then...
I am not sure why, but this detergent leaves a horrible, white residue that is impossible to get off my dishes. I only used this detergent once in my dishwasher and refuse to use it again. I have been soaking and scrubbing the dishes I cleaned with this detergent for days. It is drying out my hands just from touching them. It feels like it stripped the dishes of whatever shiny coating they had before. I am not happy!
This is a great product. And a very good value. I used to use Tide but this product does just as good as the leading Tide. And smells great too.
I have used a lot of different laundry detergents. None beat Gain.I had washed some pillow cases and put up. Forgot about them and months later when I remembered them they smelled as fresh as the day they were washed.
Gain a powerful cleaning detergent. Regarding this particular scent, it is not that strong and has a light scent which is wonderful. The cleaning and removing stains that this detergent does is comparable to Tide. I am a heavy sweater and this scent has not disappointed me. Like Mango tango and Lavendar scents this Hawaiian scent is milder but just as powerful with Fabreeze. Will definitely stock up!! The only con I have is that I could not find the Fabric Refresher Hawaiian Aloha scent Softner:(
I purchased this product and a smaller bottle, the smaller bottle by accident because I thought it was fabric softner. It was a great deal, and being ill it makes it a lot easier to get the heavier things that I need without having to get someone to take me to the store. It had free shipping, so that was an added bonus, don't know if that's a regular thing or not, but it made it an even better value. Wouldn't hesitate to purchase from them again and have delivered to my house.
I am a huge fan of Gain and the price of this bottle is great. I wash like crazy, but I still have this bottle and my pockets are not hurting.
most people will love the scent and the febreeze fresh smell i forgot a load of cloths in washer for 4 days when away from home and they had begun to mildew i reran them with this product and they smelled great again
It smells extremely and get your clothes clean.
Great item and great smell.
I actually purchased this by accident, I love gain, it smells so good, and had puchased the largest size, thought this was the softner that went along with it. It was my error for not looking well enough to see what it was, however I will use it and it won't go to waste. It was still a great deal, and I was able to go back and find the softner in the sheets version and order them a few days later. I am never dissappointed with the way Gain works for me, but it's nice to find it at such a great price and free shipping really helps.
The best detergent for peoples who love the clothes very clean.
I absolutely LOVE this product! I have tried to save money by buying the off brand laundry detergent and it was a bad decision! My husband bought tide after complaining that the towels smell horrible still. Ever since then this is the only thing we buy now! It does everything thing it says! I no longer run my clothes through the washer twice thinking maybe that would work! THANK YOU TIDE!
I have tried many detergents, even other tide formulas and Tide with bleach alternative is the ONLY detergent that can get my messy twin 4 year old girls' clothes clean! If there is a spot that needs extra cleaning I just use pre-treat spray on that spot before the wash is started. Also, I always use the boost duo pacs in my wash. I've been using this detergent since my kids were babies without any issue. No irritation on their skin either. My husband is military and his clothes normally stink after work and are horribly stained, this tide takes care of that too. I can't wait to try out the pods, but I am going to get a small pack just in case and of course still use the spray for spot treatments.
I love my Tide because we own a towing/mechanic co. I cannot get my husband to wear coveralls, so his blue jeans are BLACK with grease at the end of the day. I am so confident with Tide I'll wait until I have a load. I get a small scrub brush use a small amount of tide and scrub the worst stains just to work the stain out, I also use the tide boost pacs. His jeans come out clean & fresh smelling. He brags about how clean his clothes are, and I get all the praise! Thank you for such a wonderful product. I've tried many other detergents high & low priced none of them work as well as My Tide.
SINCE I STARTED TO BUY TIDE " HE " THE MACHINE STOPED TO MAKE PROBLEMS. THE CLOTHES USE TO HAVE SUD, DIDNT HELP IF I USED A SMALL AMOUNT OF DETERGENT, I HAD ALWAYS PROBLEMS WITH THE RESIDUOS WHAT THE DETERGENT USE TO LEAVE.THE H E HELPS FOR THAT. NO MORE RINSING TIME AND TIME AGAIN MY CLOTHES. THANX TIDE FOR THE IMPRUVEMENT.
Tide is all I use and I use HE. It cleans my clothes using less and so in the long run it saves money and does a great job on our clothes.
I love using Tide, it cleans my husbands clothes as well as my kids clothes very well...I give it 5 stars even considering the price. If the company could find a way to make it even a little less, it would get like 10 stars! I LOVE MY Tide.
THIS IS ALSO A GREAT MULTI USE TIDE, GREAT FOR WHITEST WHITES SETTINGS. MY HUSBAND AND 14 YR,NIECE GET THIER SOCKS WELL FILTHY, THIS WITH A STAIN RELEASE PKT KEEP THEM SNOWY WHITE! I OWN A GREENHOUSE AND AT THE END OF THE DAY,I NEED DIRT HELP. ALSO GREAT FOR BEDDING AND KITCHEN TOWELS.. I HAVE MANY QUILTS THAT ARE HUNG THROUGHOUT HOUSE AND THIS PRODUCTS PERKS THEM RIGHT UP. I WOULD REC. TO ANY BODY THAT HAS A "BUSY"WASHING MACHINE.
Another reliable and great product from Tide - now made for HE machines! I bought it in the original scent, and while I use less - it still gets my clothes clean! I've had one shirt with multiple stains, which ALL came out! The only reason it loses a star is for the price - I do wish stores and P&G could find a way to lower the price!
I have tried several different HE detergents, but Tide cleans great, smells good and is worth the money, while some of the others stink and i have to use so much to make it clean, it's not worth it... Tide just works great!
I have been using Tide laundry detergent since my children have been little ones. They are now grown and also use Tide for their laundry. I use the one with a touch of Downy. Love it!!!
I have always used regular tide for many years. I now have a new washer and dryer and have changed to the Tide HE detergent. Am real satisfied with that too. However, I have always soaked my whites and want to continue to do so. But I don't know how to do this with this new machine.
cleans good for all clothes and good for he washers
Mountain Spring is my favorite and think it should be made in HE, please
I mean, really...it smells delicious...clean...easy...gets clothes clean...what's not to love about this product?
I am using tide from the last 3 years.I changed tide to tide HE because we bought a front load GE washer and dryer.I am so unhappy as my clothes are not stain free and my white clothes are not coming out white.Can somebody help me out with this .For full load do I have to pour max liquid?And what all other precautions I haev to take while doing laundry
I have been using this from the first day I purchased my HE washer and dryer and I will never use another detergent, even if it is cheaper. I have two young boys and they have brought some disgusting clothes in for the challenge. So far I am not disappointed. My husband is in the Army and his uniforms also have had some horrible stains and odors. I threw in a stain remover tablet with the Tide and they came out perfectly clean looking and smelling! way to go Tide!
Ive been unemployed for over 1 1/2 years therefore while looking for a job I've turned into a house husband takeing care of the house. This detergent was a no brainer and my wife couldnt belive how well I adjusted to doing the laundry and how clean the clothes stayed with a meer (lol) man doing the laundry.
Tide is the only detergent me and my whole family purchase. We have kids that love to get grass stains all over their clothes especially with them playing sports and i just spot treat it with my Tide and put it in the wash BOOM its gone!! Love the new scents my favorite is Clean Breeze and April Fresh. Buy it I promise you won't want to go back to any other. Awesome job Tide LOVE this product & keep on making it for HE!!!!!!!!
I always have a boatload of laundry with four young children plus my husband and myself. I have been using Tide for as long as I have been doing laundry, about 20 years. It works great to get out the dirt. I have been able to pass down clothes to the younger siblings because I have kept the clothes in great shape thanks to Tide.
Tide has been the only laundry detergent in our home since I was a child. I've been using it in my house for the past 40 years and I only use the traditional Tide...one change...now I use HE with my NEW front load washer. I love my washer and I really LOVE my TIDE! My children use it now for their families. Tide is part of the family!
My husband and I have been using tide for 24 years. A couple of years ago I purchased a HE washer. Love Tide's product for that. We love the fragrance free. Great product. Would not switch to anything else.
My mother never used a name brand detergent and as a child I remember thinking how good other peoples clothes smelled and how could I smell that good. I began using Tide when I moved out of my moms house because of the smell alone. I never knew I could love a detergent so much. :) But now that I am older I use Tide products not only for the smell but because I now have three boys of my own and I want them to feel good about their clothes. Tide takes out stains, keeps their clothes looking brand new ( and for boys that is a hard task ) and of course keeps them smelling fresh and clean all day. Thank you Tide from a loyal customer for life!!
I love the product but I hate the smell. I researched this site and see that you make a HE detergent with Febreze....which I love. My family calls me the Febreze Queen. However, I have a hard time finding the HE Tide brand with Febreze in my area. I also find the HE brand expensive but necessary because I have a HE machine and wouldn't use anything else. A loyal Tide customer. NEEDING THE FEBREZE SCENT!!!! :-)
smell it and stick nose in a cat litter box or at least if you own a cat you know this smell. well here it is in detergent, yucko just awful. i had to go out and get another detegent to rewash all the laundry i washed .and had to spend more money, this product i think still is the very best and very costly also, but if you can just change this awful smell ill buy it again and would refer a friend or 2 or 3.
My grandmother used Tide, as does my Mother, as do I. Its always been the best laundry detergent for as long as I can remember. Tide coming out with a high efficiency formula demonstrates that as usual, Tide is a step ahead of all of its competitors :D
I have learned how to use Tide HE and Tide Stain Release products with my new Electrolux front loading washer. I am happy to report that I have no problems removing stains (together they work better than bleach!), clothes look brighter/whiter and I can use these products on any fabric. The fragrance was very strong at first but I found that by adjusting the amount of Tide HE used or adding an extra rinse, the fragrance can be minimized. I have always trusted Tide products.
I've used tide for over 30 years and haven't found another brand that I prefer.
I just made the change to an HE washer and I love itI have been using the HE fabric softners and i did not notice it until yesterday when I bought a HE detergent to use my HE washer for the first time andI am loving the HE washer, the detergent and fabric softners. I love it!
SINCE THERE IS A NEED FOR LESS DETERGENT, I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE MEASUREMENT LINE MORE CLEARLY. PERHAPS A DIFFERENT COLOR CAP WOULD HELP. OTHERWISE, THE DETERGENT IS GREAT!
I recently (Approx. 6 months ago) switched over to the HE washer\dryer. Of course switching over to the 'HE' Tide, but to my dismay I could not find the Mountain Spring scent for the Tide HE. I love Tide and have used it for years, but I absolutely love the Mountain Spring scent!! Can you PLEASE make the Mountain Spring version for 'HE', your Original is good but I miss that 'so fresh and so clean' scent!!
I recently used Tide Total Care HE and was floored by the results. As soon as I took the clothes from the machine I immediately notice the dark colors seemed more vibrant. My favorite "odd color" red sweater looked almost new. Tide has given me results I've not seen before. The results were amazing. It's Tide Total Care HE from now on.
I have used Tide for years and recently bought a new Energy Efficient machine. I absolutely love the new Tide HE liquid. It takes such a small amount of detergent and my clothes are so clean. I have never been happier with Tide, or any other product for that matter.. I highly recommend Tide HE Liquid for the new Energy Efficient machine.
THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU. A year or so back I emailed with my disappointment on the new size of your dispenser bottle as it no longer fit in the cabinet above my washer. I had to refill another brand of detergents bottle with my Tide which was inconvient. Today as I walked down the aisle I saw the bottle seemed shorter so I bought one and IT FITS AGAIN.. This saves me from refilling bottles Thank you I appreciate less work even though I would not stop using Tide it has become more convient again.
I always use Tide--my favorite laundry detergent. My husband accidentally bought this. So problem # 1 is that the packaging does not make it obvious that you are not getting the Original ordinary Tide which is what I like. I used the stuff anyway because I was too lazy to take it back. It cleans just fine but I cannot stand the smell--I had to wash everything again to get it out and some of the "scent" is still lingering. Ick.
After using Tide w/Acti-Lift, our colored towels began fading. A sour odor was very prominent in the towels when used after showering, and the sour odor could be detected on our skin hours later. I changed brands, re-washed everything, and the towels are fresh & odor free. Is there an ingredient/chemical in the Acti-Lift that is causing this problem?
My mother always used Tide. I tried using other brands to save money, but they never got my clothes as clean and found that Tide is cheaper in the long run if you I want clean clothes. I now have a front loader and use the HE. The new actilift seems to get the stains out without pretreating the stains I normally would have pretreated, which is a plus as I often forgot about the stains to pretreat them.
I love the the green top (Mountain Breeze). Wishing you had that for the front loading washer. It makes everything smell awesome! Would give you 5 stars if you had that!
I had been using All HE and when I had gotten some stains on my white sheets I was so upset because I didn't think they'd come out. I washed them in bleach and All and 3 washes later the stains were still visible. We bought Tide HE and I washed my sheets yesterday morning with bleach and Tide HE, and poof! the stains were gone! Just goes to show you that it works wonders. This product is amazing!
I have a front loader so I have to buy the HE tide and I would love to see it available in all of the same scents as the regular. I would have definitely gave 5 stars if the HE was available in the mountain spring scent. Also I agree that you need to change the bottles so we can tell the difference between HE and regular because I myself have grabbed the regular and didn't realize my mistake until already using it.
I find Tide cleans the best of all the detergents I have tried. It cleans good and is one of the few detergents I have found with the HE ingridient..
Using your HE liquid in our new washer cleans well. My problem is when I hang out the wash, weather permitting, for the fresh sun shine smell, the clothes dry stiff. Why? Thanks, Ada.
I've always loved the smell of laundry hung outside. My grandmother was a strong Tide user, so I loved the smell Tide from the clothes line. We got ourselves a HE washer 4 years ago, and I went with the HE Powdered detergent. The smell brought back my child hood. When I ran out, I ran to the store to get some, and they were out. I had to go liquid stuff.. I thought, well give it a try. Did my next load, and when that came out of the washer, the scent was STRONG! Ughh.. I could not stand it. Even my partner mention the strong scent! I still got the bottle sitting on my shelf since I refuse to use it on my clothes. I"m back to the powdered stuff!
I love tide, its more expensive, but now i have an he washer theres not many choices in my area. REALLY..could we please do a different color? Who has time to look at your product making sure you have the correct stuff for your machine? I know what to get, but would he?? he would grab and go.
This soap is very concentrated be careful if you are the tyoe that doesn't really measure it out. You will end up with bubbles everywhere.
I have used Tide(HE), ALL(HE), Kirkland(HE)...... Belive me, Tide is the best, But it is most expensive than others.
OUR FAMILY IS A TIDE FAMILY AND HAS BEEN FOR MANY MANY YEARS. WE DO NOT HAVE A FRONT LOADING WASHER AND I GRABBED THE REGULAR ORANGE BOTTLE THAT I DO EVERY WEEK ONLY TO GET HOME AND DISCOVER THAT IT WAS A BOTTLE OF THE H.E. DETERGENT. I CAN'T USE THE H.E. DETERGENT IN MY REGULAR WASHER. I READ ANOTHER POST FROM A CONSUMER WHO DOES HAVE AN H.E. WASHING MACHINE AND GRABS REGULAR TIDE BY ACCIDENT. COME ON TIDE!!!! HELP US OUT HERE AND PUT THAT STUFF IN ANOTHER COLORED BOTTLE. THANK YOU!!!!!!
I love the different variations of Tide with the different fragrances and a 'Touch of Downey'...but am frustrated that most stores don't carry the matching Tide and Downy fragrances that I like. Where can I find the large Tide HE's (w/Bleach, w/Downey, w/Fabreze, etc.) and matching large Downey's?
All HE Tide products should come in another color than the original bottles. I can only use the HE products and mistakenly grab the wrong bottle almost every visit to the store. I see the HE bottle, but grab the wrong one since they are stocked consistently next to the original bottles. Help P & G and Tide. Change the bottles, why don't ya?
I just purchased my first front loading washer and dryer and needed to buy new detergent to go with it. I love the smell of Tide and it's always done a great job of getting my clothes clean. I bought the Tide HE 2X original scent. I love it. It leaves my clothes smelling good and clean. But when I did my first load of whites the blue soap turned some of my whites blue. All cotton materials were fine, but it was anything with spanex or stretchy material. Even the stitching on our socks are blue. I'm going to have to find something else to wash my whites with.
I buy Ultra Tide HE in the 170 oz bottle. I like that I don't have to buy it so often, saves money, and I really liked the spout for easy use. The first one was great, no leaks. I didn't like the residue in the measuring cup, but...minor. However, the second bottle leaks all over the place from where the white spout cap attaches to the bottle. I have tried tightening the cap, even standing the bottle upright, but still...leaks. Anybody have a solution?
When I got my new HE washer and dryer I got Tide HE as recommended and I liked everything about Tide HE except for the smell - I wasn't saving any water with having to use 2 or 3 extra rinses to get rid of the fragrance that clung even though with our soft water I can use much less than recommended - the smell fills the whole house and I really don't like walking around smelling like Tide. I've actually stopped using it until it becomes available in Unscented.
I like our new front loader and the Tide HE products with one exception. After a good gym workout, tee shirts don't seem to get clean enough. As a result, they develop a sour smell that appears when the shirts get damp either from rain or perspiration. Tide with bleach did a great job when we had a top loader. I hope that a bleach or bleach alternative product is in the works for front loaders.
I've been using Tide for over 40 years. I always get the Tide Free. With my new machines, I had to switch to the HE. I cannot stand the smell and it stays with you everywhere. I have migraine and it makes the smell unbearable. Please make an unscented version!
I bought this product, and my towels smell after using them once. I dont recommend it.
Love the Tide HE. Discovered it quite by accident and have been in love with it ever since. I was having problems with my regular Tide or any other detergent causing great amounts of suds in the front loader washer. I didn't even know they made the HE and picked it up by accident. First thing I noticed is that it didn't cause excessive sudsy which meant they machine didn't go thru several rinse cycles to get rid of all the foam. Haven't used anything else since. And everything is so clean looking and fresh smelling.
Tide HE works great. I have no issues with performance. My problem is that all the way to work this morning, I was assaulted by the strong scent of Tide HE. Why do you have to make it so fragrant? Fresh is fine but I do not want Tide to be my cologne!
I just recently got a HE washing machine, and my mom recommended the cheap stuff like Purex because the machine was not cheap at all. I used it, and disliked the wretched smell that it left on my clothes. I then saw Tide HE Powder in the store, and fell in love with the smell. I dont like the smell of the Liquid Tide, but the powder is phenominal, and my clothes smell wonderful, and I dont ever have to worry about finding a decent laundry detergent again! The Tide Creaters are genius
I tell you what this machine and tide together. Its wonderful! You save on your water bill. And your clothes get so clean and fresh. I just dont know what took them so long to make this... I love it....
As others have suggested, it would be great if there was more contrast in the cap color for easier measuring. Also, how about changing the shape of the bottle, make it shorter so it will fit upright in the pedestal drawer of a front load machine. I spent the big $$ to get the pedestals, and I'd sure love to store my detergent there. (I don't trust laying it on its side)
My new front loader has a drawer on the front that I have to pour the detergent into. I have always used the Tide with the faucet dispenser, so bought the 96-load Tide Ultra HE. Other reviews are right - using the cap to measure and pour was kind of messy - I managed to slosh the detergent all over the place. Almost immediately, I realized that I did not need the measuring cap. I hold the bottle by the handle, loosen the blue cap, hold the "faucet" over the detergent drawer, and dispense directly into the drawer, filling to the proper mark for the size load I'm doing. It allows for very precise dispensing, and the large bottle is surprisingly easy to hold, even when full. I store the bottle upright and have no dripping issues.
I have tried both of the Tide HE Powder and Liquid. I love the powder more, I was able to clean and do more loads than the Liquid. I didn't have an overwhelming smell, not like the liquid. With the Liquid I would put more than the required and still my clothes didn't feel or smell clean. My only problem now is finding a store that will sell the powder.
I am a new owner of a front-loading washer and the only detergent I've used is Tide liquid HE. In my last load, I found two orange spots on a polo shirt which had to have come from the detergent. I will probably finish the bottle but be careful about what I wash with it.
I hate the measuring cap. I find it very difficult to see the lines in the cap. It would be helpful if the measuring lines could be made a different color so the lines would be visible.
glad other people found the same problem after using Tide He. Since it uses less water to clean, the fragrance should be lessened by half
For those of you who use the detergent but hate the lid: try buying the large size tub with the push button dispenser. It lasts forever and then you can just toss the detergent cup into the wash and nothing is wasted.
my mom always used tide. i never bothered to ask why but as i went to my friends houses, i saw that they also used tide. it just seems to have the "perfect balance" effect on everyone. cleans clothes very well and doesnt leave a strong scent that often sticks to your clothes and gives a really bad head ache.
I like this detergent but I pour it into an All HE bottle just because I don't like this huge orange jug sitting around in my very nice laundry room. Occasionally I purchase the HE Free but still it is difficult to pour into my HE machine that is very tall.
I am a life long user of Tide products. Currently, I am very disapointed with the new shape of the 110 load 2X ultra Tide for front loaders with 170 fl oz, 1.32 gal. container. After pouring into my Bosh detergent dispenser drayer, I have to find some thing to wipe out the cap and to wipe the storage area on the container. Love the original scent, storage is ok, and hate the container and measuring cup.
Why is Tide HE made only in liquid form now? The powder packed in boxes is much easier to use as an older woman can dip it out instead of having to life a heavier bottle (jug) and pour into cup. Some "new and improved" packaging methods are not well thought out.
I love the product but the cap on the large size bottle leaks all over the place. I have tried to stand it up, lay it on its side but nothing works. I buy the largest to get the most for my money but the other caps work much better.
I LOVE Tide HE in the Original Scent. Nothing else on the market smells so good. It's not overpowering like most other detergents. Cleans everything, every time. My only gripe, and it has been since the day Tide HE came out, is that it is way too sudsy. Even with 4 rinses in my machine, there are still suds left. I wish P&G would reformulate the product to provide less suds!
I grew up with Tide. It was a staple in our household. At that time, it was the powder detergent. Now, in my household, we use Tide HE. I like that less product is used per load. Our clothes always come out smelling fresh and of course, clean (credit to HE washer, too). The scent is light and pleasant unlike some floral, overbearing detergents on the market. The cost is comparable to other brands.
I use this in my HE washer and i love the way my clothes come out. They are soft compared to another detergent and the smell good. Most of all, they stay in great shape wash after wash.
I find it nearly impossible to read how full the measuring cap is after its color was changed to dark blue, which coincidentally is almost the same color as the detergent. The product used to have a silver cap and I could easily see how much detergent I was using. I'm a born sceptic, so I tend to assume the worst, i.e. Tide changed the color of the top to increase product usage. Change it back to silver and all will be forgiven.
My sons play baseball and both wear white pants. Tide HE works wonders on the dirt, grass and Gatorade stains. The original scent is clean and fresh without being too flowery.
We bought a Frigidaire Affinity HE washer and dryer 6 months ago. Tide HE does an great job in getting clothes really clean in this machine. While it is a bit pricey, consider that the machines don't require a lot of detergent. We love our HE laundry pair, and we believe Tide HE the best choice.
I have tried other brands to try and "budget" so to speak, but no other brand than Tide will get ANY stain ( grease, the famous "red mud" of NC, ink, etc) out! My husband is an assistant Fire Marshal and has to go in burned buildings- the smell is pungent- Tide does the trick EVERY time!
I just recently purchased a new Samsung Silvercare Washer and have been using Tide ever since. I really enjoy the original scent over all the other scents that Tide makes. I used other brands of detergent in the past but none compare to Tide HE orginal scent! My washer gets my clothes the cleanest they have ever been. I don't know why I waited so long to get a High Efficiancy washer, they virtually use no water and they get your laundry three times as clean! I will use this scent of Tide as long as I do laundry, and that's a long time!
I love the smell of the original scent Tide, and I even use the Tide washing machine cleaner in my new LG HE washing machine. Tide is the only detergent that will be used in my washing machine. It cleans great and smells good, what more could a person want?
Tide is the only detergent I use! I have had a front load washer for many years now and I always use the HE. However, I have talked to many appliance techs (I'm in the appliance business) and was told to use powder.
I also own a front loader-Whirlpool DUET. I have been using TIDE HE for two years. I LOVE the way it makes my clothes smell. It brings back memories of childhood, TIDE was all my mother used. But the TIDE HE with bleach is hard to find where I shop, wish I could find that one also.
I just got a front loader machine and I use the tide with bleach. Love the scent makes my clothes smell so good. Will use it from now on
I have been using a High Effeciency combo washer/dryer for 6 years now and would use nothing but Tide for my laundry needs. My only problem is that the powder version of this product keeps getting harder to find. Due to the design of the detergent fill drawer liquid causes oversplash while the machine fills. So powder really does a superior job. Can you help me find out who in the Charleston area is going to continue carrying the powder HE detergent?
I have found that the powder HE works best in my front loader Maytag. However, lately have been unable to find the powder product and wonder why the store indicates DISCONTINUE. Does anyone else have this problem. Will continue using TIDE in some form.
I had been using the powdered TIDE HE, but recently had to buy the liquid with original scent. The fragrance was strong and irritated both my husband's and my eyes during a load of wash (the washing machine is in the kitchen area). The dried clothes still had the perfume smell which I personally find offensive. I would really like the product without any fragrance.
Cleaning = 4 stars. The scent--I kept asking "did they put enough for an entire truck load in just this one bottle?" Overpowering. I mean, doing laundry shouldn't make your entire entire house reek. I could smell it on clothes outside is a stiff wind. Like cheap perfume. Bought the big 110 load bottle. After 3 loads, I donated it to a shelter because I couldn't stand the stench.
we like the he products,however i have a very sensitive skin family that reacts to about everything and i need the tide he to be unscented or the original scent. i can only find the scented products. we are either allergic to or cannot take the scent.
I agree with EconomyBuyer here in Memphis, TN. Tide needs to come out with a variety scents. The original is not a strong fresh smell like I would want. However, I do trust that Tide cleans well.
I have tried a few times to buy the "on sale" brand to save a buck or two ... and boy was I sorry, each time! Everyone in my family, husband and kids, notice the difference right away! My husband even says the other brands make him itch ... but NOT our TIDE! No more "other" brands for us .. ONLY TIDE!!
I bought my HE washer with smart dispence 6 months ago. I have used Tide only for years. There was no doubt Tide HE was going into the new machine. It works great! My clothes still look great.
This product does work great on cleaning my clothes; however, I have never been a fan of the original scent and that is all I can ever find in the stores. Tide needs to offer more scents and variety in the HE formulas!
I bought my HE washer a year ago and have used nothing by Tide HE in the washer since. I love it! It works great on stains and my clothes look great.
Since purchasing my HE washer, this is the only detergent I would consider purchasing. Cleans great and is a trusted brand.
I am a long time tide user,before they had liquid. It's a tried and true laundry soap that keeps all my clothes, and fine or heavy laundry clean and fresh smelling. I love being able to order on line shipped free to my home :)
I have been using Tide for many years, and then when Tide with Bleach came on the market, this product is the best for white clothes. I soaked my whites overnight in Tide with bleach and wash the next morning, followed by rinsing and washing again with Tide with Downy or Tide with Febreze.....the best, your whites are whiter than white. I have also recommended to friends and coworkers when they complimented me on my white clothing
I submitted a review about Tide liquid last year when it first came out with Acti Lift. I did not like the smell of the new formula and switched to another detergent. I recently decided to give Tide another try when it came with the MY TIDE labels on the caps. I am so glad I did. I can tell P&G addressed the problem with the smell. I love the scent again and this Tide cleans better than ever.I am a loyal Tide user again. Thanks for listening.
I have been using tide products for years every time I try to use any other products the stains do not come out and my whites are no longer white so I have always returned to using my favorite tide its the best on the market.
I am a RN and use Tide with Bleach Alternative on my scrubs that I wear for work. While in nursing school people would comment on how white my uniforms were and would ask me what detergent I used. But recently I used Tide with Bleach Alternative on two different regular loads of laundry. Clothes in BOTH loads came out with BLEACH SPOTS. I am fully aware that "Tide with bleach alternative does not contain chlorine bleach and may actually help to neutralize the water..." But the reality is, my clothes have BLEACH SPOTS on them. Two different loads! I have never used chlorine bleach in our washer before (its 2 months old) so there is no other explanation as to why my clothes are ruined other than the laundry detergent. Please do not reply with your standard response that you "will let the rest of the Tide team know about my problem"...its almost insulting.I will continue to use Tide with Bleach Alternative on my work uniforms, as it has always worked great for me. But never again will I use it on regular laundry because it is not so color safe after all.
My daughter is always playing with something that will stain her clothes no other detergent has been able to get rid of the stains besides TIDE I love it....smells so fresh and leaves my clothes Like new again!
I absolutely love liquid Tide with Bleach. I will not use another product for my laundry. I do have one slight problem, I only like the original scent and it is becoming more and more difficult to find! The other scents are too strong and, in my view, they are too overpowering.Sincerely,Lora
I love tide with bleach alternative, I used to use tide liquid, then switched to tide bleach alternative,I know when I put my soiled or stained clothes in the washer they are going to come out clean!!!my daughter spilled some chocolate syrup on her shirt the other day,and simply said "that's ok, just put some tide on it"....enough said........only problem I have been finding......it's hard to find in the large containers.........
I bought the Tide With Bleach Alternative in the powder form and I stopped using it only after a few washes. I could not stand the smell of my clothes after I used it. It's hard to describe the smell other than it smelled bitter or harsh smelling. I always considered Tide a high quality detergent but I'm very disappointed on how my clothes smelled after using it.
My handicapped son made a huge mess with fruit juice in the middle of my large family room beige carpet that no carpet shampoo seemed to touch. A friend that owns rental property told me to try Tide with Bleach Alternative in my hot water carpet cleaning machine as one last try before I ripped up the carpet. She swears by it being the best thing ever so I tried it. She suggested that on really soild stains that didn't come up to add some color safe liquid bleach with the Tide if it didn't come up the first time. I put Tide in my Rug Doctor with water just like normal carpet shampoo. It saved 900 sq ft of carpet plus a matching carpeted stairway. I would strongly suggest trying a very small spot in the corner on colored carpets as you don't know if it would fade carpet fibers, but on an eggshell/beige it works wonders. We laid a small scrap we had saved for any minor repairs on it and color was still exact. I now keep a pump spray bottle loaded with Tide and water in the utility room for fast responses. Spray spots and dab to soak up with towels.Thanks Tide!
My daughter is 3yrs old and makes messes and has accidents, plays hard. This detergent takes the worry out of accidents or messes. This allows me less time worrying about her clothes and more time with her.
I have used Tide for more years than I want to admit, I LOVE IT!! We wouldn't use anything else. I love the way it cleans and smells.
I usually use this product on everything, however, it doesn't work like it use to. Use to, I could get anything out, now... not so much.
I too have used this product for awhile but have ruined a few clothes due to white spots on our colored shirts. It seems to be bleach spots. We finally figured it out since by son went to college and started doing his own laundry using a different product. I was embarrased that I ruined his shirts when he came home and not him!!! Don't know whats in it but it does causes bleach spots on certain shirts, especially ones with spandex in them.
I used another detergent for years, but started reading Consumer Reports and bought according to their recommendations a year or so ago. White towels that came out sparkling previously are now showing more and more dirt -- same towels, same dirt source. Not happy. And not sure anything will get that dirt out now.
I have used tide w/ bleach years and have always loved the product. Now, I cannot find tide with bleach in ORIGINAL scent anywhere! I can't stand the scents that it comes in, and can only find the tide w/ blech in original scent for HE washers..I have an old school top loader...I think I may have to find a new brand :(
I haven't used this yet because I'm so nervous to wash my colors since it has bleach in it. I accidently bought this kind but it says "color safe". Has anyone had any trouble washing colors?
The cleaning aspects of the mountain spring tide plus bleach are OK. But the smell is not. If you are like me and like to use detergents with bleach.. stick to the other scents.
I love the fresh smell of Tide with Bleach Alternative Orginal scent...the added Bleach just gets the clothes that much cleaner and brighter without fading the color...I just love it!!!!
Used this product for years. My sons think there's something wrong if their clothes don't "smell right". They have to have the Tide smell. With 2 sons, and a husband that can really get dirty and sweaty, this works really well.
i have used tide with bleach alternative for 15 years and i have NEVER found anything better . i have tryed the other laundry detergent's and NONE add up to tide.i do wish though that tide would start making the original with bleach alt. in a 98 load liquid again its easier than a powder. im still NOT gonna use another name.PLEASE it works well with downy fabric softener ORIGINAL. thank you
Wonderful product. Would love it more if Tide Plus with Acti-Lift came in original scent for regular washers @ the 100 plus dispenser. I don't have HE washer.
Tide w/bleach alternative is safe to use on my colors, but strong enough to get out the toughest stains on rought clothes from my son and husband! I will never switch from Tide! It's the best!!!!!
I never use anything but Tide with Bleach!! Love this product...
I love using Tide with bleach alternative because it really keeps my colors brights and my white clothes extremely white and it also fights toughs stains. My fiance gets his uniforms extremely dirty and smelly every day I never have to worry about the stains because I use Tide with bleach alternative.
I have been using Tide for awhile now and never had a problem until recently I washed my towels with Tide "color safe bleach" and it ruined my tan and brown towels they have bleach spots all over them!!!!
I have been using Tide for many years, and have been very satisfied with the product. Believe it or not, I get compliments on my laundry. The whites come out white and the colors stay bright never faded looking. I was upset when the tide with bleach was changed to tide with bleach alternative, but , it is just as good.
This product works wonders on messy clothes. Having two children that are talented at making messes, this detergent really takes out the stains and leaves the clothes looking and smelling wonderful. Thanks Tide.
I have used other Tide with Bleach products for years with never a single complaint. This is the first time I have used the Tide with Bleach Alternative Liquid Laundry Detergent. It ruined my new pants! There are bleach spotches all over my pants! I cannot possibly wear them again.
My family has always used Tide it is the number one with us. We dont like changing when some is really good. We only change the different kinds but not the brand Tide. It fights dirt and really worksw.
Being a busy student and working full time as a Nurse I can always depend on Tide with Bleach Alternative Liquid to get those stains out, and my uniforms and everyday cloths look great the first time around, unlike some of the other products out there. I have been using Tide for over 15 years now, but Tide with Bleach Alternative Liquid is the best. Since I have an HP Washer, it has the low suds and for the rinse I use just a little of the Tide Fabric Softener and my wash comes out bright and smells good too. I recommend Tide to all my friends as well as you.
Tide with Bleach keeps all my white clothes looking great - it works good for colored clothes, too! Couldn't do without it!!
I have been using Tide with Bleach Alternative Liquid for several years and love it.My husbands' work clothes always look clean and smell good. I love the way my office clothing looks after washing with this.I often pretreat spots with the liquid the day that any stain is found. For the most part, I never have problems getting the stain out.
I have a daughter that has white uniforme shirts. And this is the only thing that i use to help keep them white
In the non-bias, non profit company, Consumer Reports. They rated Tide 2X Ultra with Color Clean Bleach Alternative #1 in the ratings of laundry detergents! I use it and love it myself!
I like that I don't have to use color safe bleach in addition to a detergent. Thanks for creating this great combination. Get everything clean without fading. Thank you Tide!
I love this Tide! Any time I've tried to use a cheeper brand I always go back to it. Its the only product I've found that gets my husbands BDU's clean and his hospital scrubs good as new!
I would have put excellant, but the price is my only issue...I have worked for the appliance industry for over 10 years, and in those 10 years, I have been asked to use 100's of types of detergants...and NOTHING comes close to getting my clothes ACTUALLY CLEAN than TIDE!!!The other detergants may smell nice...but nothing smells better, and more importantly get's my clothes CLEANER...NO ONE!!!The only issue with Tide, is the price...but you get what you pay for...and to keep clothes looking newer, this is the only one I buy. It may kill me to do so (and yes lately I have had to purchase cheaper brands - WHICH I HATE, but because I am currently unemployed, but I do it with coupons as often as I can...Thank you,Bridget E.
When I went to make my Tide with Bleach purchase the shelves were empty. Instead of buying any other type of laundry soap I wait till I can get what really CLEANS my clothes. And yes it IS colorsafe! I wait till I find Tide with Bleach in stock!
I have used Tide with Bleach Alternative on ALL of my clothes for many years. It is absolutely the best cleaner I have ever found, It cleans and brightens all of my clothes and I have NEVER in thousands of washes, EVER had bleach stains or issues with this product. I HIGHLY recommend it for anyone that would like to have the cleanest, freshest clothes around!
My father passed away 2 years ago. Recently I received his bath robe. I used Tide with bleach alternative COLOR SAFE. Well,it was not. A large bleach blotch. is on the front of it now. Do not use this product if you care about your garment.
Although the non HE is getting very difficult to find, it is by far the greatest product around. The smell permeates my entire house and people ask me what I use to clean. I wish I could find a candle to have that smell always. My husband works in the oil industry and occasionally comes home with some pretty tough laundry, but this product has never let me down. I have been a devoted customer for 18 years and counting!! Thanks and keep up the great work!
I really love this product. It saves me from having to buy bleach with the way the economy is today. I use this product all the time.
I have used this product since it was introduced. The scent is very light and I am unable to tolerate the strong scent of bleach. This is and has been a wonderful alternative. It has become almost impossible to locate the Tide w/bleach, Clean Breeze in our area. I would appreciate knowing where to go to purchase this. Keep this product, all of my family switched to this and is used alot.
I have always used Tide and LOVE the scent. I use it to wash my clothing, but have also used it for years to clean stains from my carpet, and vehicle upholstry. Lately, with money being tight, I decided this was a product I did not NEED but rather preferred. I bought another brand of detergent.While I was painting in my kitchen, I tipped the paint tray over and got Red latex paint all over our white carpeting. I went to the laundry room and grabbed the Purex Natural Elements I had purchased, and went to work attempting to remove the stain. It wasn't long before I decided it would not do the trick, and that I needed Tide. I ran to the store, picked up my Tide...and it took the stain right out....AMAZING product...will never try another brand again.
I used this product once prior and that was about this time last year. I had no problem with it. All my clothes came out smelling clean and looking clean. And that was even washing in cold water.
For many years I used the predecessor, liquid Tide with Bleach Alternative as a spotting agent before washing with powdered Tide Free. It WAS the BEST spotting agent on the market (though not marketed as such), good on colors, etc.The formula in the new 2X version is DIFFERENT! When used on spots, it causes color to bleach out around the spot - even when I dilute it 50/50 with water to try to recreate the older, less concentrated product.Unfortunately, I am stuck with a huge 100 oz bottle of the stuff. If I had known the formula would change when 2X came out, I would have bought a lifetime supply of the old formula.In general, I do not like the 2X concept. Normally I use about HALF of the recommended amount of detergent so that it will rinse out completely. Now, with a smaller measuring cap, it is harder to determine HALF and its too easy to get more detergent than desired.BRING BACK the ORIGINAL TIDE with Bleach Alternative!
I love the Tide with bleach alternative. My husband and I are very sensitive to scents and we love the original scent Tide. The problem is that I cannot find it anywhere!!! I can only find this solution in small bottles which are not very economical. I know this detergent comes in larger, more economical amounts but everywhere I seem to go only carries it in the clean breeze or mountain spring scents.
I bought this product because I always use color-safe bleach along with my detergent and thought this would be an easy way to get both. I liked the product at first, but have now noticed that many of my colors are coming out ruined! They have faded spots and completely bleached spots. I have ruined many clothes and towels using this detergent and will tell everyone one I know to BEWARE! I have only been married 2 years and now I have to replace most of the towels that we received for wedding gifts because I used this! I also have many of mine and my husbands shirts and jeans that we cannot wear anymore. I won't buy Tide products in the future and suggest that you watch out with using this product.
I have always used Tide products and have loved the results....until using this product. I have ruined many garments....including quite a few valuable ones....using this product. It leaves random bleached spots on several pieces of clothing within each load. It actually me several loads to figure out that it was the Tide. I will never buy this product again. I am very disappointed and surprised that this product was not more thoroughly tested before marketing. I ruined an expensive couch slipcover and my son ruined many of his new school clothes purchases since he likes to wash them once before wearing them. I feel that Tide should give me some compensation!!!!
I have tried all the detergents that are know to man kind. I have found Tide to be the best with stain removal and freshness. I work in a coloring store so I take very good care of my clothes. I tell everyone that I come in contact with (even people I dont know in the markets) to buy TIDE. Its the only way to go by far. Everyone should be buying this product b/c you get the most for your money!!!!!!!!!
I too have experienced the leakage of the new designed bottles. The product is great, but you lose to much detergent. Tide is not an inexpensive product, therefore, your company should look into the leaking problem.
My steering wheel has an old covering on it and black rubber from the wheel shows through. I got into the car with a white skirt suit and my leg rubbed against the wheel causing two sets of black streaks on my skirt. This happened over a year ago and I didn't wash/pretreat the skirt because I thought I could never wear it again. I went online yesterday and saw a recommendation for Tide with Bleach for stain removal. I soaked the suit for 40 min and I washed it on the delicate cycle. I had to scrub it a little bit to release the stain, and then I washed it again. You would have to use a magnifying glass to find where the streaks were. I'm very impressed with the results.
I grew up with Tide as the only degergent my Mother would use. I used another with bleach alternative for years on my colors. This winter I found Tide with bleach alternative as I was washing clothes 2 hours after my husband wore them due to spills. He was in a Halo and spilled everything. Tide not only removed the stains, but renewed the color. They seem to be taking on a faded look from the degergent I had been using.Thanks Tide!
I love Tide! I was a loyal Tide buyer until we had a baby and doind so much laundry I thought I would save money and buy cheaper brands. I ended up doing twice as much laundry b/c I had to double wash each load. Our son is 2 now and very rough on clothes. Tide with bleach alternative does the job every time. I have had no problems with leaks from the big container that sits on its side and no funny after smells either. Just clean fresh clothes!
I have purchased tide with out and with bleach alt and am finding the same issues with the large bottles I never used to have a problem with them but the new concentraated tide bottles all leak!!! I have lost at least 20 loads of soap it is no longer a bargain to buy the large bottles and we do laundry for 6
I have been a loyal TIDE user for my entire life, so when we bought a high-efficiency frontloading w/d combo, naturally I went straight to TIDE. We've tried both formulas, He2 and this one w/ ultra bleach alternative. Both SMELL. No matter what we do, there is a residual "unclean" smell that is left behind by these two formulas. The only way we can remove it from our clothes is when we change laundry detergents. I am heartbroken as I have always been faithful to TIDE. But sorry guys, this formula stinks. Literally. My whole family complains about it.
I have been a loyal Tide user for many, many years. However, I hate the new design of the large bottle. It fits on my shelf well and I love the feature of the dispenser, but it leaks so I can't keep it on it's side. I had hoped it was a fluke, but every bottle I have purchased has the same problem. It's cumbersome to not be able to use it how it was designed. Please look at the design flaws of this bottle. I've had friends say the same thing.
I have two children, my daughter is 3 and my some is 17 months old (for now). My son is an extremely dirty eater and my daughter is not afraid to get dirty outside, so needless to say, their clothes can be a challenge to clean. I tried Tide with Bleach Alternative for a quick load of mixed laundry, colors and whites, hoping for just some presentable clothes for my kids to play in, but I was pleasantly surprised when everything came out spotless! Not only that, they smelled fantastic too. Now I use Tide with Bleach Alternative for all my laundry. Thanks Tide!
Normally I don't write reviews for products, but I'm making an exception in this case. I tried almost every product out there over the last 15 years. I wanted to save money, so I tried the "bargain" brands. Needless to say, they were no bargain. I had to rewash all my clothes at least one or two times to get them clean. After only one use of Tide I realized I wasn't saving money with the other brands at all. Tide not only saves me money, it saves me time as well, I don't have to spend all day rewashing clothes.The only problem I have is that you no longer offer the huge bottles of liquid detergent that you use to have.
First off the price through walmart is the best out there and the product itself is fantastic! Great clean fresh scent. When we have house guests stay overnight, they always comment on the sent of the sheets and towels (gotta love tide) we also use the bouce sheets in the dryer. Tide also gets stains out really well-clothes always look super clean!
Great product, a bit expensive.
Was afraid that Walmart didn't send the correct detergent as "He" sticker was on the back of the bottles. Not the cheapest detergent out there, but the best.
Tide is always on the top of my list for laundry products. The clothes get clean and since this is HE it does not take much. Nice size for the price.
Makes my laundry smell freshly laundered when I sniff my laundry.
I think I am a NEW tide customer. I know family members who have used it but now I am a believer. Thanks
I will never use any other detergent other than tide. A little goes along way. Somtimes when I try to get cheap and buy other watered down detergents I would have to re-wash them all over again. With tide it is just one capfull and it is done. The clothes comes out cleaner and the whites whiter.
My Mother used Tide. My sisters and I now use Tide and we love it...I remember my Mother having the whitest wash on the clotheslines in our back yard. Clotheslines we could use more of.
I have been laid off for quite awhile now and decided to change to another detergent which was cheaper to save money. The results were not good. I was not satisfied with the results of the other product and decided I had to have my Tide. I KNOW what I'm going to get using Tide!
Not sure why they came out with Cold Water Tide. I have been using Regular Tide in cold water for at lest 35 years and it always works great. No need to spend extra money for tide cold water.
I've tried them all... I was talking with my husband one day and told him not to buy the generic laundry detergent only buy Tide. You use less and it does a better job. So he did. Later he showed me a baseball cap we were trying to get stains out of and said "the Tide got it all out". Then added... why does anyone buy anything else? My point exactly!
I have always had a top type washer I now have a front loader and since i was little my mom always used tide(powder) i felt that was doing the job but I now have a front loader and using that new tide product is wonderful"" tell any friend you have spend the money your clothes will love it.
tide cleans my clothes better then any other free and clear detergent just wish they had mor ecoupons
The 2X formula is great, same great cleaning power but with less product to use as well as bottle taking less space to store thus can more in shelf at home and stores. Less to recycle and also being biogradable is great.
I just had to let you know what the new Tide laundry detergent for front loading machines is awesome. I have a Maytag washer (later recalled, too late for me) that has mold which nothing removes and has a foul odor from water laying in the tub base. Our clothes always stink. Until now!! Our laundry no longer smells and when we open the washer, we don't have to hold our breath. I'm going to let everyone know. Thanks!
I love using Tide. My mom always used and when I went out on my own I used and still use it 9 years later. I don't have to use a pre treater. I pour a little TIde right on the stain and then scrub it together and then let it sit for an hour or so. I wash it and the stain is gone.I love Touch of Downy
I love that I can buy these types of items on Walmart.com. Will be coming back often to replenish.
I would not use any other product. I have been using this ever since I can remember
I only use this brand of Tide, it does everything I need for the clothes I wash. I have 4 grandchildren, my husband & myself, (almost forgot the dogs clothes & beds). This gets all the stains out like grass, mud, and whatever the boys get into. It does a good job on my husbands rags for the garage too. I do hope the Pods come in the original scent as I am very sensitive to smells. I don't like any smell but Tide HE w/Bleach is great for this household.
My two daughters ages 6 and 9 go to a Catholic School that requires them to wear a white shirt as part of their uniforms. I use this detergent to wash their shirts and they always come out nice and bright. By the end of the year their shirts look just as white as when I bought them.
I use Tide HE and have tried many of the different types (bleach alternative, febreze, etc) and I love them all! They smell great and the stain fighting power is awesome considering I have 2 messy girls. I would recommend Tide to anyone who hasn't tried it yet.
Tide with Bleach Alternative has lifted and eliminated almost EVERY SINGLE stain from the clothes of a 7 year old boy and a 9 year old girl. Chocolate, dirt, juice, ice cream, and even blood (yikes!) are no match for Tide. Not to mention a husband who golfs and ends up with grass stains on his socks and slacks! Bring it, Tide.
have used cheap & expensive brands, im pretty fickle that way. but i have never been so happy with a detergent as i have been with Tide HE, bleach alternative
Just purchased new HE washer, been using this product for a couple of weeks. Odor lingers on clothes (and in laundry room) and is overwhelming, even using less detergent, an extra rinse & fabric softener. Previously used TIDE w/BA "Clean Breeze". It appears "Clean Breeze" or fragrance free is not available in this formula. Will change detergents before this container is empty.
I have been a tide customer for over 7yrs and i love it the cleanliness and smell are just amazing i would and could use any other thing THANKS TIDE!!!!!!
I have used Tide for years and I am so thankful for the poduct. I love the bleach alternative; thanks for making a great product.CLHunt~
I had a good experience with teh product and would suggest this for others too.
My overall feeling is that I simply coudn't ask for a better smelling detergent. Personally I'd rather smell like fresh laundry than perfume. Weird I'm sure, but maybe it just brings me back to the memories of doing laundry with mom.
Good review from Consumer Reports and appears to me to do a good job of cleaning, but what good is a detergent if the scent is so overpowering that you can't use it? When I use this detergent, my cloths smell like I sprayed them with bathroom deodorizer. If you sweat or get them wet, the scent gets even stronger. I'm returning my bottle.
I have just purchased a front loader washer and dryer. The tide with bleach cleans my clothes very well compared to other products. I think alittle goes a long way. I think that the HE products should be displayed in a green color since we use less product then the regular detergent. The color represents going green. Perhaps, tide should consider changing the HE product color for a easier find for the consumer. It will make the customer purchase in the store easier. Please consider.Thanks again.
I have been using Tide with Bleach HE for four years since first purchasing my front loading washer. Always loved how well it cleaned the clothes and loved the way it smelled. Since Tide started putting the Acti Lift into the detergent the smell is very strong and bitter. I do not like the way my clothes, sheets and towels smell.I have been using the original scent so I tried the clean breeze. Did not like that either. Also overwhelming scent. Please Tide, go back to the original pleasing scent.
I love this product! I washed clothes that I used to consider " play clothes" with this detergent, and guess what, They are as good as new ! I only wish that they also offered this in an HE powder form also.
I think this product is excellent for taking stains out. Just pour a small amount on stained item (do not add any water) and let it sit for 24 hours. There is no need to scrub it. Then throw it in the washing machine and the stain will disappear !
I was so excited to try this because all I've ever used in the wash was regular Tide HE detergent. It's not necessarily a terrible buy, and my dad's undershirts are very white now, but it's not great at getting out simple stains.
I have never used a product that would take out blood stains that were set into the fabric for over two weeks. My elderly mom recently fell and had to go to rehab. With the hospital and rehab a distance away I wasn't able to get her laundry done until she came home. I looked at the stain and thought I would have to soak it over night. But, with just one wash it was just like new! Bravo!
Tide is the detergent out there!I just purchased a HE washer & am looking forward to using Tide HE
I thought the product was very useful and compared to other comparable items, I would recommend this one over them
I've been a loyal Tide user for 42+ years, I used to use the powder version, but recently purchased a front loading washer and dryer and started using the liquid HE with bleach alternative product exclusively for all my loads. I noticed that my clothes seemed to be looking "dirty". I couldn't figure it out at first, but then noticed that my whites were actually a bluish color which explained the colors of my other clothes. There is simply too much blue dye in this product.Other than that, it's a great product. I now only use it on my darks like jeans.
I have been using this product for several months now, and am more than satisfied with it. It gets out any and all kinds of stains, and keeps my colors looking bright. I highly recommend it.
This may not blast some stains away on the first wash, but it does a great job if you know what you're doing. This will get out just about anything with a pretreat or presoak. Don't have time? Then wash with this and hang in the sun to dry. Stain will be gone. I Use this for are severely stained articles. Hasn't let me down yet.
I am so dissappointed in this product it doesn't get even the most basic dirt out, my clothes look like I didn't wash them at all. Even worse they smell bad now. I've been happy with every other Tide product I've used but this one was a waste of money.
Hey all, P&G Stopped making tide in the UK (where i'm from) so every 3 months i travel to New York and purchase my favourite brand of washing detergent. I love Tide so much i really need P&G to sell Tide in the UK again (Maybe just London) Keep up the good work.God Bless
This has removed old fruit stains from t-shirts I had discarded as too stained to wear anywhere.
Just purchased a front-loading washer and was pleased to find my favorite "Tide w/Bleach Alternative" is available in the required HE version (been using Tide forever, LOVE the way my clothing smells, so I couldn't imagine changing). Clothes are clean but the scent is bitter & intolerable (not at all like the powder). Will have to switch to unscented/different brand :(
This is good, not great, on my whites. It's not quite strong enough to get them as white as the results I got using Tide powder with Bleach when I had a traditional washer. Unfortunately, I haven't been able to find another HE detergent which cleans whites as well as this one. Tide, please, please give us an HE powder formula with Bleach.
This Tide is great without a overwhelming scent. My clothes are whiter and brighter than anything I have ever used. I do not think I will use any other product. BRAVO Tide. Thanks for making the best laundry products ever. I can't wait to try your new stain remover products. GO TIDE.
i realy like this product but it has some much smell to this product that i am not able to wear any colonge or other products because the smell of this product is too strong. it works good and i enjoy using it. please give us a softer scent. thank you for this product for the washing machine that i use. a nickname should not be require to sent this e -mail to you. not everyone has one. I only use my given name. the name i was give is Joyce.
I loved this product when I was buying it for our old washing machine. When we had to purchase a new machine we went with an HE machine. I was excited to see that Tide with Bleach was available for HE machines and bought some. WOW. I have never been so completely overwhelmed by a scent in my life. It is terribly strong. I am no longer able to work in my home office next to the laundry. It gives me bad headaches, and makes it impossible to concentrate!I am very disappointed! Please Tide! Please offer this product in a mild scent!!!The Method detergents smell great, but I need the cleaning power of Tide with Bleach.
I'm having problems with allergic reactions to the Tide HE. I previously used Tide Free for sensitive skin, but it doesn't come HE and I have a new front loader machine.
Let's face it, sometimes I'm a bit messier than I like to admit. But Tide gets my clothes clean (dirt on my pant legs from getting in/out of car, stinky gym clothes) without fading the color. The only thing worse than a black sweater with a stain on it, is a grey sweater that used to be black! Thanks Tide!!
Best price on heavy Tide, delivered to my door, shipped free! Do you really need to think much about this!!! I'm recommending it to all my friends!
Tide just gets things cleaner than the other brands i've tried.
Great long lasting scent on clothing even after i unpack it from my drawers, but not an overpowering smell. Cleans really well also. Definitely plan on purchasing again.
Tide plus a Touch of Downy (April Fresh) liquid detergent is the only one I'll use. It saves me from having to add Downy to the rinse water. Plus, our clothes come out smelling wonderful when paired with an April Fresh dryer sheet. Soooooo nice!
I always try to use tide, it is easy for me shop on line when I do not have time to get to the store.
I love Tide with a touch of Downy lavender scent. It makes our clothes smell so good! My 7 yr old will not wear clothes washed in anything else. My mother washed some of my daughters clothes at her house thinking to help me out , but when we got home my daughter said "Mommy you have to wash these they don't smell right!" My mom uses Tide too just not the scent that I use. She uses Mountain Fresh Tide and my brother uses the unscented one!!! We're a whole family of Tide users!!!
These new scents are too over-powering to me so I don't buy them. However, I used to buy Tide Simple Pleasures Lavender/Vanilla all the time and used it to wash my sheets and towels. I still miss it terribly. I will never get used to this new scent. I don't understand the point. Why go and change a good thing?
I have been getting blue stains in the last few months which I assumed were a result of direct contact with the detergent. I started filling the machine with water to mix up the detergent since I didn't want to switch (the lavender scent is delicious!) but I'm still getting the stains. This morning I looked it up and it seems to be because of the mix of detergent and fabric softner. I will have to switch to the regular Tide detergent, I just wish they made it in this scent!
I typically buy a different brand detergent but i decided to give Tide/downy a try and i simply regret it. I spent a good amount of money buying clothes for a new job a just got and Tide pretty much ruined most of my shirts. I used the product above mentioned and now my shirts have some orange dots in random places. It looks as if i had tomato sauce splatter over the shirts. Very dissapointed. I wonder if PG would pay for the damages??
I was raised with my mother using Tide so when I grew up I used Tide and Downy myself. When you decided to add them together you made my day! I've convinced several friends to use Tide - it works better than the cheaper laundry detergents and is one you can trust.
I don't know why, but they changed the scent on this product (lavender) a few months ago and it stinks to high heaven now.Will never use it again. Boo!
I've been using Tide for almost 50 years. Tried others, but always come back to Tide.Since they've added scents, its even better.
I have been using tide with a touch of Downy since it came out, have been useing Tide sice high school I trust it to get stains out. April Fresh is by far the fav in my household.
I have been using regular tide and it works perfect. I bought Tide Downy and used it for couple of times and I had worst experience as stains of the liquid detergent stays on the clothes. Its so frustrating and I would never ever refer this product.
I love tide. I have tried them all and I always come back to tide. I want my clothes to be as clean as they can get, and that is what i get when i use tide.
Tide Plus a Touch of Downey is soooo WONDERFUL!! It leaves our clothes smelling great! After trying other brands TIDE has won my heart...it brings clothes back to life!! I LOVE IT!
Tide is the favorite at my house. Several years ago, I bought another product on sale and my husband knew immediately. He said his clothes did not smell clean enough. I had to agree that the wash seemed, well, unwashed. I love Tide and Downy and having the two products together is a match made in wash day heaven. I love all of the scents but the traditional April Fresh is my favorite. Even the dirty laundry smells fresh at my house.
I adore this product Tide with the fabric softner in it, because it is double tough on stains, yet gentle on your clothes with a wonderful soft feel, and scent that not only help your clothes but when used like I use it, it's your house poupourri too. I Love it so much I had a fear that it would be taken off the market because usually when I fall in Love with a product without a doubt it's soon off the market and I don't know what I'd do then.
I have always used Tide laundry detergent. That is why I was so happy when they came out with Tide with touch of Downy! The scent reminds me of being at my grandmothers home in the country, where there were endless fields and many happy times. I love this detergent and refuse to buy anything else. I suggest everyone give it a try! I dont think you will be disappointed!
Smells great and clothes are clean and smell fresh for days and days!!!!!
We have a big family and cannot always afford Tide or Downy...although...I just splurged on both and WOW! I just want to rewash everything! Our clothes smell AMAZING!
i have used tide for years it has always taken out anything my girls got on their clothes. and now they 33yrs now i use tide with downy and i love it all my girls use it i have 7 grandchildren that live with me and their moms we all use tide with downy . piglet
I am a Critical Care ER Nurse and frequently during my shift I am required to sweat just a bit. CPR, pulling people out of cars, intense cases the sweating can be profuse. I have noticed with this detergent that when I am moving around vigorously I am still smelling fresh. To the point that my coworkers have commented how good my clothes smell when they walk past me. But not so much that if effects people's allergies as perfume can. Thank you for developing this product. It is a pleasant experience.
I only use TIDE. When I see the special items such as Downy in my TIDE, I grab the bottle and go. The one thing I dislike is that Lavendar is alway the bottle that is not as large as the other types. Lavendar is a soothing smell and it is loved by everyone in my family. Only wish we could have the same amoun of loads as the other types =)
What could be better than the best detergent there is with a touch of your favorite softener?? I grew up with Tide, wouldn't wash with anything else and now that they've added a "touch of Downy" as far as I'm concerned it's PERFECT! Keep up the great washes Tide!
I am a tide/downy junkie. When the downy balls came out years ago I was sure they were made just for me.My family has been in the restaurant business and my son worked the saute' area and his co-workers would say "your mom does your laundry because we can smell the downy and your chef coats are always so white. Will she do ours?"What a compliment! Love the products and can always tell if they have been used in other places!!!My grown children and grandson always want me to do the laundry. Not sure if this is a blessing or if they really like the difference.
We grew up using Tide. Now, the difference is the wonderful smells, and the fact that it is not all water in the bottle
I love the way my clothes come out smelling so nice with the Touch of Downy. I've tried just regular Tide and the clothes are stiff, don't have such a fresh smell. Touch of Downy is just what every load of laundry needs :)
I use Tide with Downy and love it! It smells nice which makes my laundry smell fresh and clean. The added Downy is nice as it gets my clothes soft and it still cleans the best of any detergent I have used.
What happened to the ORIGINAL April Fresh Touch of Downy Tide? I thought it was just me, but after reading these reviews, I now know that Tide changed the smell. Why would you mess with something that was such a good product??? I agree with the person who said if you want to add a different scent, then fine..but keep the old one too! This stiff smells like sweet, disgusting candy and I miss the old Tide. I have been smelling all the bottles at the store thinking it was just me. BRING BACK THE OLD SCENT!!!
My grandaughter told her mother she should use the same laundry soap as Mimi because everything smelled so nice! All my grandchildren's clothes come out so clean and bright, a noticeable difference from what they use for a detergent at home.
I have always been a fan of Tide, but this Tide with Downy is awesome!! It makes my clothes smell so fresh and good. I won't buy anything else!
I LOVE the tide plus a touch of downy liquid detergent more than any other detergent of any other brand I have tried. Lavender is my very favorite and I use it all the time. Lately, however, I can't find it -ANYWHERE- near me. What gives? I've looked all over Charlotte. :(
I've been using Tide with Downy Clean Breeze for over four years now. Since the product now includes ActiLift, the smell has changed, which is disappointing. It's not a bad smell, but it's different from what I'm used to. I'm thinking of changing detergents because of it...
I love Downy Fresh Tide. It is the ONLY laundry detergent my mom would EVER use and just the smell of it brings back memories of her.
I was raised on Tide-down through the years they have continued to improve the product making it a top selling brand. I like the touch of Downy with Tide the best. I would definitely recommed this product to any and everyone.
this is great i love the smell and it took some tough stains out. it all so made my clothes look good as new.
I would never trust my clothes to any other brand. Tide has always be one to get stains and my clothes the cleanest
The only thing I've found that makes my towels smell good after use.
We have used Tide in our family for as long as I can remember. Last month I tried the Tide with Downy. A week ago my fiance said to me, "I do not know what you are doing different but I really like the way my clothes have smelled lately. I do use a fabric softner (not downy) but, the this version of Tide compliments it well for our family's body chemistry. I am not fond of the other scents. But that is only because they just don't work for us. Thank you for the scent diversity.
Tide with Lavender scented Downy is one my all time favorite smells. This is a smell I associate with home. My bedding smells wonderful and I get so many comments on how great I smell when I'm not even wearing perfume! And it's all because of my laundry detergent.I love it and I even have a friend who swears by it now after doing laundry with me while we were roommates. Thanks Tide, and please keep producing my favorite smell. :)
The scent is so strong that I can not stand it. I don't know why they don't offer Tide with Downy with the original scent or unscented. It appears by reading other reviews that many other people are unhappy too.
I loved the original liquid Tide With a Touch of Downy April Fresh scent. It left a lot of fragrance in the clothes - a fragrance that I really liked. Since being re-formulated with Acti-Lift, the fragrance is not the same. Both the April Fresh and Lavender varieties have an off-odor. You can smell it from the bottle and in the clothes. Clothes do not have the lingering and intense fragrance that they did with the old version. I don't know whether Acti-Lift improves cleaning performance or not, but it sure doesn't improve the fragrance! Am I the only one that has noticed this?I plan to go back to the powder version since I think that has not been re-formulated.P&G insists on fooling around with trusted formulas to maintain product marketing freshness but they ultimately lose a lot of loyal customers.
"" I love the sent of Tide plus Downy it reminds me of home'''
I really love this tide detergent. i like the scent too. I get cuddly soft clothes all in one step!
I Love the Tide with downy Lavender scent but can't find it anywhere. Does anybody know where to get it? With this many people that like it, its hard to believe they would stop selling it. I have looked at every store with no luck. Please Tide get this scent back in my area!!!
The product itself is fair however I don't like the smell. The bottle is a horrible design. You can either pump the liquid or pour it. It's been a complete mess. I've used Tide products for years but will not use this one again. Give me powder any day that you pour out of a box.
I started to use TIDE long time a go, and i really love it, it makes the clothes really clean, soft, and smell great, and the most important thing is that tide never damage or change the fabrics.i moved to live at Saudi Arabia now, u can find every detergent and every brand in here, but it is too difficult to find LIQUID TIDE.i wish it can be available here with all kind of its different scents and purposes
The new scent is far too strong. Why can't companies leave a good product alone? I am going to have to find an alternative.
Love Love the Lavender - but like others it is hard to find in our area - PLEASE PLEASEmake it availableThe scent is wonderful and I received compliments on it.Make it more available, PLEASE
I absolutely love the lavendar scent tide. It made my clothes smell so good. I am also very sensitive to laundry detergent and have found that tide is about the only product I can use. My only disappointment is that the stores in our area quit carring this particular scent. I do not care for the smell of the other scents so now I have been forced to buy the unscented.
This "new" HE with Downy, while it cleans well has a very terrible smell. I don't like having the family laundry smell like cheap candy. PLEASE CHANGE IT BACK!
I used ERA until I went to school and was shopping for detergent and realized the store I was shopping at didn't have it so I decided to try tide. I love the lavender scent and cannot find it anywhere and this is sad. I have tried other touch of downey scents but none are as good as the lavender one. Someone please tell me where I can find this scent so that I don't have to switch to another detergent that is lavender scented.
I have used Tide with April fresh Downy for YEARS!!! It is the only detergent I use, and I do at least two large loads of laundry daily. It is the only scent that doesn't give me a massive headache, while still leaving a clean, soft pleasant scent on my clothes, towels, and sheets. When I opened the latest bottle, I thought there had been a mistake at the bottling plant--this new scent STINKS!!! Everyone in my family hates it. I went to the store today and smelled every bottle of every detergent by every manufacturer--I can't stand any of them. Now I don't know what I'm going to wash my clothes with, but it won't be Tide any more. Why try to fix something that wasn't broken? After 20 years of being a loyal Tide consumer, I'm now going to have to switch brands.Mom of Four
I LOVE the lavender scent!!! I like to wash my towels and sheets with it, such a relaxing fragrance. I just wish I could find it more often in the stores. It's VERY HARD for me to find. Any suggestions on maybe an online place to purchase???
I am so upset. Tide with April Fresh Downy was my absolute favorite scent in the entire world. It is the only detergent I would let touch my clothes. I washed my pillowcases every week just so I could smell it when I laid down to sleep. It was my comfort smell and now it's GONE!!! I will never purchase this product again unless it changes back to the original. Now it smells like Sweet Tarts candy....AWFUL CHANGE! I have never been so upset over a product change in my life. PLEASE change it back!!!
tried this for the first time and my clothes have spots and are stained. followed all the directions, and tried every method i can to avoid these and nothing helps! never had issues with the original tide!
I love the Lavender scented Tide...it is by far the best scent, but they need to make it for the front loading washers...HE! Please!
I absolutely loved using Tide and Downy Simple Pleasures Lavender with Vanilla. After many e-mails to the company, I finally got a real response. I was told that Downy's Lavender Serenity is Simple Pleasures Lavender with Vanilla renamed. Now I use Tide with a touch of Downy Lavender scent and Downy's Lavender Serenity. It smells good, but still not quite good enough on Tide's end. Hope they redo it and soon!Thank you!
My family and I love the smell of the laundry when I use the 2x Ultra Tide with a touch of Downy - April Fresh. I still have to use a dryer sheet due to static though so I have gone back to my usual Tide product.
I recently bought a tide with Aprilfresh Downy in it and it is bad. I have used it for years but will not continue unless it is changed back. It smelled like fruit flavored certs. Why did you change it?
I love Tide with a Touch of Downey, It gets the clothes so clean and fresh and helps with static in sweaters and socks.I recommend Tide products to all my friends and will continue to do so.
Why did you guys change the scent? I would like the original Downy scent back. This product smelled so bad I had to give it away. I used the April Fresh.
I love this product, especially to wash my bed linens. But I can't find it anymore. Where can I buy it?
Why was this scent CHANGED? It is terrible now. I have been a faithful buyer of this product and scent for many years. In the last few months, the scent has changed and not for the better. If you wanted a different scent.... MAKE A DIFFERENT SCENT! Don't change a scent that is already established. I had to re-wash all of my clothes. I thought it was just a bad bottle so I bought another. Nope, it was changed so I returned the product and told my family who also uses the same scent. I hope that you will change it back, otherwise I will continue using GAIN from now on.
Perhaps this would be a useful product for a non-HE machine that doesn't have its own softener cup, but any HE machine I am aware of has a softener cup built in and there's no need for the restrictive nature of this product. Furthermore, any towels or microfiber used for automobile purposes should never have softener added (along with an increasing amount of clothing). Take the top-rated Coldwater HE Free or Tide HE Free and Sensitive and add your favorite scent of Downy or Downy Free, if you must. The performance of the product is a 5, but the unnecessary aspect of the product is why I rated it a 3.
I used to love Tide with April Fresh smell. I loved the way it made my clothes smell! But the last two months I have bought it the smell is terrible! I don't have that fresh Downy smell anymore! Tide bring back the smell! I had to switch back to Gain for that fresh clean smell again! I will keep smelling it and will buy it once that Downy April fresh smell comes back. In the meantime though I will use Gain or All (no perfumes) So that I can enjoy that Downy April fresh smell.
The Tide with a Touch of Downy is wonderful. I purchased the Lavender and the laundry smell amazing for days. GREAT PRODUCT!
i love this product. My family wont let me buy any other detergent. Our clothes smell so fresh even before putting them in the dryer. I think the most important thing about using Tide is how clean it gets our clothes. I recommend Tide to all my friends
I have used Tide most of my life, and the lavendar scented Tide was just perfect for me. I only use it on my laundry as my two teenage boys don't want to smell "like a flower." My biggest problem is locating it at a store. I love this product!
I tried many other brands ,now i only use Tide with a touch of downy ,I love the way it cleans and smells.Tide works best with my hard water ..
I absolutly love this product my favorite sent is the april fresh...My clothes are very clean and smell great..I would recomend this product to any i meet..thank you
I got red sweet and sour sauce and hot fudge on my blouse. I thought my blouse was ruined. I took liquid Tide and cold water and put it directly on the stain and rubbed the Tide into the stain. The stain totally and completely came out!!!
I love the Tide with Downy Clean Breeze. I was riding the car with my sister, mother and niece. It started out as a chilly day but warmed up. I ended up leaving my sweatshirt in the back of the car. Forgot all about it. My niece, mom and sister dropped my off at my house. Later on, my niece (4 yrs old) asked "who's sweatshirt is this. She smelt it and said "mmm its Laurie's!" Even she would agree that the Tide with downy is great!!!
Tide is a great product love the smell and the way it cleans my families clothes. I enjoy using all the Tide products I've used so far. I also like the differant smells!!! TIDE IS A GREAT PRODUCT.
We have sensitive skin and tide is the only detergent we use.Tide works very well on our cloths and leaves a great smell of downy.
the vanilla & lavender was the best. the lavender by itself doesn't smell half as good. when using vanilla & lavender simple pleasures my migraines occurrences slowed down. now with the lavender only my migraines are coming back more often. downy also switched to lavender only and it smells just as bad. please bring simple pleasures back. vanilla & lavender. thank you
Ok, this is a great product. I have been around the April Fresh Downy scent since the mid 1970's. Nothing smells as good, or as comforting. I have primarily used Tide (all kinds) for decades. Lately, I've noticed the Ultra Downy being too thick, and hard to rinse out of my machine's softener dispenser. I stopped using Downy, but then my clothes were no where near as soft & I had more wrinkles after drying. With Downy inside the detergent...I get clean clothes, soft clothes & scented with Downy April Fresh. I wish it was more softening, but I think cleaning performance would be jeopardized. Overall, a fantastic product!!!
i love this product smell is so great with tide and down love it
This product ruined my clothes! I have always been a loyal Tide customer, but I will never use the Tide with a Touch of Downy again. As I have always done in the past and as many other people do, I pretreated one of my shirts and one of my daughters with this product, not only did it not get the stains out, which the other Tide products do, but it left the blue stain of the Tide on my clothing so they are worse than they started out. Whatever that "touch of Downy" is, it does nothing but stain! I have tried to re wash and hand scrub my shirts but nothing works, the stains are set!
I love lavender, but this does not have the comforting scent that Simple Pleasures had. Please bring back Simple Pleasures Lavender & Vanilla!!! I have been hunting all over for it. I use Tide Free on microfibers, because fabric softner ruins them. I use Total Care, for the supposed benefits, but do not like the scent at all, so I mix in the Lavender & Vanilla. I also do not like other florals or mountain scents. I will have to find a different brand, after using Tide forever, unless you bring it back.
This is a wonderful smelling product. The Lavender product are the ony things that I use! My father only uses the Meadows & Rain products. I've been trying to find a place where he can purchase them. These products are the only we will buy! We love them!!!!
I am not really crazy about this scent. It is too pungent. I want you to bring Tide Simple Pleasures Lavender/Vanilla back. It smelled so good and I was so disappointed to find out you stopped making it. I wasn't a tide user before Tide Simple Pleasures and I guess now that its gone I will have to find a new favorite detergent. Sad because everyone that smelled my laundry or sheets became a user of tide simple pleasures lavender/vanilla
I don't think that I can ever change to any other detergent after using this product. I LOVE the smell of the lavendar as it fills my house while doing laundry, It is my favorite!
I have been using Tide for over 20 years. When I see Tide with a Touch of Downy I decide to try it. I love the softness and how clean my cloths get. Every now and then I will switch around and use Tide & Downy Totalcare, Simply Tide etc. but I alway come back to Tide with a Touch of Downy. I'm loving it.
Tide has been used in my house snice I was born. Tide with Downy is just a extraordinary! I had stains that I don't even remember how I got on my clothes, but Tide with Downy cleaned it out and soften my clothes. Now 18 years of age and now on my own. One detergent I always get is Tide with Downy, hands down. Its great to see that you blind other people with your white shirt! :)
I love Tide I'v been using it for at least 20 years. I've tried other brands and the best brand is the one and only "Tide". Tide gets my entire family's clothes clean. No one in my family has any type of allergic reaction to Tide " like we have had with other brands" . I trust Tide to get my clothes clean , and remove stains.I recomend Tide all time to friends and relatives.
Although this product is okay, it's not nearly as fragrant as the Simple Pleasures Lavender/Vanilla, or, my favorite, Water Lily and Jasmine. Please bring it back!
I love it. My customers love it. Clean,Relaxing,Soft
I love both smells Lavender with a touch of downy and Lavender with vanilla, both are awesome, please don't discontinue..PLEASE...
Our clothes come out of the washer smelling worse than they went in! I like regular Tide, but add the Downy and I get clothes that smell like a combination of moldy wet towels and body odor. I hate this product! Don't waste your money!
I have always used Tide and love your product. I recently purchased your new Tide HE with a Touch of Downy. What a fresh scent. My husband, a lover of the outdoors and not the toughy feely kind of man, noticed the fresh scent and commented on how nice the laundry smelled as well as the softness. If this man would notice such a change, what a compliment to you.
Would not use anything else. Well... except another Tide product. As a consumer and a working mom, I realize that Tide products are more expensive than other brands BUT the quality is well worth the price! I will never switch. I have well water, and also wash almost all laundry in cold water. Tide is the ONLY product that cleans even my whites or my husband's dirty hunting and fishing, or work clothes that get covered with grease. In hard times, I have dropped other name brand items for less expensive ones, but I WILL NEVER DROP MY TIDE.
SOOOO upset that my favorite detergent has been discontinued. The Simple Pleasures Lavendar and Vanilla (purple bottle) was the absolute best!!!! It had the best fragrance and nothing else compares. PLEASEEEEE bring it back!!! This new scent is just not the same!
When I use Tide with Downy, I don't have to spend the extra money for softener. Its in the detergent. I love it!
I have never liked Downy...and really don't like this new product. I LOVED LOVED LOVED the purple bottle and the fragrance. I don't understand why they discontinued a loved product and replaced it with thIS...BAD CHOICE
P&G, please listen to consumers and bring back Simples Pleasures Lavendar & Vanilla! It was the only scent that actually smelled like the combination of Lavendar & Vanilla. I didn't realize they were discontinuing it and I am so disappointed, like everyone else. I used it because I live far from my family and it smells like my mother's home!
Why did you discontinue the simple pleasures vanilla lavander??? I absolutely loved this scent!! Especially for my sheets. Please,please bring it back. I'm so disappointed in this new product.
I use the Tide HE detergent with a touch of Downy, but there is only one scent to choose from. I love the product and would like to see Tide provide consumers with more choices for HE washers--especially the detergent with a touch of Downy!!
I think Tide is a great detergent, i use less and makes your clothes smell great. the only down fall i find with it is the price. it is so expensive i just wish it would be just a little more affordable so please take this into concideration.
This new fragrance doesn't hold a candle to the Vanilla & Lavender Simple Pleasures Tide in the purple bottle. I bought out every purple bottle I could find and now the stores in my area have run out. Please bring back the Vanilla & Lavender fragrance! No other laundry detergent on the market smells as good and works as good as the purple bottle!!!!!!!!!!I do not like the new Lavender fragrance and the "Touch of Downy!"
OMG! I did not realize you are discontinuing the Vanilla/Lavender scent. It rocks! Seriously I have three teenage boys that wear very expensive football gear, and I wear Under Armour work out clothing that says do not use FABRIC SOFTENER on the label. Please bring back the Vanilla/Lavender scent without the fabric softener in it. I never smelled something so amazing. I actually look forward to doing laundry with your product. THANKS!!!
I LOVED the Simple Pleasures Lavender & Vanilla! This new substitute smells AWFUL. I was thrilled to be able to find something that actually smelled like natural Lavender. BRING IT BACK!
I loved the Tide Vanilla/Lavender product in the purple container along with the Downy drier sheets in the same scent. The smell of this new product is awful. I am switching to another brand. Sorry -- I want the purple bottle back!
I had used Tide with a touch of Downey before I had gotten my front loader washing machine. I loved the washer, but couldn't use the Tide with a touch of Downey , because at the time it wasn't available in HE. Last week, when I went to the store, I was very excited to see that Tide with a touch of Downey, was now available in HE!!!! Believe it or not, I couldn't wait to get home and try it, and I wasn't disappointed!!! I love it. Now, I buy one bottle , instead of having to buy the bottle of Tide, and another of Downey. I am a fan for life!!! Thanks Tide!
When I was younger my grandmother always bought Tide. She was on a limited income but would always say Tide was worth the extra expence.It wasnt until I was an adult that I found out what she meant. Tide not only gets clothes clean but offers a lasting nice smell. I will never buy anything else but Tide and Downey. Im truly glad Tide was a part of my growing up and hope to pass on the "tradition" to my kids.....Thanks Tide for standing the test of time and still coming out on top!!
I agree with about everyone else that you need to bring back the simple pleasures lavender vanilla scent. It's all my family ever uses and we are very disappointed that you don't offer it anymore. Not a good move.
Even though the Lavender and Vanilla costs much more in most stores, I LOVE THE WAY IT SMELLS AND DO NOT WANT TO PURCHASE ANY OTHER SCENTS!! I agree with the other reviews that state the Lavender alone does not come close in comparison! I did buy the new scent because I had no other choice, but I was not happy about it. PLEASE BRING THE ORIGINAL, TRUE LAVENDER AND VANILLA SCENT BACK! AT LEAST GIVE US LOYAL SHOPPERS OF TIDE PRODUCTS THE CHOICE TO BUY WHAT WE WANT!! I ACTUALLY PREFER ONLY LAVENDER AND VANILLA SCENTS FOR TIDE, DOWNY, BLEACH, AND BOUNCE DRYER SHEETS!!! Thank You!
As a mother of 2 rough boys, I have ALWAYS bought Tide! I am on a very tight budget, but the expense of Tide is not even a question! In my opinion, the expense of Tide is the lesser expense; than purchasing new clothes once they are stained or fading in color! I LOVE Tide & Downy, and would NEVER purchase any other laundry detergent or softener!!!! I would recommend these products to anyone! My favorite is Clean Breeze Tide, and Clean Breeze Downy Liquid, followed by Clean Breeze dryer sheets!!!
I just bought the new touch of downy lavender smell and I am in love! the smeel is amazing, and soft. Just as a future reference if you sold Lilac I would be front of the line. Thanks for such great products.
This is a terrible scent. I am searching for any brand that smells like your Lavendar and Vanilla liquid detergent. I don't like any other scent of the Tide liquid detergent. So, our family is greatly dissapointed that you have discontinued the Simple Pleasures Lavendar and Vanilla detergent.
This product stinks I am so upset that I can not get lavender and vanilla anymore, why is this? I have never smelt a laundry detergent that was so wonderful get rid of this and bring back what everyone loves plsssssss
i don't care for the change in the smell. i like the old formula. it was great and all the family loved the smell of laundry. PLEASE BRING BACK THE ORIGINAL LAVENDAR & VANILLA!!!!!
I agree with other comment posted regarding yucky new lavender scent. I don't like it. My kids and I love the lavender with vanilla. We miss it. Bring it back out. Have had a hard time replacing that scent with one the whole family agreed on. Were still sniffing lids searching for the scent that use to make us say ahhh......
I don't like the new Lavender. I wish you would bring back Lavender Vanilla. I loved this scent and have purchased what I think is the last bottle in Austin.
I hate this new Downy Lavender Scent! Bring back the Tide Simple Pleasures Lavender and Vanilla!
I had tried other brands a few times, but always came back to Tide. I swear by it. Here we are in 2009 & it's still the only brand I buy. My daughter uses it also.
I only buy Tide liquid. It is the only detergent that I can count on to clean my clothes the first time. I was happy to see Downy added to the detergent, I usually use the dryer sheets, because I forget to add the softener. Thank you it is a wonderful product.
I've been using Tide for 39 years. It was my mother's (of 14, 8 boys) brand and now my daughter and daughter-in-law are on the Tide train because they want their laundry to look and smell like mine. I can't decide which Tide to buy so I keep mutiple kinds always making sure one is a liquid so I can dose my grandsons' bad stains as they go into the washer. The liquid with Downy is fabulous for towels as it doesn't interfere with their absorbency and allows them the fluffy softness of a Downy rinse.
I was waiting for the HE version to come out in this detergent! Although it doesn't do quite the same job on brightening whites as the Tide with Bleach does, the scent and softness are worth it. I just add a little color safe bleach to the load when running my whites. I have never had a problem with this streaking my whites and it gets used in my busy household almost daily - I did run into that problem from time to time when using the original Downy liquid fabric softener in the wash. This is a great detergent - the Tide classic quality with the incredible Downy scent!
Well let me start by saying this site brings u in bogusly by offering u coupons, then lo and behold u gotta take a survey. I love ur product n would recomend it 2 the world n i'm still goin 2 purchase it. Just wanted you'll 2 know this was very Unkool. Tracey
I have been a user of Tide my entire adult life and after trying other brands a few times, I always return to Tide.
I truly love, love, love the scent of the Tide with Downy and how much more convenient it is to carry and how much money I save having it combined like this! My dollar goes much further and that makes me much happier! I had to explain to my daughter, 16, that just because a product is cheaper doesn't make it better. I have noticed how my clothes don't fade as quickly as my friend's (who uses a very cheap store brand) does. It is worth the money to get a great product such as Tide w/Downy to keep my clothes looking great.
had tide with a touch of downy april fresh shipped to england at a great expense, but this product is worth every penny!! please start selling it in england!!!
Tide is such a great product. Cleans like NO other!! I had problems with the dispensing of the fabric softener. I either missed the cycle or was late causing stains. Even the ball wasn't perfect. But this solved ALL the problems & freshens my clothing like NO other. What a lifesaver & TIME saver too.
I have some clothes that I air-dry in my room. And thanks to Tide with a touch of Downy paired with Downy of the same scent, I awaken to a room full of freshness.
Right now my wife is on silent treatment from me. I went out of town and she bought a lesser-shall remain unnamed detergent. Can you believe it!! 14 years she has known me, I refuse to use anything other than Tide. I dont know what she was hoping to 'Gain' by saving a buck. Thank goodness I already knew we would need detergent soon and came home with Tide in hand. I opened the cap of the 'other stuff' jst to smell what was so great that they have to advertise the product with the only premise that its fragrance is wonderful. ACK, it was so terrible! I was reminded of being stuck in an elevator with a woman who was wearing way too much perfume, hehe. Viva La Tide!
I HAVE RESENTLY FOUND OUT THAT WITH TIDE HE, YOU DON'T HAVE TO USE THE DISPENSER WITH THE FRONT LOAD MACHINES, AND BY USING JUST THE PLASTIC MEASURE CUP YOU GET MORE FOR YOUR BANG. WITH TIDE HE YOU DON'T HAVE TO FILL IT TO THE LEVEL ON YOUR FRONT LOAD MACHINEST O GET THE COMPLETE CLEAN WASH THAT TIDE STATES, "BECAUSE TIDE IS THAT GOOD OF A CLEANER". JUST USE THE MEASURE CUP AND YOU WILL SEE THAT YOUR CLOTHS COME OUT JUST AS CLEAN AND YOU CAN GET THE NUMBER OF LOADS THAT THE BOTTLE OF "TIDE HE," STATES YOU SHOULD RECEIVE ON EACH PURCHASE. THIS IS THE WAY I GO ABOUT SAVING MONEY IN THESE HARD TIMES. MANY THANKS GOES OUT TO MY BETTER_HALF. REGARDS TO ALL TIDE USERS!!! ENJOY THE SAVINGS...
All I use is Tide & Downey, my clothes always come out clean & smelling great. Thank you for a great product.
I reside in a veterans' home, and the clothes washer is used countless times both day and night. I need a detergent that is both strong, durable, and pleasant smelling. I found gold when I purchased Tide. You have my unending thanks.
I have used Tide and only Tide for the past 36 years and it is the only laundry wash I can ever remember my mother using. Mom always cut corners where she could, but when it came to her Tide, there was no compromising. I have used Tide with Downy for quite a while now and have no plans to change brands. Thank you for this wonderful product.(Would have given it 5 stars, but my computer won't let me)
This is an old, but true Liquid Tide story: in fact, I tried to call the company when it happened, because in my mind it is the perfect commercial and testment to the unique and amazingly effective abilities of Liquid Tide.My then five year old son was entertaining five of his friends about four hours before Yom Kippur, the holiest night and day of the Jewish calendar.Our neighbors next door had a raccoon trap in their back yard, and had evidently caught a raccoon, so I told him that he could go next door to show his friends. A short time later, I heard frantic screams from all of the children.Evidently, the trap had caught a SKUNK and not a raccoon, who promptly sprayed all five children from a very close range, my son receiving a direct hit from a very close range. I had six smelly, hysterical and frightened children on my hands. I promptly undressed all of the kids, threw their clothes in a pile and put them in the bathtub. Then, I called their mothers to pick them up. My son, who took the worst hit, and his clothes reeked from a smell more like gasoline than the traditional skunk smell. I took the clothes and was about to throw them out, when I thought, "well, I have nothing to lose" and put them in the washing machine with my trusty Liquid Tide. (I must admit, even then, I was very careful about purchashing anything, and I would only use a "Name brand" product, in favor of a store brand, when I felt that the quality and effectiveness warranted it. Well, to my utter AMAZEMENT, the clothes came out smelling clean and fresh, and the washing maching was equally fine, although I elected to run another empty wash with Liquid Tide just to make sure that there was no residue.I continue to use Liquid Tide with pride and confidence to this day, and now that my sons are both grown and out of the house, they use it as well!(Cleaning my son on the other hand, was a much more difficult proposition. I called my pediatrician, the emergency room at the local hospital and finally put him in the bathroom and used gallons of tomato sauce, and then soap).If I had been able to reach the Tide offices at the time to confirm that I could wash my son in it, I would have tried, We all made it to synagogue clean and pure and on time.But, to this day, over fifteen years later, I tell the story with amusement and amazement and gratitude.
I am a dedicated athlete and lawn upkeeper. Your product is quite simply the "go to" solution for any and all cleaning issues I have with all of my clothes from the gym to the front yard. They look great, smell clean and feel soft. It's what you promise and you deliver!
I've always used Tide and Downy softner and have told my husband several times...I wish, they would just put these together so I wouldn't have to buy both and have it take up room in my laundry room. So, it was great to finally see these product together and it works GREAT. I love the idea of buying just the one product for two. Now, I wish, it wasn't so pricey.
My hubby does the wash will use nothing but tide. He says that it is the only product that gets our clothes clean and smell great at the same time. He just changed to the Tide Liq. HighEff. and raves even more. He told his friend whichdoes thier wash also and he raves about the TIDE PRODUCTS too. Its strange to see two men chat over how great the wash turn out.Thanks P&G
I have learned the hard way and over the years that you get what you pay for. Tide detergent is my favorite laundry product and is well worth the price (although I would certainly love if they put out more coupons for it)! It removes stains so well and leaves our clothes smelling so fresh and clean. Downy fabric softener is also our favorite, so when they came out with the combo product I was very excited! The only drawback I find to the combo is that I don't normally use fabric softener on my kitchen towels and dishrags. The softener makes the towels less absorptive and dishes don't dry well. I will forever be loyal to the Tide and Downy brands but believe in the future I will stick to the seperate products. :)
I absolutely love the Tide with Downy. I line dry most of my clothes and I don't have to worry about adding fabric softner to the rinse cycle.
I'm a very thrifty stay at home mom of five kids. Needless to say, I do a lot of laundry and I don't have a lot of extra money. However, I do believe you get what you pay for. Tide with Downy is one of my tried and true products. The cost is comparable to the cheapest of products, because you don't have to buy a separate softener, it's very concentrated therefore very effective, there's always a coupon available, and sales. What I like most about Tide with Downy, is that I don't have to do an extra step adding softener, and folding the laundry is so enjoyable because it feels and smells SO good...which helps, considering how much folding there is.
I love washing my clothes in Tide original scent. I recently brought the Tide with Downy combination product. I washed my towels and noticed that they came out discoloured. So I brought the Tide Washing Machine Cleaner thinking that it was the washer, since I had moved into a new apartment. I washend a second load and a few ariticles of clothing came out discoloured as well. I will be switching back to the regular Tide. I called the company to make them aware of this.
I would agree Tide is on the pricier side, but I have yet to find another detergent that excels in stain removal, smells great, softens my clothes and eliminates static cling all in one bottle. Well worth the cost!
Tide with a touch of downy april fresh it is on the expensive side, but well worth it, and the smell is just awesome!!! i like the fact that you can buy 2 products for the price of one.
I have been using Tide for over 10 years. I have tried less expensive brands and none compare with Tide. Almost all other laundry detergents have a perfumed smell and that is just what you have. The smell. WithTide and the different aromas your cothes are clean and the smell is not overpowering. I am sold on Tide and would challeng anyone who believes the product they buy is better. Thanks Tide for being a positvely good laundy detergent.
I have just tried 2x Ultra Tide with a touch of Downy, April Fresh. The product is great. It gets the stains out while leaving the clothes with the wonderful smell I love of the Downy product. It also eliminates the use of a fabric sheet. In so doing cuts down on waste (sheet & box). I love this new Tide keep up the good work!Thank youLesa
I just used this product on a load of whites that included my son's work shirts, baseball pants, and my husband's coaching shirt. When I took the clothes out of the washer, there were blue spots, lines, and streaks the same color as the detergent on almost every piece of clothing. I immediately put all of the items back in the washer to soak and stain treat, but unfortunately, nothing worked. My husband's coaching shirt and my son's work shirts are ruined. Because the baseball pants were all white, I was able to use a RIT dye product to eliminate most of the stains. I will not use this product again, and will stick to using regular tide.
My boyfriend and I work at the local newspaper in the mail room and it's filthy down there, so naturally we get filthy. I used another kind of detergent for years but i never had a job where i got so dirty that the clothes never got fully cleaned in the wash. I gave up and bought a small box of tide while at the laundry mat and our clothes were cleaner than i've ever gotten them, I now use the other brand for towels and sheets and Tide for the clothes.
Tide with Downy April Fresh is my all time favorite detergent. It makes my laundry smell so good and the scent lasts. The only problem is most stores that I shop do not carry this particular kind. I truly hope this product will remain on the shelves no matter what new products you introduce.
I don't recommend this product because it has a tends to leave my white clothes dingy unless I do excessive rinsing, which makes me use more water.
I tried it once and now it will be my favorite on my shopping list.
I HAVE TRIED DIFFERENT KINDS OF DETERGENTS AND JUST COULDN'T GET THAT FRESH SMELL I WAS LOOKING FOR. SO WHEN I TRIED TIDE WITH DOWNY IT WAS A AMELL THAT LAST ALL DAY, AND CONSIDERING THE WORK THAT MY HUSBAND DOES HE SAYS THROUGHOUT THE DAY HE STILL SMELL THE FRESHNESS OF HIS CLOTHES. I LOVE IT AND WILL STICK TO IT. TIDE YOU HAVE A WINNER.
This has got to be the best laundry detergent I have ever used. When I do my families clothes I love them to put things on and say WOW my this smells so fresh. The one thing that would my it even better is if you put a safe all kind of bleach with it. New name could be TIDE,SOFTNER,BLEACH one bottle for all loads. Thanks Tide.
My clothes came out of the dryer full of static and hard. It felt like had my clothes dried outside on the clothes line. I won't by this product again.
We are regular Tide users - and happy with the product. Recently we purchased the 72 load, lay on it's side package with a spicket. The packaging offers no benefit over the standard packaging, and in fact makes a complete and total MESS! The amount of detergent that was wasted probably comes close to 25% of the loads it is supposed to deliver. Tide is a good detergent - stick with good packaging - get rid of the fancy mess maker. Pictures attached.
Tide is a great product to begin with, but since I have tried the product with a touch of Downy, we wont be trying any others. This works GREAT and with 2 very active kids, it really has the cleaning power. But the scent and feel is the reason we have changed from regular tide to this product. I have even re washed some clothing just so they can smell as wonderful and feel as soft as all the other. Kudos to Tide, you have a winner with this product.My only complaint is the price. It is a little more expensive, and with todays ecomony any help would be appreciated although ounce for ounce Tide is still the better chioce.Keep up the great workLoyal consumer for over 18 years and 18 more to come for sure! Thanks
Tide is by far the best detergent and worth every penny, and the April Fresh Touch of Downy combines the 2 greatest laundry treaters(Tide and Downy) into one treatment! The April Fresh scent smells so good, and I am saving $ by having to buy only 1 product.
I love the tide with downy its awesome it cleans great and smells so good! It also has great stain fighting power . My whole family loves it!!
I have rarely used any other brand. This variation says me time and money and space in my closets - and I need space! My clothes are truly clean when I wash with Tide and now I only have to pour one liquid and go! It also smells good.
I have been using this product for a couple of years and love it for my colored wash. It gets rid of grease stains and cleans everything. It also has a little Downy in it to soften the clothes so they are nice and soft when dried.
Tide is my only choice when it comes to laundry detergents. It's always dependable, always available, and it always works against my toughest laundry needs. Thanks for always providing me with exactly what I want and need. In these times, it's nice to know that my dollar is being spent on a product I can count on.
I love Tide. Easily washes away stains and dirt. It leaves clothes smelling fresh as well!
Works very well on stains.
This is the first I've used the febreze kind. I prefer the tide with color safe bleach personally. This was good since the store didn't have anything else. I will say that the smell lasts and lasts. I used this on a couple blankets and they still smell just as fresh and strong as the day I washed them which was a couple weeks ago now. Pretty nice!
i like this product, but smells bad.
I've always used Tide and its easier with the big jug and not as expense as other at dosen't do what Tide does and home delievery makes thing very good
I must say buying this detergent definitely saved me some money and I don't have to buy detergent for the next two months! I will always buy my detergent from this website.
I think it's the best detergent I've ever used w/ the Febreeze in it (and April fresh Downy, lol) EVERYONE loves how my clothes & bedding smell.
Great value and it's been working for me for years, never disappoints me :)
My son like's to wash with tide so do I that's all that I use at home !!!
I thought I'd splurge and buy some Tide. I do a lot of laundry and since Tide is the most expensive on the market, I don't buy it often. I was very disappointed in the results. Not sure if I'm allowed to say this, but Era Plus works so much better at getting stains out. No, don't work for Era (whoever makes it?) I just know my laundry.
It smells really good (being that I am a lady), but I don't know that I'd want my man smelling like this. Leaves it soft and fresh for days though.
Very little needs 2 be used 2 get your clothes clean. The scent of febreze still linger after a wash. Works wonders on my husbands socks.
Me and my boyfreind both used this detergent because it smells so great! Unfortunately on 2 separate occasions, in 2 different washing machines, it turned the armpits of our white T-shirts different colors! His turned Red, and mine Black. I do not recommend washing anything white with this detergent.
I was double-washing my laundry because the overwhelming, chemical-smelling odor was so bad. I finally realized it was the Febreze Freshness odor of the Tide laundry detergent that was causing the problem. I would highly recommend that Tide discontinue this fragrance.
Tide plus Febreze Freshness Liquid Laundry Detergent works great. Make my whole house smell GREAT and keeps my clothes smelling great even if I dont wear it for over a week!!!! excellent PRODUCT!!
Not sure how others are getting good results from this product, unless top loaders are getting different result!
I've used Tide for years and appreciate the job it does. I also use the Cold Water Tide for colors and like it as well. The only request I have is to PLEASE consider bringing back the White Lilac scent. It was so soothing and fresh. Company always commented on how good their towels and sheets smelled, even after months in the cupboard.
I absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE Tide with Febreeze!!!! I have washed all my couch cushions in it, my childrens bedding and ALL of our clothes!!! I love the freshness of the smell!!! Thank you for a great product :)
I always buy TIDE and have never complained but I just bought the Febreze Tide because I thought I would enjoy a fresh clean smell but after pulling the clothes out of the dryer there was an overwhelming odor of mildew and after several loads which continued to smell of mildew and dirty feet...I refuse to use it again. I will not recommend to anyone and suggest STRONGLY that you either discontinue the Febreze Tide or find a way to fix it.
I purchased the product to try it. I did 3 loads of laundry. I have rewashed all of the clothes with my normal product. The scent is overwhelming. It is so strong, it overpowers anything else. The worst part is that the scent isn't pleasant. I thought if it were to be strong, it would be a strong floral scent. I can't describe the scent that stays on the clothes. It is as if the soap didn't rinse off.I rewashed all of my clothes and will stick with my original product. At least I tried it! I won't be recommending it to any of my friends.
i was holding my granddaugther that is a year old and she kept smelling my shirt and she would just say aaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh smell again and same thing aaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhh it was so cute but she noticed the great smell i just love tide plus febreze
I love this product! My clothes smells great even after you are wearing them all day.Your clothes come out clean and refreshed.
I love this product. It makes my clothes so clean and smelling fresh.
I have a family of 6 people and we are on a military budget, however I always make sure to put Tide in my budget. I have been using Tide products for 14yrs now and it is the only product that I will use to wash and dry my family clothes with. It gives a freshness and softness to the clothes that cannot be compared to other product. I would like to thank you all for this products and tell you all to keep up the good work.
Love the smell of the Tide with Febreze detergent. I always use it to wash my husband's workout cloths They continue to smell great days later. I use the Tide with Bleach for our day to day cloths and the Tide Free and Clear for sheets and towels. I am a multiple Tide lover! Keep up the good work
Recently I have become a new mother and even though I love this product it has become out of the budget even with the dollar off coupon. I miss my clothes smelling that wonder clean smell. If the cost of the item went down or if I could get better coupons the Tide plus Febreze would be in my laundry room all the time!
I love the smeal, Of Tide with Febreze Sport.But mi color's look terrible, after I used.
I have an 8 year old who plays soccer and it has been particularly rainy lately. His soccer field was a complete swamp and they played anyway. When he got off the field, my husband undressed him at the car and threw his muddy clothes in the trunk. When I got home and went to wash them, I just groaned thinking they would never come clean. One wash later, you cannot even tell they had been soaked in mud...not one spot or stain remained! I wish there was a place to post the before and after pictures!! I am so completely impressed with this Tide...oh and it smells great (spring & renewal)!
This is by far the best scent. Please make it in the larger size and HE.
I have been using tide for as long as I can remember. I love tide and it just got better with Fabreze in it!
We picked up the Tide with Febreze this week! We love it! What a wonderful combination: Tide & Febreze!!! Thank you for this option! And thank you for the kindness that you've shown to disaster victims by sponsoring the Tide LOADS OF HOPE! We're honored to use products that in turn help others!Sincerely,The Potter Family
I have been using tide products for years, and generally, have been pleased. I must comment on the very strange, lingering smell of tide he with febreeze laundry detergent. My best description would be that of cat urine, and yes, I know how that smells, being a cat owner. the smell lingers.It smells our closet and even overwhelms colognes, I am embarrassed to wear these clothes, and am going to have to rewash them. Even my husband,who doesnt even know when I cut 4 inches of hair or move furniture around, noticed and complained, as did our twelve year old daughter. I have two large bottles of this stuff and wont be using it. Is there anyway to get my money back?
My husband's job requires that he remain standing all day while running around managing an entire market. When he gets home, I can smell his feet as if he just hit me across the face with his socks, but with Tide with Febreeze in it sucks away the nasty smell of his socks and leaves a gentle fresh scent which allows my stomach to stop churning! I'm a Tide-and-true fan of Tide!!!
I love febreeze and use it faithfully everyday and now you put my favorite scent of febreeze in my laundry detergent and I LOVE IT. Tide is the ONLY detergent I use and will EVER use. :)Thanks for putting my 2 favorite items together in ONE :)
I have never loved a product as much as Tide Febreze. I have a dog that sleeps with me every night and I washed my comforter with this product and even after 2 weeks since the comforter has been washed I wake up every morning and say, "I can't believe this comforter still smells this GREAT!!!"Also, I workout every day and my clothes were getting to the point where they just never smelled clean after washing them. After using Tide Febreze it is AMAZING how fresh they smell.This is the best detergent ever!!!!
i use to use tide mountain fresh but now the tide with febreze in it is wounderful. I love it. I work out and i do not want to wash such a small load, with tide with febreze i can wait another day. Thanks Tide you will be the only one brought into my house
Where have you been all of my life? I am in love!....I bought Tide w/febreze and I love it! I can wear a top that I washed two weeks ago and still smell the fresh scent. I love it!. Never consider discontinuing this product!
I have grew up seeing my mother using Tide and have continued to use it in my adult years. Your clothes smell so fresh and when you open the drawers or closet, it is like you just took them out of the dryer. My only thing is that I fell in love with Tide with Febreze scent Meadows and Rain. I guess they took it off the market but Spring Renewal is a great substitute. I wouldn't change detergents for anything. Thank you the many years of freshness.
I usually stay away from trying new detergents because of sensitive skin issues in our family, but bought Tide Spring Renewal when my store was out of the original Tide detergent. That was a couple months ago and I won't buy anything else now. Everytime my husband does his laundry he comments about how much he loves the smell of this and he is an auto body mechanic and has commented how he loves that he can still smell the fresh scent in his clothes at the end of his work day. For him to gush about a laundry detergent the way he has...it must be good! Tide - NEVER change or discontinue this formula...it is PERFECT!
I am a fanatic when it comes to my laundry! It has to be clean(obviously), and it has to smell wicked good. I used to take forever in the store picking out a detergent. I had to make sure it smelled just perfect. Well, a little FYI...Tide w/Febreze Freshness Spring & Renewal is awesome! One use and I was hooked. I love this stuff. The only thing is that I really want to buy a bigger bottle. I have been to every local retailer within 30 miles and can't find it in the bigger bottle(see, told you I love it). Do they even offer it in that size? I hope that this particular scent for HE machines never gets discontinued!! Please keep it forever. One bad thing I have to say is, the Tide w/Febreze Sport scent smelled horrible!! I will never buy that particular scent again. It was just gross.
This is the best smelling detergent I've ever used! Please keep it on the market forever!
OK, I have been complaining lately on this website about the scent of liquid Tide original scent since the Acti Lift was added to the formula. That scent is bitter and horrible. I have spent a lot of money trying other Tide scents and have not liked any of them until I tried Tide plus Frebreze Seaside Fresh. I love this smell.I tried the Tide plus Febreze Spring & Renewel and did not like that one at all. It smelled like bubble gum. I kept trying different Tide scents since Tide is the best detergent on the market. It's a shame they ruined the other scents with the Acti Lift , but the Seaside Fresh smells wonderful. Please don't change this one. I wish it came in bigger bottles to make it more cost effective and was available in more stores. I can only find it in one store in my area.For the record, I am not one to write reviews on any product, but I felt compelled to voice my opinion about Tide.
I had not been a fan of tide scents until I tried the tide plus febreze seaside fresh. It is truly my favorite detergent. My clothes smell soooo fresh, and the scent lasts all day. LOVE this product.
Love this product; closet smells wonderful, enjoy ironing clothes again. Hope they keep it available for ever.
I bought HE Tide Sport and I love it! It makes my laundry smell great. I've tried all sorts of other HE detergents, but have not found any that compete with Tide.
I am a mom of two daughters, ages 8 and 2. My daughters and I LOVE the smell/scent of Tide plus Febreze, and Tide SPORT! Every week we strip the bed linens to wash them. After re-making their beds with their clean sheets and blankets washed in Tide plus Febreze, they can't wait to snuggle up under the covers, its nearly impossible to to keep them out of bed long enough to finish making it! Thank you tide for the Wonderful product. I think that, as my girls get older, and use this in their homes, it will bring back great memories of their childhood!
I received a free sample of the Sport variety a while back. Being the poor (ahem, frugal) college student I am, I've been using whatever has been on sale at the store. When I found my little sample again, I decided to give it a go. I didn't really notice anything special at first- my clothes don't typically get really dirty or stained- but when I put on my pjs, I really noticed the scent in my t-shirt. It's amazing! And my clothes are still smelling fresh today. I will definitely be purchasing Tide with Febreze from now on :)
My family loves the Tide with the lavendar scent, or as we call it, "Tide with the purple cap". We wouldn't use anything else. One time wea friend recommended a brand that was a couple dollars cheaper. She said it worked just as well as Tide, so I tried it to see. IT WASN'T EVEN CLOSE! My husband noticed the minute his clothes came out of the dryer. The scent wasn't the only thing that was wrong. His clothes still had stains on them. He's a forest ranger and he can get clothes pretty dirty. Tide gets it out the first time, every time. Besides its strength, the scent keeps the bedroom linens smelling nice all week. I gave my bargain brand to the person who recommended it and got my Tide back. We won't ever go back to anything else!
This product costs a bit more but is well worth the price. With a house full of athletic teenagers, it makes my job much more doable.
With a husband who works construction and 2 teenage daughters active in sports, it was hard to find a product that would not only get out dirt but also odors. Once we tried Tide plus Febreze SPORT with the Active Fresh Scent we were hooked. It does cost a little bit more but is so worth it!! I truly believe this is the best product out there right now!! I would (and have) highly recommend it!
My husband operates a poultry farm. I was using bleach on all his clothes just to remove the odor from his clothes. Then I tried Tide with Febreze and it Works Great! no more using bleach to help with the odors, just the Tide works wonderfully.Thanks Tide!!
My husband recently purchased this product - HE Sport with Febreze (black cap). After a couple of loads of laundry, our clothes started to smell terrible. I thought that perhaps our front loading machine had retained some mold from washing towels. No such luck. After cleaning with Affresh, Borax, Vinegar, the smell remained. I noticed while doing hot yoga, what I thought to be body odor! I was embarassed as I never thought it could be the detergent. I couldn't take it anymore since now our towels and bed linens were stinking too. I went back to our old Tide HE and the smell disappeared. I don't usually write reviews good or bad, but thought it imperative that somebody know how bad this stuff smells. Be glad you can't find it in the store. You aren't missing anything.
I grew up always using Tide only. It was versatile enough to use in the laundry, cleaning the floors and washing dishes. This new product with Febreze is unbeatable. Caring for an elderly parent, with occasional accidents, this product is a Godsend. Not even a hint of a problem after it's laundered. Anyone with children, pets or anyone who is subject to accidents should use this.
My husband just started working at a company that treats railroad ties, so he comes home smelling like creosote (yuck!). Tide Sport takes the odors away!
Since we have been using Tide my husband actually told me the clothes are getting cleaner, so no more CHEAP detergents for me,The freshness and smell are vedry pleasurable.Thaks again TIDE
Love the way this detergent smells, and it has great cleaning power. The fragrance actually spreads in the area my washer/dryer is, so it's like getting a little air freshener as well!
I normally buy cheap laundry detergent. Since we move to a house, I start using tide HE liquid detergent. I totally loved it! I use only the measurement on the bottle cap. it still amaze me with that little amount of detergent can clean the entire load of clothes. We have baby and his "like mustard stain" waste can't get off easily just by regular washing. I wash the clothes with other detergent by hand and I still see the stain. When I put on the laundry machine using tide, everything come clean like new!The funny things is when we purchase the house, it has some kind of nice smell. we asked the seller what kind of air freshener he used. Nothing. he never used any kind of air freshener. We just finally realized that the smell must come from this detergent... what a nice addition...
I've read hundreds of product reviews for various items but have never written one. After using this product, I was obligated to write my first one. I switched to this product from a leading competitor that I have been using for years after a recent visit to a friend's house. My friend's linens smelled so clean and wonderful -- she said she used Tide. I bought this product and have been thoroughly pleased with the fresh fragrance it gives my clothes. Not only does this product make my clothes smell heavenly, but it has restored the whiteness of my husband's t-shirts. I haven't seen his shirts look so white since the day they came out of the package! Awesome product! Job well done, Tide!!
As a female, city letter carrier, it is important to stay "so fresh and so clean clean". Thanks Tide for keeping me clean and smelling like a Lady.
Bought this to try on my husbands work clothes, he's in maintenance, and in the summer especially, they can really stink. First time I used it, he said his clothes smelled like bubble gum, and he never wanted to use anything else again. He started recommending it to everyone he worked with, made his buddies sniff his clothes, it was hilarious. It's the only thing we use now. Love the scent, love the product!
I LOVE THE SCENT OF THE TIDE WITH FEBREEZE. THE SPRING RENEWAL KIND WAS THE BEST ONE. I JUST LOVE THE WAY IT MADE MY CLOTHES SMELL. AWESOME PRODUCT!!!!!!
A great whitening product, smells good and better than any other version of Tide.
I usually buy Tide plus a touch of Downey and have been very satisfied. Recently I decided to try the Tide febreze SPORT(100 oz.). I am very disappointed in this purchase. I bought it to wash gym clothes for a fresher smell. I've used it twice and my clothes actually stink....they smell worse than before I washed them. I will continue to buy my usual Tide but never the SPORT again.
This is my favorite detergent for washing my family's clothes. Everyone is satisfied and I love having towels that smell good. Somehow, it starts the day nicely!
I just love the smell of the Seaside Fresh detergent... I use it every time I wash laundry!! It makes my clothes smell so good, with some other laundry detergents your clothes don't smell good after being washed.. With this detergent my clothes smell good even after being dried... I've used numerous brands of laundry detergent, this one is the best one I've found... I would recommend this product to anyone!!!
I also love the Febreze SPORT and was disappointed when I purchased a new HE machine that I was not able to use the SPORT scent for the HE.
TIDE he with Febreeze Sport is now my FAVORITE laundry detergent! I was a GAIN user for years, and have been converted! I'm not super crazy about the higher price, but it's worth it since I only have to wash those stinky clothes ONCE and not repeatedly to get the stink out!With a grubby hubby, a stinky teen and potty pants little ones, TIDE sport gets ALL the odors out with just one wash!I really miss their Deep Clean fragrance (that peppery smell was my favorite) and would love it if you could bring it back!Thanks TIDE, for your wonderful product!
TIDE he with Febreeze Sport is my FAVORITE laundry detergent!!! Love how fresh the clothes smell. It is finally available at the super store I shop at, only wish they carried a larger size--the biggest!
My son works in a restaurant. After trying MANY laundry products to remove that horrible "restaurant" smell from his work clothes, I purchased Tide with Febreze. The results are everything I hoped for. His clothes smell FRESH. A co-worker even commented, "You smell good."Thank you for developing this product. I LOVE IT!
I love Febreeze Sport. Now I own an HE washer. Febreeze Sport does not come in HE form.P&G : Please help!
I have been an avid Gain user for years until I tried Tide with Febreze....it gets rid of all types of smells. I have a teenager who plays alot of sports, and sometimes his sweaty clothes stay in his locker at school for days--they are disgusting!!! This is the only detergent I have found that removes ALL of the odor (no matter how putrid) the FIRST time. I have told everyone about this product. Thank you for Tide w/ Febreze!!!!!! :)
I love using Tide but have trouble finding HE in the powder. My grandmother used Tide, my mother used Tide and I've used for as long as I've washed clothes.
I have been using Gain for years and decided to buy Tide with Fabreze.... the smell is absolutely awesome and washing clothes with it is a pleasure.... I found something amazing which furthers my belief that Tide is the best, even clothes I washed in Gain smells of the Tide, just from hanging beside the Tide washed clothes in my closet.... the Tide spring & renewal is awesome....
After a few months of waiting, last week I found the seaside fresh at my grocery store I was so happy. When I washed my clothes with it they smelled terrific. I am so pleased with all three products in the Tide febreze collection and will buy these three Tide products most of the time. Tide is the best and I will continue to remain a faithful Tide customer. Keep up the good work Tide.
Okay, I used another liquid detergent with Febreze in it, and it worked all right. I got a sample in the mail so I tried Tide with Febreze because I wanted that smell of freshness and I was skeptical, but now Tide with Febreze Freshness Liquid is the ONLY liquid detergent I have bought in the last year. Not only does it deliver a clean smelling freshness, it cleans my clothes without fading or leaving spotting on them, and now they have the new Acti-lift, which gives me even more reason to use Tide! Tide is keeping me and my clothes happy, and to use something else is unthinkable.
I absolutely LOVE this new Tide with Fabreeze. Even my house smells good when they are in the dryer. And the sheets after washing them in Tide, it keeps smelling great days after I wash them. My husband is in construction, so you know he gets dirty. This new Tide gets them clean and he smells so nice, I have teased him that all the other fellas on the construction sight will notice how nice he smells. I dont think I would ever use anything ever again after using this product. I am completely sold. I love it, keep up the good work Tide.
I have always been a Tide user and will continue to do so but I can't stand the smell of the Spring & Renewal Tide. It stinks up my laundry room every time I use it and stays that way the whole day. It almost smells like dirty socks to me. Yuck!
I use Febreze Freshness to help clean my daughter's volleyball clothes. Sometimes they really could use something strong to penetrate all of the perspiration odor. So, I am happy to know about 'Tide Plus Febreze." It has truly been a life saver! Thanks.
Have tried every product available and nothing could get the smell completely out of my husband's workout clothes. This product does!!! Love it!
I love the smell of my freshly cleaned clothes and how they look. They are bright and fresh looking. I love tide products and have a been a loyal user for many years.
i've used Tide for so many years simply because it has always been the best available! bar none!
I love the clean fresh scent that Febreze leaves in my clean clothes. My grandmother, my mother, myself and my child are all tide users. We are a 4th generation tide family. I NEVER USE ANYTHING ELSE! LOVE IT
Love this product, but would like to have new scents like my favorite - Lavender Vanilla Comfort!
Who new that when I got married I would really be married to the washing machine? Because of Tide with Fabreeze that's 1 affair my husband is happy about. Using Tide with Fabreeze makes not only makes everything I wash smell like it was line dried in the fresh air(which we don't have much of in Brentwood- (I live 2 blocks from a White Castle), But it makes doing laundry a BREEZE. Using Tide I never have to worry about my laundry coming out clean but now I even stopped using fabric softener. I don't use my drier for much because I don't believe in frying to a crisp. Using Tide with Fabreeze I can smell the freshness as soon as I open the washing machine. Even my husband noticed when I had clothes drying on hangers he said,"what smells so good, did you get a new candle(only burn fabreeze)?" I told him, "no babe that's the laundry on the hangers in the bathroom." It literally permeates the whole 2800sqft house we have. We love it. I love how Tide cleans my laundry & adding Fabreeze to it makes everything smell better than ever. It was funny when I had asked him if his sweat shirt needed to be washed, he smelled it & said yea it doesn't smell like Fabreeze anymore. I used to have to wait til he wasn't looking or sleeping to wash his favorite sweats, shorts, hat etc. Now he hands them over willingly because they don't have that fabreeze freshness anymore as he puts it. In my opinion Tide made the clothes smell fresh & clean anyway, but by adding Fabreeze to it the product got better. Thank you for saving me time(no more fabric softener) & for making my life easier by not having to cop my husbands favorite things to wash them. Because I don't use the drier & I hang most everything on hangers to dry I am also freshening up my house @ the sametime- everytime I do laundry (which is constantly).Thanks again to Tide & P&G for taking a great product & making it even better. There's somethng to be said for being brand& product loyal. My only complaint is the pricing- it is kind of on the high side. But I guess like the saying goes, "you get what you pay for."Right? As far as cleanliness & freshness I don't have any complaints what so ever. I couldn't ask for a better product.
I must be honest and upfront I bought this item at first because I buy almost all Febreze Products. I'd never used Tide before but man was I amazed. Not only do my clothes come out clean and keep their color well, they smell fantastic! It is a strong scent the Tide smell mixed with Febreze so you really have to like it but I love it! If I could I'd marry this product. Sometimes I'll wash things that are clean just to smell the wonderful scent! What a great feeling crawling into bed of clean sheets with a heavenly smell.... puts me right to sleep!I think it goes without mentioning that I'd recommend this product to a friend.
Having washed clothes, using Tide products, for a huge family for years, I can honestly say "Tide" has helped me to have the cleanest appearing and nicest smelling clothes ever for my family. It made washing piles of laundry not an unpleasant chore.
Gets better with each load! I have used Tide all my life and it just gets better and better!
i have used both the tide w/bleach as well as the tide w/frebreze. I also used the new liquid tide,(I don't recall the exact name-its an all-inclusive" type. I found all the 3 tide products, as well as the tide booster powder product= to all be the best laundry detergents I have ever used. Stains,-even old stains-(I did pre-treat them-using the tide battery revolving stain brush dipped in liquid tide and then into the powder-tide w/bleach! ), all came out. the whites were whiter than i'ld seen in years. I am now a tide advocate and then some!
I always get complements on how fresh my clothes smell.
This product is fabulous, I even found my Husband using it, it smells so Good and Cleans Great. I won't use anything else.
I really have a hard time just finding anytide in He I would love to find it with Febreeze
I LOVE Tide plus Febreze! My clothes, linen, bedsheets, towels, etc keep that fresh scent for several days. I catch myself smelling my clothes and thinking, "Wow, this product works well!" Thanks for making a wonderful product!!!
other products you buy tou have to use twice the usual amount and it can not beat the performance of tid so why save less to pay more that is bassicaly what you are doing the tide will go 3 times longer then those cheaper brands it gives the freshness that is out of this world that lastest for days and days and the cleaning performance to me you can not beat i have used several different brands and they cannot add up to the value of tide my rating would have to be 10 on the tide
I have always loved Tide products. This is great. It just gets better and better. It smells great and it really get the job done.
Ever since I started using Tide with Febreze; my husband's work clothes have not had any oil, dirt, etc. odors. His clothes smell fresh and clean. I only use this product because it definitely works. I have told a lot of my friends and relatives, and even people in stores if they are by the soap products. They seem to trust my judgement.
I had my dogs out in the country and they cornered a skunk. Unfortunately I was downwind and ended up skunked too. Before I threw out my clothes I tried washing them in Tide with Fabreze. After one wash the smell, and it was some smell, was gone. I can't think of a better testimonial.
I always use Tide for laundry, but the smell of the Tide plus Febreze Freshness. is overwhelming. If you exercise and sweat while wearing these clothes the smell will gag you. I have had to dilute this detergent to use it.
Tide has alway been a Liquid Laundry Deterget I trust to clean my family's cloth and now Febreze added our cloth will smell Freeher.
I am a busy mom of 4 and am going to nursing school. Let me tell you, I am not the most attentive to stains right now. This leaves our clothes smelling great and it gets thoses unknown stains out. Love It !
I am in LOVE with Tide's Spring & Renewal Detergent and Softner! It is the only detergent that I will use.... I get tons of compliments on the way that my clothes smell! Try it out! :)
I have tried other sports detergents that promise to remove that post-workout odor only to be disappointed. This product works so well that even after 75 minutes of cardio, a yoga class, and some weight-training, my clothes still smell great.
My daughter and I are both very particular about the scents we use. We'll spend 20 minutes trying out different things to find a good one. This one is very good. Our only complaint is that we have an HE washer and we have trouble finding this scent in stock in the HE on a regular basis. Wish we could count on finding it more often.
I love Tide with Febreeze for HE machines, but would love to see the sport version in HE. I guess it hasn't come out yet?
THERE IS NOTHING BETTER THAN TIDE NO MATTER WHAT THEY ADD TO IT.
My daughters house caught fire and sustained heavy smoke damage. Tide with Febreze and a stain booster took the awful smell out of her clothes in one wash.
I have used tide for years, And I just simply love all of the products. And it leaves my clothes smelling great.
I have used Tide with fabreeze for a couple of years now. I have recommended it to my friends. (who by the way switched). I love the smell and it makes everything smell clean. When I get into bed or snuggle with a blanket it adds cozyness as well. LOVE IT!!!
Please ! If you do ANYthing with this,do something about the god awful stink of the liquid Tide ! It`s horrible,and everyone agrees
Its so nice to take clothes out of the drawer and have that fresh smell that seems to last all day.
I love the Tide with Febreze. All my laundry comes out fresh and clean. Everything has a wonderful scent. I have had my HE washer for over 8 years. At the time of purchase it was very difficult to find HE detergents. Tide has always been my favorite, and I am very happy to see more HE Tide Detergent's now available. If possible please make a larger size Tide/Febreze /HE. The 26 load doesn't last very long in our houshold. Excellent Product if you like keeping your clothes looking nice! Thank You for the HE availability!
I absolutely love this particular scent and it is so hard to find. I think it smells better than any of the others. Please don't tell me that they are going to not make it any more. Pleaseeeeeeee!
Im already using your products. But after seeing the Venus Williams spot on TV you have customer for life. I will be buying the Febreze Tide next time I shop. I also love how well the stain removing tablets work keep up the great work.
I have used almost everyone of Tide's laundry products and I am sold.......My Mother used Tide and I won't use anything else, my children use it too. It makes my laundry smell clean and fresh, everytime.
It's like having an 'old fashioned' sachet in my dresser drawers, everything smells fresh for a long time.
What an awesome product! I LOVE IT!! My clothes smell like they just were washed everyday!! My clothes feel clean with out feeling greasy like a softener can make them feel. Thanks Tide for making the best detergent out there!
I recently purchased 2Xultra Tide with Febreze (Meadows & Rain). Love the product, BUT before I could use the product, I could NOT get the lid off!! My husband tried without success! I had to bang the cap on the counter, then my husband got it off, with much effort! How would someone with poor grip or an elderly person get the lid off? This might affect whether I would buy the product again, even though I love the product! The numbers stamped on the lid are: 934317, then under that is 020616. Thank you for listening!
I have had the task of writing your company a letter, concerning container size of Tide HE. The bottle was too tall to fit in my LG pedestal storage beneath my high efficiency washer. I had to place the bottle of Tide HE on it's side, making a mess every time I poured it out. I found this odd since this specific brand of Tide was made for such machines.After purchasing a new bottle of Tide HE, I was happy to see that the size of the bottle has changed and now fits beneath my washer. You have saved me a letter ... except this one to thank you! Thanks so much for accommodating us HE machine, pedestal users. It's the little things that make my day brighter! :)
I grew up with my mom using Tide and the scent always reminded me of childhood and home.I began using Febreze in my husband's loads of uniforms as soon as it was on the market.To now have both available in one liquid is time and money saving.My husband has passed away but washing my clothes and bedding in Tide with Febreze makes it seem he is hugging me all the time!
I love this stuff! Unlike so many other scented laundry cleaners or fabric softeners, this stuff really does last! There is nothing better than feeling like your inside of a commercial, picking up your favorite sweater and having it smell wonderful *days* after you last washed it! Keep up the good work, Tide!
very watery, not like other products for HE machines. Will not purchase again.
I am allergic to all brands of laundry detergent.... EXCEPT Tide. I'm so glad they have this scent. I don't have to use softner or anything because my clothes come out smelling awesome everytime. I found the larger size (52 loads) once and I can't remember where, so now I'm stuck getting the 26 loads bottle. I wish I remembered where!!!!!
I am very sensitive to perfumes but this scent is fabulous! Having the febreze in the soap is a great idea.
I love Tide with Lavender but with Febreze it smells like medicine! Take the Febreze out and just make it with Lavender scent.Won't buy this again sorry
I have well water at my house. Our water tends to go through cycles when it comes to the smell of it. If I do the laundry during one of the "smelly" times, I can tell you that NOTHING can make my laundry smell good EXCEPT Tide with Febreze! I get comments on how good it smells when I use it! I don't buy anything else!
I LOVE this product.. I try to do a load of laundry a day just so I can smell it! I dont know what I would do if you ever stopped selling it! LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!!!!!!
I had used other detergents for years and added frebreeze to my laundry, but when Tide with Frebreeze came out all that changed. I have been using Tide with Frebreeze since it's release and we have always had people tell us how clean and fresh our clothes (including my oldest son's sweaty gym clothes) smell when we first arrive somewhere. We have friends remark that items washed in your detergent smell like they just come out of the dryer, I haven't the heart to tell them they were wash in some cases weeks ago. No matter where I work on my sales route and what kinds of smells get embedded in my clothes(smoke mostly), I know one wash with Tide with Frebreeze will get it out and make everything smell fresh for a long time.Thanks for make fresh clean laundry easy to achieve.
I started using this product a little over a year ago. And I've been hooked ever since! I'm not picky on which scent and this is another one that works well in cold water as well.
i love the way tide febreze smell it just makes you feel good all over and the way the world is now that is a poisitive thing.
I think this is causing issues with my LG Tromm washers, too many suds.
I simply love this detergent! It cleans my clothes and leaves a lasting clean scent! I only wish Tide sold it in the jumbo size!
I love this product. It smells great, I like to use it on my towels, sheets, and workout clothes that I don't use fabric softener on because it leaves a great scent. The only problem is I can't find it anywhere?
Product makes blue spots on clothes and it smell digusting.
This was my favorite product until they stopped making the green lable rain scent. The purple is horrid.Why did you stop making it?
I love Tide with Febreze. However, like one of the other reviewers, I really miss the Citrus and Light Scent! I am not a big fan of floral type scents, so the Citrus one was perfect! There should be another scent like that, and the product will be even more perfect than it already is!
THE FIRST TIME I TRIED IT...I WAS HOOKED AND WILL NEVER CHANGE USING TIDE WITH FABREEZE!!!!!!
While I like both Febreze Tide products that are offered, I miss the 'Citrus and Light' scent. I realize that companies have to trim down products that don't sell very well, but at least at the laundromat I use, there are many, many upset people because of the discontinuation of this product. I would be very happy if you brought 'Citrus and Light' back to the market. If you introduce a product, consider the people who have already 'adapted' the product into their lives before yanking it from the market.Thank You
I bought front loaders almost a year ago, had never used tide before ...however with the front loaders I decided to try Tide HE Febreze Spring & Renewal as I loved the scent while at the store. I've been dedicated to it ever since. My clothes are so clean and smell so good! I would really like to see it available in a larger container, I live miles outof town and having to gather many smaller containers is a little inconvienient. If you decide to make this product available in a larger container and in Canada, please let me know...I'll be all over it!!thanks!!!
THIS IS THE ONLY DETERGENT I BUY, IT WORKS GREAT FOR THE HOUSE HOLD USE TOO I USE IT FOR MY FLOORS,BATHROOM, AND CLEAN THE COUNTERS. EVERYONE LOVES THE SMELL IN MY HOME. ALSO MY HUSBAND HAS BAD SINUS AND THIS DOES NOT MAKE HIM SNEEZ OR BREAKOUT. THANK YOU.. (COUPONS WOULD BE GREAT)
I have tried them all, even in the old top loaders and now the new front loaders. I do have to say the Tide with Febreeze Spring & Renewal dowa not compare to any other types or brands as far and how well it cleans you laundry and how great your laundry feels and smells after being washed using Tide with Febreeze Spring and Renewal. The problem I have is I cannot find the Tide with Febreeze Spring and Renew in the large bottles that are HE, I know you make it because I found it in a 26 load bottle. I need to get this in a 78 load size bottle or more. Please let me know where I can get the large bottle somewhere near me. I live in zip code 77090.
Tide with Febreze Freshness smells wonderful from start to finish. Our towels smell beautiful, the blankets smell fresh and clean, and our pajamas are so very snuggly with the soft, sweet smell.I love the Bounce with Febreze as well.
This detergent is wonderful. Like the other reviewers, it is very difficult to find this product. I would love to see it in the larger size. The small 50 oz and 100 oz, do not cut it. Please consider your consumers feedback and start producing it in a larger size.
I love the Tide with Febreze, before I committed to buying my new washer/dryer set I made sure my local store carried it in the HE type. But I am dissappointed that I have to buy it in the little bottle, PLEASE start selling it in the BIG bottle with the dispenser on the front of it!!!!
i love this product i refuse to use anything but this to wash my clothes. it also leaves a nice scent on my clothes without being too much or overpowering. this is good cause im allergic to some scents or my allergies are trigger if the scent it really strong.i love this and would recommend it to anyone its amazing :]
I love this scent!! I am always getting compliments from my friends and coworkers about how good my clothes always smell. I pair it with Downy with Febreeze and Bounce with Febreeze for the extra scent. My clothes always come out smelling and looking great. I refuse to buy anything else. Keep up the great work!!
This product smells absolutely wonderful. The bath towels and your clothes have a clean smell that lasts longer than any other detergent I have ever used. I am hooked for life on this product. I will never use another laundry detergent. It may cost a little bit more than the cheaper brands, but its well worth it.
I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS PRODUCT. I WISH THERE WERE BIGGER SIZES. THE SMELL IS WONDERFUL AND I LOVE THAT THE SCENT DOESN'T LEAVE MY CLOTHES. I NEED THE HE FOR MY WASHER HOWEVER IT IS SO DIFFICULT TO FIND IT AND IT IS NEVER THE BIG ONE I CAN ONLY FIND IT IN SMALL SIZES. I DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT.
We tried this product and love it. I love the way it smells and cleans our clothes. Tide has always been my detergent of choice.Just need to get it in bigger bottles.
The febreze compliments the cleaning power of Tide. It not only makes my clothes smell wonderful but it leaves my front-loading washing machine spring fresh. I wouldn't use any other product.
I heard from my parents about this product but always brought the cheaper detergents well I finally decided to squeeze it in the budget and I must say I will never use any other product again , My clothes smell very fresh and clean and all the stains are gone , This is the best product ever !! I love it and will always buy for now on ,Thank you Tide
I bought this for the first time and used it as i thot Tide is a good brand.. but it smells yuck..just feel like vomiting after washing my clothes..cant stand the smell..just gonna throw this yuck and smelly detergent..
The Best @ Washing
I really like the scent of this detergent and it works well for getting light- and medium- tough stains out on its own. Only thing: it does nothing for wrinkles, you need a fabric softener or dryer sheets for that.
i love tide i wish it would make more suds though if it did it would be a 5 star product/
TIDE IS GOOD. TIDE ALWAYS HAS BEEN GOOD. IT IS THE ONLY LAUNDRY SOAP PRODUCT THAT YOU ACTUALLY DO NOT NEED MORE THAN THE CAP FULL TO DO A LOAD. I WORKED IN MACHINE SHOPS FOR YEARS BUT TIDE ALWAYS CAME THROUGH. I WAS RECENTLY TAKING CARE OF MY SICK MONEY. ANY MESS THIS WILL CLEAN UP.AND THE SMELL AFTERWARDS IS DELIGHTFUL. IT LASTS AND LASTS SO WHEN YOU PULL YOUR FAVORITE NUGHTY OUT OF THE DRAWER IT SMELLS LIKE IT WAS JUST WASHED. AND IT IS A GREAT SMELL..CLEAN AND FRESH SMELL. I DO NOT WANT MY CLOTHES SMELLING LIKE LAVENDER OR FRUIT..OR EVEN HAWAIIAN! I WANT THAT NICE FRESH CLEAN SMELL!....AHHHH
Well being deployed to Kenya, and not having the access of good that we have back in the US, kind of makes it hard to enjoy. so what better way to make it a well worth deployment than by using product that we are used to back home..so over all Im satisfy on the product and Walmart on being able to ship to us armforces personel
Can't go wrong with this one. Overall great product. I will purchase again.
I was excited to try a product that is supposed to work well with workout clothes. Being a long distance runner, clothes smell after time. Since the first use of this product in a Front Loader, my new washing machine reeks of order and mildew-type smell and my clothes smell horrible and have since been trying to wash out the smell with a different detergent. What the heck??? If I left them in the machine for even an hour after washer was finished, I had to rewash my clothes. I have tried a few more times with the same result. Very disappointed, as I bought two bottles and this stuff isn't exactly cheap. I now have to buy the washing machine cleaner. Let's hope that this Tide product lives up to it's expectations!!Not sure how others are getting good results from this product, unless top loaders are getting different result!
I have used Tide detergent all my life and have not found anything else to compare it to. Its the best.
THE FRAGENCE IN THIS TIDE SEEMS TO LAST LONG AFTER THE WASH IS DONE. IT CLEANS WELL ON THE RECOMMENDED AMOUNT. DOES NOT FADE COLORS. SEEMS TO TAKE CARE OF STAINS AND THE EXTRA DIRTY AS WELL.
This product is worth the higher price -it smells wonderful and feels like my clothes are even cleaner and fresher --- highly recomment
THE BEST laundry detergent Scent EVER! We all know that TIDE is the BEST Detergent for getting your clothes clean- More pricey but you get what you pay for. Stains Gone- Spills Out- and now Everything smells Wonderful TOO! Tide Febreze Sport Smells Incredibly Fresh & Sweet and STAYS Fresh for WEEKS! WOW! I must tell YOU how fabulous the scent of this laundry detergent REALLY is! My Orangle Bottle Miracle leaves the clothes, sheets, blankets, towels, everything it touches, FRESH for WEEKS after washing. I have NEVER scene anything like it!! I am a smoker yet because of Tide Febreze Sport you would NEVER know it. My clothes smell fabulous and fresh. I have noticed that even when I grab a shirt or a towel that was laundered weeks ago, it will STILL smell freshly laundered- You will want to Suck the smell up your nose fresh! YOUR Gonna LOVE this. TRY IT- PLease YOU WILL LOVE IT! I will NEVER use ANYTHING else EVER again! FOR REAL. #1 Cant live without product. Thanks Tide!
The scent is strong but does smell great! It also cleans very well.
My honey works in the garage a lot, and his clothes always end up smelling like oil/grease/gas. I was able to get them clean with other Tide products, but that "car" smell always lingered...but, no more! Smells fresh and clean! (I think the people saying it smells like cat urine and/or mildew need to clean their HE washers and remember to leave the door open after using!) Could you please change the color of the cap, though? I can't see the correct measurement very well in a black cap! :)
Thought I'd try this on my gym cloths and jeans since both seem to retain odor. Smell of product is OK, but it's way too thick. Continually clogs my liquid dispenser on my HE front loader. So bad to the point, I'm returning it to the store for exchange on a normal Tide product. I've always used Tide, but may start looking at other brands with this experience. Don't waste money on this.
My husband works out everyday and eventually the material that workout clothes are made of retain odor. My other brand of detergent works fine for our regular laundry, but I trusted the Tide name so much that I bought this brand in the 200 oz size at a wholesale club. I was EXTREMELY disappointed! The clothes came out with a terrible odor that was extremely difficult to get out. I actually had to run my HE machine with just a few items instead of a full load and a full cup of detergent. A waste of time and money!
I have been a Tide user for 20+ years. Recently, I purchased a new washing machine that requires HE detergent. Of course, I purchased Tide HE. It is the only thing I use and is great for my sensitive nose! Unfortunately, the scent is so strong with this detergent, I can't use it. I washed one load of clothes and have had a headache since. The scent is all over my house. I will continue to purchase Tide if it is unscented.
I love the scent and cleaning ability of this product! Just one problem....I just had to buy a new washer, and it's an HE....I cannot find the HE version of this detergent in the stores that are local to me :( So, I had to go back to the regular-works well but doesn't smell as nice Tide with Bleach Alternative :( But, I'll keep on looking! Thanks for a great product!
I would not recommend this product to anyone who does not like perfume smells on their clothes, this product leaves an exceptionally strong aftersmell that is even hard to wash out a second time. Just like the name, it has a very strong Fabreeze scent...so you can smell like grandmas litter box closet out on trails too.
I bought this product because my daughter plays softball and her uniforms and practice clothes get extremely stinky. The product smells good in the bottle, so I was really surprised when the clothes and front loading machine stunk after I used it. The clothes almost smelled worse after I washed them, kind of like a mildewy/urine scent that is hard to describe. I have tried to use this product on several loads and have had the same outcome. So disappointed in this product because all of the other Tide products I've tried have been very high quality. Thankfully the Tide Washing Machine Cleaner made my machine smell good again; and I have switched back to the Clean Breeze scented Tide that makes my clothes smell clean and fresh. I actually came to the website to read other people's reviews to see if they have encountered the same problem that I did. Apparently I'm not the only one who thinks that it makes clothes smell terrible. I feel like I wasted my money on this product.
Bought this detergent yesterday. Did five loads of laundry today.....all of them smell like cat urine. Now I'm stuck with a large amount of this liquid that I won't be using again!
This gets all the stains and smells out, and I LOVE the sport scent!
My boyfriend of 5 years has very a strong b.o. Ive tried everything from washing laundry with baking soda to oxi-clean, the smell still stayed. Now that I have bought this new HE washing machine it was time to switch our detergent.I was so happy when Tide plus febreze freshness along with the tide in wash booster packs removed all the smell from his clothes. He says "It smells like a girl, but that's good!" Thank u tide for making a great product. I also use both to wash my puppy blankets.. There are no unwanted sents from her kennel. thanks again.
I have always used tide and now will search all over for Tide Sport!!! I run and my husband plays softball, Tide Sport is all we use.
As an Athlete, my sports clothes smell pretty sweaty after a session in the 100+ degree Texas weather! Tide Sport makes my clothes smell fresh again! It smells really good and it gets ride of the stinky sweat! It's my favorite detergent!
Best detergent I have ever bought that totally got rid of my son's smelly socks!!!!
I have used Tide for many years and never had a problem with the way it cleans or smells. This Tide with Febreze is the worst smelling detergent I have ever used and would never recommend it. It makes my clothes smell like they were in the gym bag for months, even those that were never sweaty. Thumbs down!
I have two very active teenagers. They are in many sports, dance, and cheer. This works great on all our clothes. I also have people ask me what fragrance I am wearing. When I tell them what it is. They are shocked and say they are going to try this product. I have always used Tide. We don't buy anything else. It works great. Thanks for making this wonderful product.
I am a loyal Tide fan, for years. Had to return this one. The irritating smell lingers for weeks. The "Original" version is also heavily scented. Though the scentless Tide HE "Free +Gentle" is hard to find in stores, will keep up the search. No added scent would be better by far.
Tide...thank you for this product. I love the smell it leaves in my clothes and it leaves the washing machine smelling fresh as well.
The Febreze scent is too strong. Yes, it does SEEM to remove the odor from all our running gear, but is it really just covering it up? My husband, who is constantly training for marathons, has asked me to stop using Sport HE. I have always used Tide products so I was very disappointed when I found this product sorely lacking. Too be honest, I don't Febreze added to any product I've tried.
I have four active children and a husband that exercises a lot. I am ALWAYS doing laundry. So far the "Sport" detergent seems to help with the stale odors. I really like the "Sport" component, but I am not thrilled about the scent. I really wish you would offer it in the Mountain Spring scent! It would also help if you offered larger containers.
I love Tide. Thought I would give the sport a try because of my 9 and 10 year old. My clothes came out smelling sour. At first I thought I let them sit too long in the washer, so I washed again. But still the same. Seriously, smells sour!!!!
This is my absolute favorite detergent. I have always used tide but never really fell in love with a certain smell until Febreeze sport. I work outside and pesticide residue gets on my clothes a lot and are really hard to get rid of the odor. I seen this product tried it and have never went back to any other fragerance. I love getting my laundry out of the washer and smelling it, and not the odors that I accumulate over the course of the day.
I've been a Tide user for years and am so happy that there is now a detergent that still cleans as well as it has from grass stains to mud but now brings a great fresh scent without being overpowering. The last thing my son wants is to smell "like a girl" but the Febreze Sport has a nice clean scent. I recommend this to any one. The HE is a little difficult to find at times so we buy what we can. Please keep this product around! We love it, love it, love it!
I have a 13yr old and 9 yr old boy, not to mention my husband! I love this sport detergent. It makes my kids clothes smell great instead of like they just got done playing basketball or baseball. My only problem is everywhere doesn't carry it so I pretty much buy out the one store in town that does! My kids even noticed I changed from the regular HE tide to this sport one!!
My family LOVES Tide. I would always purchase Original or April Fresh. Since you have added Sports to the collection, that is the only one for us. IWhen I go to purchase laundry detergent if iSports is not avalible I will travel to another store until I find it. When my son brings his clothes home to wash I would have to wash his socks twice. Tide, I would like to thank you. Now the smell of my laundry is breath taking. Would it ever be availble in a larger size?
I love this detergent. I wash my fitness clothes with it and they smell great afterwards.
I love Tide, but this Sport HE Liquid Laudry Detergent has a horrible smell.
I have been waiting for this formula to come out since I saw it for the "regular" washers. I usually get a "sour" smell from my cold water formula but since my first load with febreze sport I love doing laundry again.
I always had problems with sweat smell in my clothes and used to throw them out because I couldn't get rid of the smell. I tried this product and I was in awe.... even old smell came out after a few washes.. and now ther is now smelly problem anymore... thank you Tide!!!
I have teenagers who come home with strong orders in their clothes. I purchased Tide sport and all I can say is OMG it did the job. The smell is great and it gets out stains. Do not change.
This is the only detergent I have found to take the smell out of anything!!!! My husband works construction and comes home smelling like fuel everyday and in one wash it's gone. I have also like everyone left the towels in the washer to long and soured them but after washing them in this they smell great. I can only hope they keep this scent forever!!!!!
This is the first detergent I have found that not only works great on clothing, but also for washing cloth diapers. It even works great with our hard water, which has always been a challenge.
We operate a cattle ranch in south dakota and my husbands clothes get the worst kind of dirt and grime on them. Tide does a remarkable job on getting his clothes sparkling clean! i love you Tide!!!
I just purchased this product for my RV combo unit. This product doesn't have any dyes and leaves the clothes fresh and clean. I only need 1 Tablespoon of the product and the lid does not include that measurement so I used one of my measuring spoons - an added measuring line on the lid would be nice.
this is the only detergent i will use, but all stores still donot have it, the same is true for downey free or else it's the wrong size.. There is no offensive perfumes and it does not irratate my sensive skin.
Tide is the ONLY Laundry Detergent I use, and have used for many years. I bought a new washer which requires "HE" detergent, so I switched from regular tide, and am very happy with the HE Free & Gentle. I have allergies, and with this product, I have no surprises, while enjoying a clean and fresh laundry.
this product is good for sensitive skin. But is poor in cleaning dirt and grease. my husband has sensitive skin and works in grease and oil. we purchased this product because we just bought a front load machine. i will not purchase it again.
After Katrina we rebuilt and moved in with all new appliances. Since May of 2007 we have been using only Tide HE Free. The detergent works great, but...............the last time I went to buy it, the only size available was the "exta large" 150 ounce size. I didn't mind buying that much but I really, really, really dislike the container. It has to be turned on its side to dispense the detergent, it drips and then there is no where to put the cup. Sometimes you can have too much of a good thing! I won't buy this size again and will try another brand if another size is not available where I shop.
Good soap for the money. Just wish they came in a larger box
I've got allergies to fragrances. I started using Tide HE Free per doctor's orders. Thank goodness for TideHE Free.
I was recently diagnosed with allergies to several ingredients that are found in personal care and cleaning products. I have been frustrated to not be able to find an ingredient list on this product. It is not on the package, nor can I find it on your website. There is no way to know if your detergent is contributing to my severe allergic reaction. You call this product "Free" but without listing what is in it, there's no way to know what you are actually coming in contact with.
I have used Tide Free ever since it was introduced. My laundry comes out clean and smelling fresh. No perfume. I wish other Tide products would be offered without fragrance, especially the cold water version.
Last year we bought our front load HE washer. But I paniced when I found out that, at that time, Dreft was not available for HE washers. I searched the net and stores only to find two choices for sensitive skin. I hoped it would be okay for my super-sensitive baby's skin. The All free and clear still gave my son a rash everywhere his clothes touched. The Tide free and clear has worked with no problems. In fact, I wash all of our clothes in this now. No more buying Dreft for baby,and regular for us. I wish it wear a little easier to find and a little easier on the pocket book.
I found that this product, Tide Free for my He machine is the best for my family. We seem to have allergies to lots of things, but the Tide Free never causes us any problems and gets our clothes sparkling clean!
My mother has used Tide since the 50's. I tried other brands, but quickly found my clothes dingy, or not clean, and had skin irritation. I have used Tide all my life, and I will continue to use it for the rest of my life. Further, I use the unscented powder, which is the best for me, I have no skin irritation. My dogs like their bed clothes washed in it because there is no perfume smell. I also use Downy unscented always. Tide, and Downy rock!
This works great for kids that have Excema or any skin problems, I have been using this product for 4 months it works great. Thanks Tide my daughter is very happy !!
I have tried them all,but I will always come back to TIDE.I am a beliver now
I have used Tide Coldwater for years. After purchase of a new washing machine I needed the HE version of this product. Cleans very well in cold water.
For some reason I can't find coldwater 2x anymore. I was hoping walmart had it, and obviously in the name it is 2x. However, I received regular coldwater. Still washes well, and maybe the coldwater and coldwater 2x ultra may in fact be the same thing, I still wanted the ultra 2x. No walmarts near me, so shipping back three of these would've been a hassle. Regardless, washing with coldwater is effective and saves on heating bills!
I was so excited to use this because I've had bad luck with getting cold water to actually clean, but this detergent do any better than regular detergent. I'm not talking about stains either, just normal wear smells--like underarms, etc. :(
I really love the Mountain Spring scent of Tide. It is less harsh than the Fresh Scent, which I really dislike. But I wish the local stores around where I live carried the Mountain Spring in the very big jug. The one with a pour spout. They do not carry it here, and I do not even know if Tide makes Mountain Spring in that size. All I can ever find in the large size is the Fresh Scent, So I always have to buy the small jugs of Mountain Spring. Otherwise this product is amazing, and I will not use anything else ever!
My whole point of a coldwater detergent is to wash knit tops so they don't fade or shrink. I placed the detergent in the washing machine before adding my clothes. One of my light grey shirts touched the detergent, and now the areas of contact are pink! The shirt is ruined. No more Tide for me.
I love Tide Coldwater. I've been using it for quite sometime. As soon as it was available on the selves to purchase. Our clothes are so clean and fresh smelling. The Coldwater Tide is just as effective cleaning our clothes as any of the other Tide Laundry Detergents. Economically it's a good value. I'm going to continue to use Tide because it's the best product to buy.
I just found out about Tide Coldwater, which sounds great. I do all my laundry in an HE front-loader on either the 60°F or 95°F setting, and would be happy to have a detergent designed for that. But I can't stand the scents used in most detergents -- I always get unscented... and Tide Coldwater isn't available in unscented HE. Oh well.
So I have always been a Gain Gal But considering I have the Tide Pen and the Stain booster I purchased the ColdWater Detergent. It smells AWFUL. All my clothes Smell like they have been sitting in a wet Basement. Yes that mildew smell... I cannot tell you how unhappy I was so, I washed them again and the smell became even stronger. I tried to return it to the supermarket i bought it from...no luck so now Im stuck with this stinky soap.SMH.. Thank you but no thank you tide
Tide Coldwater helps me reduce my energy bill. The only draw back is it's hard to find in my area. I hope this will change as more people discover how well it works.
Although I sometimes have a hard time finding it in the stores, I find that my clothes are cleaner and my whites are MUCH whiter than any other product. I love it!
My son is a mechanic, his first job,anyway he comes home with black motor oil on his jeans daily. I put tide on them in the am and wash them and lunch and they look new again. I was shocked the first time. He could care less, of course, but mom does. Thank you Tide Coldwater for making a mom proud. It also saves money and the environment. Can't beat it in anyway.
I really love this product. I tend to get stains on my clothes and I get messy easily, so it's great to have a laundry detergent that not only gets my clothes clean, but also saves me some money on m energy bills. Keep up the good work, Tide!
We have a well and discovered that Cold Water Tide works the best for us. We don't use warm or hot water to wash our clothes and well water is much colder so that other detergents just can't compete.
We Love tide,have tried other products has never happy, i always use tide,clorox bleach & downy. If u use cold water,will it still disnefect your whites ?
I have tried other laundry products always come back to Tide Coldwater. I refuse to use warm or hot water for my laundry and Tide Coldwater is the only product I have been able to find that will clean well with cold water washing.
Really not happy with Tide Coldwater. Love the smell but it did no better than regular detergent in cold water. My 3 year old had ketchup on his shirt and even after soaking the whole load for 30 minutes it was still there. I think I'll stick with a less expensive detergent and just pretreat the ocassional spot.
I will be 60 this year and I have always had a fetish: I LOVE perfectly clean clothes. I grew up using Tide and it worked so great that I have used it forever. This year consumer reports said Tide Coldwater Liquid was the best product at the best price. then added: if it cleans this great in cold water, imagine how it will clean in other temperatures. (ps I've tested all products...I love Tide! thank you)
Absolutely the BEST cold water detergent on the market. I've tried many different brands throughout my 45 years of marriage but have always returned to Tide. Now I've got my adult children all using it b/c with Tide, there's never a need to second wash items b/c dirt and stains don't come out. Does the job the first time. Makes my life easier and my wash day shorter (which used to be everyday when my 4 kids were growing up).
thanks for staining blue spots on clothes for my science fair project :)
I started using Tide for cold water when my daughter told me how much she loved it. I buy it all the time now. The frangrance is light and amazing, I fing myself smelling my clothes as I wear them! And my clothes come out clean! The only thing i want from Tide is a coupon for it!
i am really unhappy with the tide these days i have had several items of clothing ruined from the detergent leaving blue spots all over them especially the lighter clothes a big dissapointment for me and i have been loyal to tide for 30yrs
I bought Tide Coldwater for my dark clothes as I am a freak about maintaining my colors for as long as possible. I am the type of person that seperates all colors pinks, reds, blues...etc. I only use Tide Coldwater on anything with color and I love it. I also have very sensitive skin and have been using the Mountain Spring without any issues though I am going to try the Free now that its available. Thank you Tide for saving my darks and saving me money!
I was a loyal customer of the Original Tide for Coldwater (Not acti lift cold water) but due to not being able to find the original Tide for Coldwater I chaged to the one with Acti Lift. I do not like it. When I used Acti Lift Tide it ruined my clothes with streaks of stains like bleach stains. I continue to look for the original Tide for Coldwater but realize that you have discontinued making it. I would really like to see you bring back the ORIGINAL TIDE FOR COLD WATER without the Acti Lift.
I had not been a Tide consumer until I tried the 2x Ultra coldwater based on the Consumer Rpts review. I absolutely loved this detergent, it made me a Tide lover! Please bring it back to market... I have moved on to Era's 2x ultra product.
these changes to double and triple strength are driving me crazy. you can't easily see the measuring lines on the cup so we end up using too much. and everything has sticky dribbles on the top of my washer. just reduice this stuff to tablets: 1 for small load, 2 for med, 3 for large. cheaper shpping and less confusion.
The coldwater Tide is very nice. Anything to save money. But, someone said they did not like the Mountain Spring, I love how it makes my clothes smell, but I use Downey with it. The two together make a wonderful clean smell.
Tide has been my choice of washing soap for years and I find that the product is continually being upgraded to my advantage. I use the cold water product and this allows me to help conserve on my water and electricity bill. I am pleased with the scent that is left in my clothes and they always look great.
The Mountain Spring detergent smells horrible. All of my clothes smell like they were left in the washer wet for a few days.
I love the "fresh" scent, but wow the Mountain Spring S-T-I-N-K-S! Unless you love a detergent that smells like some guy dumped a bottle of his cologne in it, don't buy the Mountain Spring!
I have used Cheer and Era for years and really like them both. I bought 1 bottle of Tide Coldwater to try and several of the other brands I use as I do over 100 loads of laundry a month. I LOVED the Tide. It works great, I don't have to use as much to have clean cloths and my family and I LOVE the smell! When you pull a bath towel out of the linen closet it smells so refreshing you can't help but sniff the towels each time you get one out! But It's not a strong or overwhelming smell, even for the asthmatics in the house. After years of being faithful to Cheer and Era, I've made the change and don't regret it.
Tide cold water may cost more than bargain brands but the money saved on electricity by using cold water and the money saved not having to rewash everything to get it clean or replace it because of the stains makes it a bargain. We have a 4 year old daughter and a 3 year old granddaughter and a 1 year old grandson and the three of them make Tide cold water a great bargain!! Oh yea, we are on a well and Tide cold water keeps them from being dingy!
This is the only product on the market that will truly get your clothes clean in cold water. I was already a tide user and have been for years I have gotten so many friends and family to use this product with electricity so high these days I can save money and know that my clothes are clean and at a good price. There must be alot of fans for this, I can never find it in the original scent and sometimes I cant find it at all.
Cold water only !!!! Works great. The most noticable difference is the brightness of colors. Keep it up P&G ----
I have never used anything other than Tide. I love the coldwater and have been using it for sometime. I sent my boyfriend to the store this time and not realizing there was a difference, he bought the "Mountain Spring" scent. It is by far the worst smelling detergent I have ever smelled! I did not realize it until I pulled my comforter out of the dryer. It smells like old cheap cologne! The smell it overbearing and takes your breathe away. It still lingers in the dryer. I am hoping the store will exchange it for the "fresh scent", if not I will be stuck with a full bottle that I will never use. I would definitely recommend the coldwater tide but only the "fresh scent" do your self a favor and DO NOT buy the “Mountain Spring” scent!!
this product works very well in cold water, witch we us all the time.
I love this detergent. I recommend it to friends and family. My mom is buying it now. The cleaning power and great fresh scent. I love the fact that I can save money and get clean clothes at the same time.
I love this new Tide Coldwater. It works much better than regular tide when using coldwater to wash with. I like to team it up with clorox coldwater bleach for my whites!!! Its the GREATEST!!!
I was taught how to do laundry when I was 8years old. We always used TIDE. When I Asked why, my foster mom said because it never fails me. Stains are gone and colors are Brite. So as I grew up I still use TIDE at age 52 and am loving it. Thank you.
This product simply doesn't work. Use regular Tide even in cold water! Regular Tide has always worked in cold water unlike Cold Water Tide. Go figure.
I love this because it does a great job getting clothes cleaning, while helping me save on energy bills and helps the environment by using the cold water!
I have to say this is emparrassing, I am having problems with Propane prices and I have my water heater on a 5 gallon propane tank that goes on the BBQ pit. If I use the hot water for my washer, I would go through propane in 2 or 3 days, therefore I wash all of my cloths in cold water, this is where Tide Coldwater has saved me so much money and I just love the smell!!! Thank you soooo much for making this product. Please don't take it off the shelf, I already have a hard time finding the bottles that wash more than 26 loads in the stores!
Our clothes come out clean and smelling great consistently! We are also very excited about the energy savings of not having to use the hot water.
I started buying the coldwater fresh scent when they started selling it. I have 2 daughters both teens at the time and they loved the smell of their clothes. They noticed right away. I've always used Tide, it was what I was raised on but I do love the way it smells. Works great.
im srending this regarding your product i purshed recently the liquid detergent was very watery and did not bring my clothes clean i love your product and will continue using but thought you should know thank you from a concerned customer
Ever since I was a little girl Tide has been the only laundry detergent I have been able to use. Everything else makes me break in a rash. And I have tried them all.
My son is horribly allergic to the Mountain Fresh scent. It would be nice to see what is in it so that we can figure out what he's allergic to. I like the concept of Coldwater Tide. Why can't you come up with a scent free version, like regular Tide?
The odor is strong and lingers. I had to rewash all items because it bothered me to the point I could not sleep in those sheets. THE WHOLE BOTTLE WAS A COMPLETE LOST.
I HAVE USED TIDE ALL OF MY LIFE MY MOTHER, GRANDMOTHER USED TIDE . I ALWAYS WASH ALL MY CLOTHES IN COLD WATER, TIDE COLDWATER LOVE IT ! .
I used to always buy the store brand because it was cheaper but after all these years I finally after I seen the cold water Tide come out I bought it. Now I will never go back to the other brand. Our clothes are so much better the whites are so much whiter. I also buy the stain release for the washer and the dryer bar. They are also great products. Thanks to you I am saving money and our clothes look so much better.
I USED COLDWATER TIDE AND THEN I COMPARED MY WHITES NEXT TO THE WHITES I WASHED WITH ANOTHER PRODUCT. THERE WAS NO COMPARISON, COLDWATER TIDE WAS MUCH WHITER. RECOMEND TO ALL MY FRIENDS
Tide is a great detergent, but why buy a bunch of water and an unenvironmental frendily plastic bottle. Buy the powder! It works tons better and the box is recyclable fiberboard!
I am an avid Tide only user, and all Tides work in cold water but this is the best! I use a small amount of pretreat on my kids' stuff that they destroyed and almost always get the stains, which is really saying something! Love it, love it love it!!!!!!!!!
I absolutely love this product! I used it up until recently. I began breaking out and had to switch. But, I still recommend it to anyone that doesn't have a perfume allergy.
I have been a Tide user for 30 some years, would never use anything else. All of the Tides work well in cold water. I haven't used anything but cold water to wash for years. Best product on the market today. I switch scents every so often for variety, they all smell great. Keep up the good work!!!!!
EXCELLENT 4STARS I HAVE A HUGE FAMILY AND WE LIVE ON A DAIRY FARM,,, FROM STAINS TO GREASE COLD WATER TIDE GETS IT ALL OUT AND LEAVES ARE CLOTHES SMELLING CLEAN AND CRISP.. WILL NEVER USE ANOTHER PRODUCT,, GOOD JOB TIDE TEAM~~~~~ CUSTOMER FOR LIFE.....
Love your cold water product but I am waiting for an HE VERSION as I have recently purchased a front loader. Please hurry
It would help if the product finder allowed a person to search by scent. I can't stand the "fresh scent" but don't mind "mountain spring" and now we can't seem to find it anywhere in our area. Actually, if you made an unscented Coldwater, we'd be happiest.
I bought a huge bottle of this, seeing the CR rated it with top marks and thinking it would save me money with the cold water. Well, I had just started an executive job and bought all new clothes. They quickly began to show wear in ways I'd never seen. The edges of my pants started to fade, shirts faded, pima cotton shirts developed pin holes that spread. I'm convinced that this product cleans well in cold because it has harsher cleaners and is no value because it wears your clothes out faster. While I stand by the Tide brand, I do not recommend coldwater.
I've been using Tide Coldwater for a couple of years, but the new liquid takes stain removal up a notch. I have great luck washing even white socks in cold water. Now, when do we get an HE version? I have both a top-loading and front-loading washer, and would love to use Tide Coldwater liquid in my front-loader.
I love this product and it works fabulously; however, I can't use anything but the original scent Tide due to the scent only. Please help Tide and keep up the good work.
I USE TO BE VERY ALLERGIC TO TIDE. AS A CHILD, I WOULD BREAK OUT BAD. BUT, NOW, IT IS WORKING SO FAR. I AM BEGINNING TO LIKE IT. THANK YOU.
I Don't see the difference with the color caps except that it is easy to find the scent I like by the cap color. Save the cap from the larger one if you like it so much. I prefer the cap colored.
I would recommend this product but would appreciate it if there were a dye/fragrance free version as we have several family members with skin allergies, which means separating into several loads. Please make a dye/fragrance free version!!!
Washes great. Whites are really white. Blue cap not good. measuring cap should be white or clear like the really big size. keep it up Tide.
I still find it difficult to use cold water to clean our towels. I wonder if anyone else shares the concern of not getting them clean in cold water?
I love this product, and it works just as well in hot water.
It cleans my clothes great. The best thing I like about this product is that it cleans my whites like the regular tide did. The one thing I don't like about the product is that it hard to find in San Diego, so whenever I see it I buy it.
I have been a lifetime user of Tide but I was also looking for something to help conserve with our electric bill for the hot water. When I saw this in the store I was so excited about Tide coming out with detergent for cold water. Did it live up to it's reputation? YES, it sis. I am very pleased and will continue using Coldwater Tide.. My hats of to you.
I have not tried this product yet, but from the sounds of it I will be making a wise decision. Love Tide and now helps me save money and go green!!
Great product!....but my son has allergies, so I can't use it for everything. It'd be perfect if it came in a fragrance/dye free option :)
I USUALLY USE STORE BRANDS TO SAVE MONEY BUT NOT ON MY WASHING SOAP. MY CLOTHES COME OUT SPARKLING CLEAN WITH TIDE WITHOUT FADING THE COLORS
Great product but horrible smell(s) either of the two that are available are bad. Let's hear it for an unscented version of this super cold water detergent.
tide coldwater is amazing, it took out 1 month old mustards stains that were even set in by the dryer. it saves you money on heating water too, it practically sells itself.
I always use cold water Tide - when I can find it. It is the only detergent that I like. Both scents are awesome. Love it - wish it were everywhere!
I love Tide Coldwater but sometimes the scents affect my allergies. It would be WONDERFUL if Tide Coldwater came in unscented like the regular Tide.
Only detergent I buy. Love the clean smell and the way they look. Gets out stains. Perfect for cold water.
I have used the cold water tide several times now and all my clothes have a musty odor when theycome out of the dryer and especially when I iron a shirt or blouse. It seems to make the smell stronger. I do not like the product at all. I have used Tide for years, both the liquid and the granules. I am so disappointed and would like to return the bottle to the store I bought it from for a full refund.
I decided to give Tide Coldwater a try since I'm a college student trying to save money on everything I possibly can. I wanted to save on my energy bills, so I switched to Tide Coldwater detergent. It gets stains out so well in COLD water! Who would've thought?! I kill two birds with one stone using this product---getting my clothes clean/stains removed + saving $$$ on energy bills! The only thing I can think of is that there should be more locations that carry Tide Coldwater...I had to look at so many stores to find Tide Coldwater. Thanks Tide Coldwater!
Very economical. Sometimes have difficulty finding it on the shelves. Think most don't realize the benefits of this Coldwater laundry soap. Love it.
I love this detergent! Not only does it save $ in heating water, but it seems to get my clothes cleaner than the hot water variety. Certainly helps keep colors from fading. Best yet, I can do laundry without taking hot water away from family members who want to shower.
I used this at home with great results both for colored clothes and whites. Since I know that my son does not sort his laundry, I sent him off to school with a big container of Tide Coldwater. He too was happy with the results. The bonus is that we saved on the gas bill because we were using less hot water.
Being a typical guy I've got "favorite" shirts. Luckily for me we started using COLDWATER TIDE, and even the ones that are getting old in years still look good enough to be on the hanger in a store... it's amazing! And as a bonus, not only is everything that goes through our washer still looking new, but we're saving major money each month on our energy bill. After the first few weeks of using COLDWATER TIDE we reset the hot water heater to the lowest setting, which is ample for showers, hand washing, and the dishwasher. Just this week, our comforter's cover got red Gatorade spilled on it. We blotted it off, then presoaked with COLDWATER TIDE, and washed it. NO STAIN: not even a trace remained... AWESOME!!! Thanks, TIDE!!!
I have been washing in cold water for about a year now. I love this product. It is however a little hard to find because of the little town that I live in. Thank Denise
This detergent is simply the best..a great fresh scent and even suds up in the hardest of water.
It would be even better if it was available UNSCENTED. Many people have allergies to the scented offerings and would appreciate having an unscented Tide cold water option. Thanks.
I have switched to this product as an effort to go green with our family laundry. It does a great job at getting things clean but the lack of a translucent cap makes measuring difficult. It's hard to be green and save some green when you use too much or too little. Please clear up the cap P&G.
I wash everything in cold water but my whites. I love Coldwater Tide. My problem is it is very hard to find. I found Powder Coldwater Tide once and loved it but never have found it again. Why not make that so I can buy it in the warehouse stores? I have 2 teens which makes for a lot of laundry. Detergent is not cheap and when you can only get a certain size bottle, it doesn't last long. Bigger containers and powder would be great.
I tool love the Tide coldwater, but I can't find it!! Especially in the powder which I prefer. The few times I have found it, it works awesome. I have 3 boys so that says alot.
cold water tide is the best. saves me $ by washing in cold water. still gets my families clothes nice and clean. when it first came out, i found it all the time in the stores. now i hardly ever see it..my lost.......................
I use this on all of my laundry and have found that I can actually use about a quarter to half of what is recommended on the bottle and still get a really good clean. Does not bother my allergies or cause me to break out in hives.
The Tide Coldwater really works well and gets your clothing clean without the residue.
I like the idea of washing in cold water but they don't have an alternative for HE washing machines. I have used Tide Coldwater in my washer, but I understand that it could get ruined by using regular detergent. I wish Tide would make an HE cold water alternative. In FAQ they say to use the HE detergents, but they don't explain why not to use it in HE machines and what the cold water alternative is.
I really love this product for washing my 4 grown boys filthy work clothes but have a hard time finding it! I hate the Mountain Sring scent, which makes it even more difficult to find. Now that I went out and bought a front loader to conserve energy, I find you do not make cold water Tide in HE at all!
This detergent is a great value. Don't be fooled by the small bottle. Stick to the correct / recommended measurements and it will last a long time. All with a name we've learned to trust.
Another commentor mentioned that his shirts developed pin holes that got bigger. I have the same problem, but it is all things that I wash and isn't limited to pinholes: all my collars, seams rotted. I am throwing away T-shirts by the handful. I know, quit using it... the problem was that by the time you notice that your washing is disintegrating before your eyes it is too late. Any thing that has a weakened area is going to fall apart (including any part that is sewn through). This stuff is way too strong. After I discovered this I thought that it must be great for heavy soils. Nope, just kept rotting the fabric. Did find it lifted the caked on soap that was stuck in the bottom of my machine (behind the basket). You know the "rock" that harbors mildew? It is gone, in chunks. I can not recommend this to anyone other than an enemy... oh yes and it stinks. I even tried using a 1/4 measure, same results. Bad, bad, bad...
Works awesome and washing in cold cut my power bill in half, in most every household, 3/4 of power goes to hot water, try it, it's totally worth it, also works better than any detergent, I've used even in warm water
I love this really cleans clothes and they smell great
I decided to try Tide after using an off brand for about a year. The other detergent I was using I had to buy at least once a month if not more often because I was using so much just to get my clothes clean. I tried Tide and I love it! I don't have to use as much toget my clothes clean, they smell great, and I don't have to buy detergent every month! Great Clothes and Savings, I love it!
Smells good. Cleans good and a reasonable price. What more could you ask for.

After receiving this product have been using it ever since, it's that good. I use only three cups for my laundry with the crystals and it last still my next wash. This is a fabulous item and will continue to use because it leaves no film, greasy spots only a fresh smell. Tide is the best with outer and under garments stain and odor removals. A True gem!
Excellent product. Always consistent, no harsh chemicals.
Product gives my cat energy and he likes to eat it, he does not like every type of cat food. I love that this cat food is recommended by veterinarians. Price is not too bad for the size and quality as well.
I am so relieved that you offer shipping on this. The store is not stocked on a regular basis and I have difficulty getting to the store and lifting the larger bags. Iams is the only cat food I use and if you didn't carry this I would go to another grocery/pet store.
My cat is an overweight cat, had hairballs all the time and had a lot of pet dander. I've used other brands, never saw any results so decided to try Iams indoor weight & hairball care. She has been eating it for about a month now. I have noticed that she hasn't had any hairballs and that her coat looks beautiful. No more pet dander! I'd highly recommend this cat food!
i LOVE THIS PRODUCT AND ABOVE ALL MY CATS (3)AND ALSO THE FAST SHIPPINGtHANK YOU
My cats were on a different brand for years and started throwing it up. We tried four different brands including the holistic and natural $$$ brands. This was the only food that they did not get sick on plus they are eating less and have more energy. I have noticed less srcatching/grooming and less litterbox odor. Thank you iams!
I usually purchase the Adult Hairball Control, but this time I am thought I would try the indoor cat/ hairball control formula and have been cleaning up hairballs ever since. Never going to buy this product again. Into the garbage it goes!!
I have two cats Faye who has a weight problem she was spade and got fat and Sully who has a hairball problem I was buying two different food and mixing them together and I wasn't noticing a change in either cat i found the Indoor weight and hairball control for them and Sully's hairball went away and Faye lost weight On the off chance that my BF buys a different food sully gets hairballs again He's not allowed to buy any other food
My cat had been vomiting up all the catfoods that I had tried. He was coughing up hairballs atleast once a day. After trying this catfood for anly a week there was a significant different in Jinx. He was more active, had no hairballs and no more vomiting after he would eat. It is a little costly compared to other brands, but the health and happiness of my cat is important to me. I have recommended this cat food to friends. Also as another reviewer put, I have seen a decrease in the smell of his litter box. It's truely amazing! I will never feed my cat anything else again. ( Unless the vet tells me too!)
I've fed my cats the indoor/hairball formula for nearly all of their lives. They've thrived on Iams so I'll not need to change what they get. I love these animals so much and their reaction to me is the same. Thanks for producing a fine product.
I have been feeding my cat another Iams dry cat food and I am trying to introduce him to the Indoor Weight & Hairball formula (by mixing the 2 types) since he is not as active in the winter. He will not even touch the Indoor Weight & Hairball formula - the taste must be much different. I am not fond of the size of the food because it is smaller and not as much chewing is involved to keep his teeth clean.
Iams ProActive Health Indoor Weight And Hairball is the best cat food
Our cat has long hair and has hairballs all year long. I was using a well known brand that I thought was good for her and its not too expensive. Well since she was throwing up alot of it and then eating again it ended up not being such a great deal and I had enough cleaning up hairballs (and whatever else came up). I decided to try the IAMS hairball remedy and not only did she love it, but she has not had one hairball since then. Its great. Its worth the little extra and she doesn't eat near as much as she used to.
I find that all of my cats are eating better portions and not vomiting!
I have 6 cats, and was cleaning up multiple regurgitated hairballs daily! I was really getting sick of it too, not to mension how gross it is. Started using the Iams weight & hairball contol, and cannot even begin to tell you the huge difference it has made in our lives! I am no longer cleaning up hairballs on a daily basis. Very rarely if ever do I have to clean one up now. It makes a difference in the litter box waste too. I find that the smell is not quite as bad, and the cats never get the runs, like they did with other brands. I will admit, it is quite costly to feed this to a 6 cat household, but in the long run it is worth it, and they love the food! I can use all the coupons I can get!! Thanks!!
A steal of a Deal puchased through Wal-mart
I have three indoor cats and buy cat litter frequently. I've tried all kinds of litter in the past, some of the really cheap stuff made my house smell like an animal shelter. This litter is great for a small space with a decent price and easy to scoop. All of my litter boxes are in a small basement bathroom. I've had many people tell me they don't smell any cat smell in my basement at all, however I do scoop the litter everyday. My cats must like it too because I've they've never had an accident in the house.
Sometimes cats vomit for no good reason.. 'at least that we know of' but when they are on Iams they hardly ever vomit or get hairballs...I have 3 cats, one 7 one 6 and one under a year...The older ones are picky but they like this cat food brand, kitten will eat anything, and I mean anything!!
I originally chose this specific type of Iams because it had whole chicken as the first ingredient. I tried this with my boys and they absolutely loved it. As soon as I put the food in their bowls, it's gone shortly after. They beg and beg for more, by the time morning comes, they are meowing for some! I have noticed that this product helped my youngest cat gain some weight. He's really starting to fill out and looks great. The only "negative", if that's what you want to call it is it has made their breaths smell. But I can't complain that much! They love their food!
Other than being a good diet for my cats and a great product there seems to be less in the bag every time I buy the cat food. The price stays about the same but it has gone from 20# to 14# in the bags in not so many years. :-(
This is a quality food for cats. It provides good nutrition and helps maintain a shiny, healthy coat.
good buy,,but haven't received coupon for rebate for bonus 4 lb bag.
I had been using the hair ball formula, but decided to try the Digestive Care formula.I am very pleased with it as I have an older cat and he is digesting his dry food better.
As my cat has pancreatitus, I have to have a special food for him. Aside from buying directly from the vet...which cost a small fortune, especially when you have 3 cats and cannot separate their food, this is the best kind for his stomache, intestines, and pancreas. It is gentle enough for his stomach and the price is great. This size bag will feed 3 adult cats, 2 of them are overgrown, for over 2 weeks. May not last long for some people but in our house, thats excellent.
I had been feeding the Proactive Health formula exclusively. Then, found it not available. Now available occasionally. Get the system full so I can buy it. It's wonderful for my four cats.
I have been feeding Iams since the late 80s. I used to show Persians and there was simply no other option but Iams in my opinion. One of my persians lived to be 18 and my youngest is now 14. I can't imagine that type of longevity with any other type of cat food. Thank you Iams for making such a great product!
The kibble size is not to small and not to large. Food smells fresh when the bag is opened. I like that I can get this food at a variety of stores, including those opened 24 hours a day. My cats give this food 20 paws up :-) And my wallet says "thank you Iams!" I found a really good food that is no longer breaking my piggy bank and agrees with ALL of my cats.
My cat has a Digestion problem. and some other issue's with her health. When I first got her I tried different types of cat food but nothing seem to work like Iams ProActive health digestive care cat food! I was really impressed!
this is a little spendy but it doesnt take much to fill my cats tummy with this.
I'm really happy with this product. My cat enjoys it, and is much healthier eating it. And their instructions on the package make it easy to control her weight by the daily serving amounts listed.
That's right.... order it online and they will deliver it right to your door!!! Amazing and this is the only cat food that helps my older cats sensitive digestive system.
Only use Iams for my cats!!!
I have been feeding my cats (and dogs) Iams throughout the years. I have owned cats for 26 years. Of my feline friends that have not had genetic disorders that caused early end, the longest lived were Symon 19 and Cleo 19. I attribute their health, as well as their long lives not to just loving care, but to the excellent quality of Iams cat food. I would give my cats or dogs nothing less!
I'm sure other cats love this food but my cats won't eat it and I'm really surprised. I know this is a good food with all the things to keep cats healthy but my 2 cats just aren't interested.
My cat really enjoys this dry food. Even though it isn't as cheap as some other brands, it has done a good job keeping her weight under control. Although the "hairball care" aspect of this food was secondary to me, she hasn't had a hairball in ages! It really works, even when I figured the difference would be marginal.
my cats love this food. it was fresh when it came here.
Ordered online, got my coupon for 5 off any size any iams, my cat loves it so much i would deff. recommend to a friend. It shipped for a cheap price to my home, and was so quick to get here.
I love buying the Iams cat food and the 35lb Tidy cat Scoop litter online from Walmart. I always get at least $45 worth so it is delivered free to my door. A lot easier for me to handle.
My cat, a four month old female won't touch this food (even if I "hide" it in wet, canned food)! At breakfast, when she is the hungriest, if she smells it, she won't eat it, and walks away. I wasted my money, I had to throw it away.
First time using this brand. Kitten likes it and it doesn't give him smelly poops, like some brands do :-)
We adopted two 9 month old kittens, Adam & Arthur, about 2 weeks ago. We have had cats before but not this young. I asked the shelter, O.A.R, what they were feeding them. They told me no less than Iams. I'm not sure if it was the kitten formula and I wasn't sure if they would like it. They have been eating it everyday since! They really like it! Nice shiny coat and enough energy to drive you crazy! :) Thanks Iams!
we adopted miss alice from a family friend and they were feeding her iams kitten food. and they said that its a good food to give her. so she has always has a shiny coat and we will keep give her iams throughout life
Initially I purchased Iams kitten food on the spur of the monent when I found out my daughter was going to adopt two kittens. It was the first bag I saw on the shelf and I needed to get everything for their arrival. The kittnes arrived and really seemed to enjoy the Iams food so I continued purchasing it. It did not take long to see how healthy looking their coat's were and how active they were. My daughter has moved out and I have always had cats since I could remember. I adopted two litter mates, male and female. Bill and Rose were started on Iams Kitten Food from the start and they are fine examples of the cat family. Their coats are sleek and shiny, they are balls of energy. Since they are approaching adulthood I am looking at the different varieties of Iams adult cat food to see what would be best for them.
We have a beloved pet ferret named boots and it is important to me for her to be on the right diet! Ferret food is very expensive but with this particullar brand of kitten chow she gets all of the nutrient she needs and she looks and act healthy :) It is exceptional food for the price and wonderfuly crafted!
i have owned 6 cats in my life, and they were all adopted as kittens. I fed every cat this food, and they all loved it! When i adopted my first cat Speedy, i didn't really know alot, and this was the first food i tried. He loved it, and so did every cat after that. I just got my first kitten in a few years today, and i picked some of this up because i knew it was the best for my pets. Great food!
I am 12 weeks old and my mommy started me on Iams Kitten Food because my big brother Thomas has always been an Iams Cat. He is very big and healthy and has a beautiful coat and I know my mommy wants that for me also. I want to be just like my big brother and be healthy and look beautiful. I have been to the vets twice and in three weeks time I have put on 1# and the vet says I look very healthy and very cute. In fact I am just "too cute". I still don't like to eat dry food as I was given wet food to begin with by my previous owners, but mommy put me on Iams immediately as she feels it is the most healthful and nutritious and will give me everything I need to get a good start on adult life. For now she puts some water on the dry food to get it soft as that is the way I like it best. My mommy says I am a "live wire" as I am so playful and am always running around the house and jumping and also doing all kinds of sommersault manuevers. My mommy even recommmended to her friend to give her two cats Iams. She has been an Iams lover for many years.
The kittens love the taste, but I wish it didn't have corn meal as a second ingredient.
I have 6 cat children. 2 of them are under 6 months. They love the Iams Kitten formula! (They have been getting Iams Kitten since they could eat kibble) The triangle shaped kibbles are easier for their tiny mouths to manipulate into smaller bites. Both babies are growing rapidly and are very active and healthy!
I aquired a Russian Blue Kitten from a local rescue. The rescue owner was feeding a good brand of kitten food but Ziva was still not looking good. She had a dull coat, low energy, and would eat almost 4 cups of food a day. I desided to switch to a differant brand and a friend had a bunch of kitten food after she found it a new home. I slowly added it to Zivas' food and at first she was eating less so I thought she didn't like it but she started to put on weight and her coat got slick and shiney. Thank you for making a high quality food for my kitten that even a college kid can afford.
Great for cats that are indoors it helps keep them healthy especially if you do not beleive in shots...
Finally a food my cats do not barf up and if they do, it does not stain things as much as other products!
WE RESCUED OUR CAT...SHE IS A HEFTY 13 POUNDS, BUT MOST OF IT IS LOOSE SKIN...STILL, SHE IS CURVY. I THOUGHT I WAS DOING THE BEST THING FOR HER WHEN I PICKED UP A STORE BRAND "INDOOR CAT" FOOD-FIGURING SHE WOULD GET EVERYTHING SHE NEEDED. WELL, THE VET SAID THAT THE BEST THING FOR HER WAS THE HAIRBALL CARE. IT HAS LESS CARBS AND WILL HELP HER NOT TO GAIN WEIGHT AND STAY HEALTHY. IT HAS ALSO OBVIOUSLY BEEN GOOD TO TAKE CARE OF HAIRBALLS. IT'S NICE TO KNOW I'M DOING THE RIGHT THING FOR HER ON MULTIPLE LEVELS. AND OF THE "BETTER" BRANDS, IAMS IS SO AFFORDABLE ALSO.
I have 2 cats, My oldest is 10 years, She been on this product forever, When I run out, she lets me know. I recommend this to all cat lovers.
my persians have a great coat, firm stools, love the taste, and have reduced the number of times they throw up hairballs. I would recommend this product to everyone with cats.
For years I've been having to give my oldest cat hairball remedy which she hated. It was stressful for both of us and frustrating for me because I didn't know how much was right for her or how often I should give it. This food takes the stress out of it and the guess work as well. Both my 10 month old kitten and her love the taste and their stools are a lot firmer.
Ive got two indoor cats, one I'm trying to get to lose weight and the other old boy who needs to put some on.This food is great for the both of them , in only two weeks I'm seeing results.
I have had every cat and kitten eat this food. I recently got a kitten that wouldn't eat any of the foods I bought, even the most expensive. I tried this and he ate it all! My mothers cat is the same this is the only food she will eat. I don't know what tastes so good here, but if your cat won't eat it I would love to know.
I have always had a multi cat household. The one problem has been to find a food that would meet the needs of my cats with different weights. As soon as Iams came out with their multi cat food I tried it. The results were amazing, my thin cats put on muscle mass and my heavier cats lost weight. Also I have not had any problem with hairballs with my long haired cats. I have been using this food for several years and my vet says my cats have never looked better or been healthier. I will not serve anything else to them. I expect my cats will live long and healthy lives as long as they are feed Iams products. I highly recommend this product.
My cat was on another brand of cat food for 6 months... he continued to look worse, his coat was not healthy looking, etc.... put him back on IAM's and he is looking GOOD!
My cats, tidy and toto, love the taste of this iams formula. They are domestic shorthairs and come running when they here me opening the bag of food. Their coat and overall health seems to have improved since i,ve been feeding them the iams for the last three months.
My cat was having issues with her joints, stiffness, etc. My vet recommended IAMS Senior. She gets around much better and even feels ok when there is a storm on the way. Old wives/cats tale I know but my husband's knee aches at the same time too so they are good buddies together. My only con for this is that it does not have anything for hairballs.
I bought this dog food and did not read the ingredients first. I will return and choose another Iams product. I don't want to feed my dog food that is mostly corn meal. I want something that is mostly meat, fruit and some veggies. This dog food has listed corn meal as the first ingredient, so I know that is what it is mainly made of. I know you have products with meat listed first, and I will select one of those even if they are not for over weight dogs.I not unhappy with Iams, but wish I had taken time to read the ingredients.
My large mix breed, Lola has been losing at least two pounds per month. Not too much or too little for her health and exercise level. Her vet is very happy.
I have been breeding ragdoll cats since 1998..I am very particular what goes into my cats since they are my family members and mean alot to me ..Raising kittens I have notoced a marked difference in the health and vigourous energy in my newborns and i am becoming convinced this food is the best thing I have fed.The coats on my ragdolls is remarkable and they have a bright healthy look with clear eyes and quick little minds....I am buying this food consistently and I want to thank the iams company for this product!! Great job Thank you!!!
I switched my "mature" cat from Iams Dry Food to Iams canned Kitten food on the advice of my vet. Within a week of switching her, I noticed she had more energy, her coat looked better and her sense of playfulness increased (and she's 11 years old!)My only wish about this is that the instructions etc. were printed in white instead of black on the purple.
I would like to have chunky beef as well as chunky chicken in sauce, but my local store and online doesn't seem to have them.
I was buying Special Kitty and then when I needed more cat food the store was sold out. I was able to drive to get more but then waited another 3 weeks and still the closest store to me was still sold out. So I bought a bag of this to mix with the last bag I had and my cats would not eat the other brand. They actually picked this out of the bowl and left the other (and my cats are NOT picky eaters). Its only a quarter more and I have noticed a change in their coats and they come running at feeding time now :) Im glad I changed. Also I love the coupons that usually come in the bag. Saves me that much more $ unlike store brands who don't have coupons.
I was buying Special Kitty for my two cats, until I realized one day at my Walmart, that this was only a quarter more. My cats eat it up!
my kitty loved it...his prior fav was meow mix but i bought this cuz it was on sale and he went nuts for it...there will b no switching back :)
My cats like this and it doesn't upset their stomachs, like some other brands do. The price was amazing and shipping was reasonable and QUICK. I hope Walmart has this food forever.
It's has only 28% protein and corn as the first ingredient. I rather buy Purina Cat Chow for the same price which is 34% protein and the first ingredient is chicken by product, which is much better for cats than corn. I now buy Purina Cat Chow Naturals which has 38% protein for a healthier cat. It's is the best value compared to other discount dry cat foods.
great item cat loved it would recomend to anyone cheap and cheerfull always a winner.
as soon as i came in the door my cat was all over the bag
When I made this purchase, I paid only 10 dollars for a 16 LBS bag. I have to say my cats really like this food. They are eating this stuff like there is no tomarrow. I like to feed my pets the best possible food I can afford. Friskies does a good job with thier seafood flavors.
I have used Friskies for almost eight years. I now use Surf and Turf as a dry food exclusively. It is balanced for all my cats, and so far none have any problems with digesting it. I try to buy 10-12 bags at a time, as supply sometimes is behind. I recommend this product to anyone with one or more cats. When you find something that works, stick with it. I also use the Friskies canned food as a supplement or for special occasions.
This is such a great way to shop when the weather is bad. You can purchase your pets food for the same price as you would in the store and ususally for 99cent shipping or free shipping. I love it. I bought 2 large bags of cat and dog food and sealed the extra ones in a tote and keep them in my garage.
i LOVE this cat food! not only is it affordable its FREE SHIPPING to home which is wonderful with someone like meh who is too sick to drive to the store! thankies so much WALMART.com for having this so affordable and easy to get! not to mention meh kitties go nuts whenever they hear the postman knock on the door as they know food will be served!
i have a cat with a very sensitive stomach all other foods give him runs or gas but noticed no problems with this one. he has actually gained a few pounds. great product
this is the best price with the best quantity- and ive done my research! thanks, walmart. i will be purchasing my kitten's products from here from here on out.
My cats love the taste and what a great price for how much is in the bag !
My cats and dog love it!!!My dog will not eat dry dog food.
my cats love this
My cat's love this food! Walmart offers the best price for this product. I searched online and could not find a better price. The fact that it is so low priced and shipping is so inexpensive makes purchasing online cheaper than actually driving to the store to get it! Thanks,Walmart!!
What can I say? If my cats are happy then so am I.
fantastic !!! never had any issues. the delivery is fast...
We have 5 rescued young cats in 2 houses. They've loved this at first but after 3 wks they started to get disinterested and eat only half of their servings. I decided to buy other Friskies Dry Signature Blend for change of taste. Planning to order these Surf & Turf and the Signature Blend every month.
my cat's seem to like friskies the best and the cost is slighty lower then other's,friskies also give's out coupon's quite often
My cats favorite food. Fast delivery.
This taste seem to make most of my out door spay&neuter cats happy. They get all they want during the day between the two wet feedings. I rely on a product that will keep them well from below freezing weather to the cat days of summer, and it does..At 63 it's hard to load and unload 20 bags of kibble at a time,Friskies surf and Turf 16lb bags were delivered FREE SHIPPING right to my door. It just doesn't get better :)
Our Cats just Love their Friskies Surf and Turf.We give 1/3 cup of the dry cat food to eachCat.They Lick their bowls Clean. Alternating with other Walmart Cat Foods,they receive theirFriskies Surf and Turf every 3rd day throughout the month.
I would reccommend this for anyone with cas
I have an obease kitty (31 lbs) and this food carries a low fat content. Lower than most of the over the counter cat food. If you have fat indoor kitties, I recommend this food!
I wanted to try this on my feral community so they would have a new healthy taste to try. They loved it and I am going to add it to their feeding program. So they taught me even outdoor cats love that indoor feeling :-)
My cat Loves Friskies Indoor Delights and I Love the fact that Wal-Mart.com gives me the option of ordering online and having it shipped to my home. So it's a Win Win situation. Great value for the money.
Thanks to switching to this food my house smells good again! After trying multiple brands & formulas this is the first catfood that doesn't make my cat stink us out of the house!!!
both kitties seem to like it. good thing.
My cats love this food. Although it seems as though they have to eat more to be fully satisfied. I have bought this food for several years since my cats will actually eat it.
This food has been fed to outdoor cats, For several years.This is the prefered flavor or dry food. These cats appear healthy and have excellent coats. Very active. One cat is over fifteen years old, and in excellent health.I also noted that various local Scrub Jays, Racoons and one Opposum, enjoy this flavor also. (I'm not getting close enough to inspect their coats and feathers!)My only reccomend change would be to add a carrying handle to the sixteen pound bag.The cat's like it and eat well.
My cats eat Friskies & love it.
my cats love this product!
My husband and I are "cat people" and have been for over 20 years. We've always had cats in our home, and are always helping to socialize stray kitties, care for strays until they can be adopted out, donate money towards spay/neuter programs. we will even go out of our way to visit places where there are alot of known strays such as the florida keys and new orleans to help feed and care for lost or abandoned cats, and also catch them for the neuter/spay and release programs. my point is, we have more experience than the average person when it comes to feeding felines. one thing we can always count on with FRISKIES brand DRY CAT FOOD (any flavor) is that EVERY CAT WILL EAT THIS FOOD!! We cant afford to waste money on cat food that the felines wont continue to eat- and there are so many brands out there where that is the case and ultimately the food is wasted. Friskies is not priced above its market and continues to prove itself a bargain compared to the other top brands. WE'VE NEVER MET A CAT WHO DOESN'T LOVE FRISKIES BRAND DRY CAT FOOD!!
THIS IS ONE OF THE TWO FLAVORS OUR CATS WILL EAT. GREAT THAT IT SHIPS FREE TO HOME. LIVE IN A RURAL AREA 2 HOURS AWAY FROM STORE.
Friskies seafood sensations gives my cats a nice change every few days. These are out door cats who depend on enough nutrition to stay alive. They thrive on Friskies many flavors and I don't pay outrageous prices for a kibble they just smell and walk away from. Walmart DELIVERED FREE right to my door. It just doesn't get better :)
I enjoyed having this delivered to my door for the same cost as going to the store, loading into cart, going thru checkout line, loading into car, unloading and carrying into the house !!!!
I had been using ProPlan Sensitive Stomach and Skin and it solved the problems they had with vomiting and dandruff. Well, I was furloughed and one time the store had run out of ProPlan, so I decided I would switch them to a brand I could easily pick up on my weekly wal mart trip. So this brand, the Seafood Medley is the only one they will eat besides Fancy Feast, which is about the same price as the ProPlan. However, I am very concerned because the cats are getting so thin and raggedy looking. They rarely eat, and won't touch anything but dry food. I feel so guilty that I am going back to ProPlan.
I have 5 cats from less than a year to 12 years old. All of them love this food. We had them on science diet and they didn't enjoy it nearly as much. This food is also less expensive. Now anytime i walk by their food they come running. Even if its ten minutes since they last ate. All of my cats had other cat food before this food and now i don't think they would eat anything other than it. We adopted a 11 year old cat and after feeding her seafood sensations she would dump her old food all over the floor when we tried to feed it to her. Would recommend this food to anyone who loves their cats!
My cats used to eat Meow Mix and we went to the store one day and they were out. Friskies was a dollar or so more expensive but rather than go someplace else we got the seafood flavor and brought it home. I put the bag on the living room floor and five minutes later both cats were lying on the bag! they love it and we haven't switched back since.
THIS IS THE BRAND I GO TO THE MOST,MY CAT'S REALLY LIKE'S THE FOOD,GREAT PRICE.
Bought some of this because my cats like fish/tuna and I was strapped for cash for the week... big waste of money. They ate it well enough, but over 2 days haven't been able to keep the food down, they have thrown it up every time they have tried to eat it shortly after. Gave them some wet food and tried it again the next day and they both went back to barfing it up. Ingredients are mostly corn meal and junk like that... I'll stick to my regular brand from now on.
However, I lowered my rating because they raised the prices on the 6lb bag. I am going to begin buying the 16lb bags. As for the brand - I love it! I've had my cats exclusively on friskies dry food and they get almost as excited for it as they do for treats (in fact - sometimes I cheat during treat time and give them this food instead). I don't foresee myself ever switching from this food. The price is right and my cats love it - What more could I ask for?
My cat loves anything with seafood flavoring, and, just gobbles this stuff up. The raccoons love it also, so, it must be good!
My cats love this product. I usually get them the seafood sensation and occasionaly I will get them a bag of the indoor one, which they absolutely love and will eat out of the bowl before they even touch the seafood sensation one. I wish Walmart carried the larger bags, like they do of the other 2 flavors.
My cat is a picky eater and she loves this.
Seemed to have a variety flavor that all 3 of my cats like. My one cat has hairball issues frequently which seemed to be reduced eating this.
My cats do not like this food because it makes them go to bathroom too much, so therefore I don't like it either!
So, I recently adopted my friend's cat (Tony) and since he was a kitten, he was eating Friskies. I took him to the vet because he was scratching a lot (I thought he had fleas) but it turns out, he had dry skin! Who knew a cat could suffer from dry skin? I was told this was a good alternative, because Friskies is just "cheap" and not nutritious. About a month on this new diet, his fur is absolutely soft and fluffy and he's no longer scratching all the time! Thank goodness. I'll admit this brand is a little more expensive, but it's worth the money if my little Tony is happy and healthy!
Unfortunately, I made the ultimate mistake and purchased this based on the name and not by reading the ingredients. The 1st 5 ingredients of healthy/natural cat food are NEVER supposed to be corn, wheat or soy and this food has 2 in the 1st 5.
Hay, the cat loves it.
My cat Putsie LOVES this food. She knows the sound of the bag when I open it to put the food in the storage container and the sound of the metal measuring cup scoops food into her bowl. I have always measured her food and that has saved me money and keeps Putsie's calories to a minimum.
I have two 10 month old kittys I still feed Purina Kitten chow that they love. I have just started to mix this brand with that and they really enjoy it. I like that they are smalll morsal of dry food for the cats to swallow, as you know they don't chew their food. I like the ingrediants put in it. I think for the amount of dry food you get this is of great value when you are on a budget or feeding a lot of cats.
my cat salem just loves it the only food he will eat
Even before our kitten was allowed adult food she'd sneak pieces of Purina Naturals from our adult cats. It's fairly high-calorie, so it's best if you keep an eye on portions or at least an eye on your cat's weight, but this is a cat-favorite for sure. Some people use this as a main food, or even as cat-treats; it's a lunch food in our routine, and lunch is the most loudly requested/demanded meal of the day.
My cats LOVE this food. I tried Blue Buffalo because it is supposed to be more nutritional for them but they won't eat it and the cost was 35.00 per bag! So I will stick to Purina Naturals and keep them happy and the price keeps me happy.
I got this because two of my cats developed food allergies to Purina One and Iams. We tried several brands (costly) that the vet recommended most were a waste because they HATED them, but they all enjoy this one, no one throws it up and the itching, scratching and fur falling out is abating.
My cat loves this food!! And I love what it does for him!!
I feed feral cats and have been buying this food for them for a long time. They have done very well on it. I usually buy from the Athens PA store but have been told that they are not carrying Purina products anymore because of a supply problem. I always bought this in the 16 pound bag which has not been available for over a month. When I asked why the food was not there I was told that Walmart is having a "problem" with Purina. I don't know if that is true but I don't appreciate making a trip to purchase products and then finding they are not available. I would like to know if Walmart is discontinuing Purina cat food products or not.
My tuxedo cat Boo has a horrible time with hair balls and this is the only food that keeps him from getting them!! We have tried every kind of food, from very expensive to just average brands, with no luck, until trying Purina Naturals. Thank you!!!
I worry about vitamins and health when it comes to my cats, one is indoors and one loves to go outside. I know that Envy munches on grass and what he needs outside. I worry that August is not getting what his body needs from dry kibble. I like to read the contents of everything my cats eat and love how balanced and nutritious the Purina Cat Naturals blend is.
I have found that one of my cats is a very picky dry food eater and the Naturals was the only thing I found she ate! My other cat is not so picky so getting him to eat it was no problem. Thank-you for a great product!!
We;ve tried a couple of them, But this is the only one that she loves . We figure why keep trying ?I would like to try her on the healthy weight, she's gotten a "little" chunky
I have a 19 month old Male indoor/outdoor Cat... Buddy. I started him on Purina Kitten and then moved to Purina One. He tired of eating the Purina One and I was worried that he wasn't getting enough nutrition. 4 Months ago I started him on Purina Naturals. He LOVED it from the start. He'd eat the Natural kibbles and not eat the Purina One kibbles when I mixed them to get him used to the new food. It only took a couple of days on the "Naturals" and he cleans his dry food bowl within the day. I had him to the Vet for his check up last week and the Vet said he's "healthy and beautiful"! His coat is beautiful and his energy level is fantastic. He's a perfect weight for his size and is the happiest Boy you could imagine. I LOVE the Purina Naturals and more importantly, Buddy loves it too!
This is the only product my cat can eat. She seems to be allergic to every other cat food. She has a very sensitive stomach and this is the only cat food that her stomach can tolerate. Would love to find another cat food with the same ingredients as this product but a different flavor so my cat would have something different to eat once in a while but have not found anything like this cat food.
Our 18 month old spayed cat has eaten Purina Cat Chow Indoor Cat Food since she was 3 months old. She loves it, and comes running when we call, "want something to eat?" Unfortunately, she has become quite overweight. So our next bag of cat food will be a weight control variety.
My cat, Bugsy, has been living off your product for 18 years. He has such radiant fur, and he doesn't have many furballs. Although, his breath really stinks and his teeth are practically useless. But, he loves your product and so do we. :)
Since my tom Mr.B weighs 26 pounds and is very sedentary, he's 8, I decided to try him, and my girls, on the formula. They all liked it and I kept them on it until I discovered the Healthy Weight formula which they are being switched too, though I may keep feeding them a combination of both formulas.
Purina is the only food I trust enough to give my cats . They love it & I love it knowing they get all the nutrition they need
My cat must have liked it she ate all of it. I will buy more of it because she usually doesn't eat all of her food, and she seemed to enjoy this much better than her kibbles.
My cat has tried a lot of cat food but with Purina Cat Chow she is a Happy Cat.
to my cats like to eat purinaFOR GOOD PRICESFOR GOOD NUTRITION
I've tried my picky overweight cat on various other foods and she turns her nose up at them so I didn't have much hope for this one when I received my sample in the mail two days ago. I tossed a few bits on the floor in front of her when I first opened the bag and she sucked them down. I filled her bowl up and she ate every bite. I gave her the rest of the bag the next day and it was gone in a matter of minutes. I don't know if my other two cats will eat it or not because they never got the chance to try it! I will be purchasing this on my next trip to the store. I can't be sure that it will help her loose weight, but I can vouch for the fact that picky cats will eat it!
I have four cats, 3 of which are a tad bit overweight. They average weight between them is 17lbs. They're big cats and eat quite a bit. They're not fussy, but, boy, they went to town on Healthy Weight. They LOVED it. I got it as a sample first, then bought a bag and have been buying it ever since. I do believe they have dropped a pound or so each since being on it and are never hungry all the time. This cat food is the best I've bought yet. Thanks Purina, for helping my boys.
Our 15 year old is an EXTREMELY finicky eater, but when I presented a handful of the new Purina Cat Chow Healthy Weight formula, he gobbled it up, so I poured a bowl full & he proceeded to chow down & his younger sister & brother both followed his lead! Thank you for making such a delicious cat food that our babies LOVE to eat! Especially one that has the added benefit of weight management because our oldest isn't overweight, but he could benefit from losing a pound or two, it would help alleviate the severity of his arthritic hips & ankles. Our middle cat, our only female is slender & according to their doctor, she's at a perfect weight, but our youngest is a tad bit overweight, solid as a rock, but very active, so this formula will definitely help him too. We love our babies & knowing they have food they love makes us very happy cat parents! Thank you once again!
Since I became an indoor cat about a year ago, Naturals has been the staple of my diet. I feel healthy and content. No need for a change.
my cats love it and it does not sit in their dishes also they dont vomit it settles right they seem to know the bag they all are happy
your product seems to settle with my cats they arent picky and it sits in their dishalso their not vomitting
My two young female cats seem to love this dry food. Walmart has the best price on this extra large bag.!!!!!
the cats really go after this they luv it they wud eat it all the time the bonus was a good buy everywhere else this is 17 dallors its a good buy
My cat have been a long time fan of any product labeled after the Meow Mix products and he is an extremely picky eater. He enjoys the wet can food from Meow Mix, they are all his favorite. It makes me laugh when he tries to save the rest by scratching the floor near it to hide his food from other cats in the house. After he eats the Meow Mix wet canned cat food, it is a none stop session of licking his mouth. He loves the dry food as well, but not as much as Meow mix can food. I believe the taste is from real ingredients from food other than artificial flavors.
I can get my cats to eat Meow Mix only.I have tried others and wasted my money; so I willstay with this brand.
Order online and it can be shipped to your home. This 17 lb bag lasts so long, no need to buy cat food every week..Love it, and so does my cat Taffy..
No issues with the product and when FedEx had a problem with shipping the folks at Walmart.com straightened out the issue within five minutes of my calling them... awesome service!
My cats love most of the Friskies-Purina Products but what I like about this, is the FREE shipping to my home! It makes life alot easier. This is an excellent value!!
If I purchased a bag THIS big of Meow Mix try, I'm certain they'd kill me in my sleep. :)
must be good got all the neighbor cats eating here now
Received item promptly, undamaged and estimated delivery date
This original MEOW MIX has been a long time favorite of my out door cats and we have 20-30 left in our TNR program. Kibble is worthless if my cats won't eat it. I need them to nibble on it all day between their wet food on these sub freezing nights of winter. MEOW MIX is the right stuff because they eat it up in all three feeding spots to my raccoons dismay. At 63 it has become hard for me to load and unload 20-30 bags of food a month but Walmart gives this product FREE SHIPPING right to my door. Life is getting easier around here THANKS :)
This is the only food my cats like. It was great getting it delivered to my house unstead of struggling with it at the store.
My cats love the new flavors of this dry food.
My kitties love this stuff, and Walmart has this big bag for a great price!
Averaged about $2.00 and change for a container of the cat food, whereas , usually is about $8 to $10 dollars for the same wt. containers of food. Makes the Cats and I happy!Thanks Walmart!
It's wonderful to open a box at the door rather than lugging this huge bag of dry cat food around the store, and onto the register for payment, then into the car, then into the house, etc. This is definitely the way I'll be buying cat food from now on!
My cats were fighting over it
grreat product and great price..best of all I had it delivered to my home!!! I do wish the shipping cost was not 45 dollars before it was free, but I love the convenience and the products are great!!!
Great food for my cat's
I have two cats, one has a problem with most cat foods. After trying several on the market, even the most expensive, this cat food was the easiest for them to tolerate without vomitting. I'm glad I finally found this cat food as he was getting skinny from not digesting his foods. They seem to love the flavor, and have been eating this cat food for over a year without a problem. I also feed them Wiskas wet cat food pouches.
Great price, great product & great value. Next time ,I'll double the size of my order!!!
Meow Mix is the only dry food I feed my cats because they love the taste and its easy to digest.My cats refuse to eat any other dry cat food.My kitties think its sublime.I have a kitten thats 6 months old all the way to a 15 year old and the 15 year old is is very energetic from eating this, so it has to be healthy.They wake me up as early as 4:30 in the morning meowing for it.Luv U me and the cats. Also you may think this is funny but even if I put this outside the whole neighborhood of cats drop their plates and come over to my house to eat, some of them ran away from home.
Walmart makes the price on this food good enough for be to feed my 30 or so feral cats, and best of all they bring it packaged perfect to my door and put nice samples in the boxes for us people. The Meow mix is what they want and eat so getting something less pricy just won't work if they don't love it,and what is really cute are the raccoons and wild life it attracts also.Its is a really good product at a good price :)
LOL.... Meow! good!
I have tried out many different cat foods over the last 30 years and Meow Mix has consistently been our cat's favourite. We have many different breeds of rescue cats that stay with us for extended periods of time and this brand consistenly remains the most popular with them. We do try and serve the so-called science diet type dry foods but the cats usually prefer this brand.
ered a few items for our pet. came right away. the bag was huge but priced great!!!! we thank you! :).
But my cat loves it!
My cat loves this stuff!
needs to be fairly priced buying it was something different for them to eat the cats did good but they didnt klike the indoor as much as the origal
My cats love anything fish. They especially love this in dry cat food too. This turns out to be their favorite dry food after trying so many other brands.
I usually get the indoor formula, but decided to give my cats something new. The pieces are definitely bigger than the indoor formula, but the cats love it and it's a pretty good deal!
my 11 cats like it (and all Meow products) and i keep a bowlful everyday
after her first taste it was non-stop eating. Sheba loves it and eats it everyday.
Good
The cats enjoy this food and it really does help control hairballs. Highly recommended.
i have two cats, and they both like it..but it gives one really bad diarrhea and gives her gas. the ingredients are awful too. now i know why she has such bad disgestion problems.
great product/ my cat stopped throwing up right after i started giving it to him.AAAAAAAAA+
I have two cats, but one has a 'sensitive stomach' I say, and the vet agrees. She has very long hair and this food definitely cuts down on hairballs, BUT she also has a problem with finding a pet food that doesn't cause her to upchuck nearly every day. Having tried expensive, non-expensive, all brands, all types, this is the only pet-food she can eat that does not cause her to get a stomach upset every day. My other cats has no problems with anything she eats. It makes it easier to feed them the same food. They both love it and are thriving on it. I
my kitty really likes and its good for hairballs
I tried this because I felt my cats were getting bored with their regular food. One will not touch it and the other loves it. I will buy it again.
This is the only cat food my kitties will eat without throwing it up later. We also appreciate that this food doesn't seem to leave them with stinky breath like some other brands do.
Very good product; my cats love it. I particularly appreciate the packaging.
I feed my cat a multi-flavored dry catfood, canned catfood, and offer Meow Mix Tender Centers Dry Cat Food-Tuna & Whitefish as a treat. She seems to like it.
i have a long haired cat and a short haired cat. this product is wonderful... they don't get hair balls hardly at all.. maybe once every 7 or 8 months. couldn't find it in the store so i'm doing site to store.it is like a treat for my cats. they get a little bowl in the morning and one at nite.. they love it.. haven't been able to find it since we left montana 4 weeks ago... they miss their treat...
a hungry cat will eat anything
My cats are pretty picky. They are not big fans of the original Meow Mix. However, they love this flavor. Will be purchasing more very soon.
The chihuahuas love it because of its size and the 17.5 pound size is big enough to last awhile but not too much to handle and go stale. Love Wal-Marts free delivery.
You can't beat Wal-marts low price anywhere.
I raised my dog, who will be 8 years old on Dec 26th, and she love it. Who am I to argue.
I am very disappointed that the 40lb. bag (which is what I usually buy) has turned into a 33lb. bag for the same price. To save a couple of bucks I ordered two 17.5lb. bags for the sams price as what a 40lb. bag used to go for. I did get a couple of extra pounds doing it this way.
I have a chocolate lab and a cocker spaniel and they both love this food. I think its great as it seems to fill them up faster so they eat less and they also seem to have less waste. I also love it because Walmart delivers it to my door for free, which is great since the nearest Walmart is over an hour away.
Fantastic, I am over 30mls from nearest store that carries my dogs favorite food, so to find out that Walmart will ship Iams for free to my door; and I don't have to lug those big bags from the store to the car, from the car to the house; I am in H E A V E N!!!!! Thank you WALMART! And, the free gifts are a fantastic bonus, too, I have told all of my animal loving friends about this convenience.
My veternarian in PA recommended this dogfood and I use it on all of my dogs. The dogs love this food. I use it for treats when I train them. They act like they are getting something special, which they are. I have healthy happy dogs.
I buy the 17.5 pound Iams Mini-Chunks because my veterinarian recommended the brand and that is the largest size I can find. I usually buy it at the grocery store because of the price, and had not been shopping for it at Wal-Mart stores. When Wal-Mart.com sent me an e-mail promotion that included a cheaper price, a mail-back rebate for a free 8-pound bag of Iams, and free shipping, I went for it. It was delivered several days later by FedEx securely and with a plastic bag to cover it. The dog eats it, so he must approve of the lot to which it belongs. I would always buy dog food this way for the same price and free shipping to avoid lugging it around.
I buy this for my Grandpuppy, Bella, and she loves it!
I have 2 Yorkie mixes and one of them gobbled Iams up..... but he is a vacuum cleaner! My other dog NEVER finishes his bowl! Guess we will stick with Kibbles and Chunks!
Every since our dog began eating IAMS, we have noticed a significant difference in her in a great way! She's very energetic, her coat is full and shiny, strong nails, no smelly breath even! She's healthy and happy! We love it. Even when we are getting the bag out to feed her, she runs to her bowl ready to eat and excited. No other brand has she done this for. Thank u IAMS! We highly recommend it to pet lovers and also we are witnesses to it's nutritional value:-)
if Ranek doesn't eat Iams He has the runs sometime badly we changed his food for a cheaper one and for the week that the other last we were cleaning our carpet nightly because he would wake up in the middle of the night and have to go out but he wouldn't make it to the door and it stank badly so I told my BF you changed his food you clean the mess Needless to say Ranek is an Iams dog again thank god
My dog itched all the time and had bad dandruff. I tied all types of shampoos, conditioner and medical treatments and the poor little thing kept itching UNTIL I tried IAMS. After about a week he quit itching and scratching and his coat looks so shiny! Thanks IAMS, you're a life saver!P.S. My dog loves the taste.
I switched to the Mini Chunks from a cheaper (in terms of quality and price) brand. Shortly after the switch I noticed my dog's dandruff disappeared and their nails became much stronger and stopped cracking. They are very healthy and love their food. Iams food might be more expensive than some other brands but my dogs have needed much less food to maintain their weight so I think the price per serving ends up being very affordable. Its a great product and a great value!
Lefty loves his dog food....especially the small chunks.....and he is a picky eater
I have 2 beagles ages 7 and 9. They love the taste of this food. My 9 years old still races around playing like a young puppy. They are both very active, have nice coats and are at the weight they should be. My vet says their heath is excellent. Thank you to Iams, I hope to have them with me for many years yet!
My dogs have been on Iams for 12 years. I think the quality of food has contributed to their long life span.
I am feeding 4 dogs from age 11 months to 12 years old. They have beautiful coats and gobble their food up daily.
I had a dog that I fed her Iams Mini Chucks for 13 years and she was healthy all her life. Now I have Monty and he is getting the same dog food. I would recommend this dog food to all my friends.
My Pomeranian is 5 years old and has the energy and enthusiasm of when she was a puppy. Her coat is shiny and fluffy. Has never been ill, sleeps well and has bright eyes.
I adopted some rescued mini pins. They were skinny and frail looking. I started them on Proactive mini chunks and have not switched. They enjoy the food and I don't need alot to maintain healthy weight and very shiny coats.
I love that Iams is a reasonable price and it is made with real meat. It's main ingredient isn't corn or by products. I love it and so does my dog. She has a great shiny coat now and she's finally started gaining a little weight. (The vet said she was very mal-nurished when we found her.) I would recommend Iams to anyone with a pet... wait I DO recommend Iams to anyone with a pet! We Just Love It!
my dog loves this food, and i see he has more energy throughout the day.
Cat from Georgia
Thank you for making great products! I must credit Iams food with the long life span of our Golden Retriever, Cayenne, who recently passed at the grand old age of 16! We fed her and still feed our 14 y.o. mixed breed terrier, Frasier, Iams Mini chunks. Frasier is still very active and very healthy at the age of 14.
Excellent pet food. Not only is it high quality food but it is also easy to purchase, doesn't require a special trip to the vets or a pet store. I recommend it to everyone I know that has pets!!
Over the years I have used a number of different brands...I operated a professional kennel and raised champion Miniature Schauzers.The one brand I always came back to was Iams.Currently we have only one pet as we sold our kennek several years agfo to retire. Pippy only will eat your Mini Chunks,,,She actually refuses to eat other brands.
i like the dog food because it is small enough for my dog yet big enough to fill her up.
my dog eats 1 cup of Iams pro active health mini chunks he is very picky over what he east so i am glad he likes this food and its under 30.00
Cheaper than any pet store.It can packaged well. Walmart is great!
This is really good food, and I never have to worry if my puppies are getting the nutrition that they need THEY ARE FOR SURE IAMS DOGS.
when i got this product i looked at it very carefully and realized that there is very little difference from the small chunks, and the toy breed ,there is 1 more chicken type ingredient in the toy breed than the small chunks. but the size of the pieces are the same size in each,i feel that the small chunks is a better value for your money, you can get a 17 bound bag of the small chunk vs the 15.5 pound bag of the toy breed for around the same price.ether choice you make this is the best food out there!!!! my pomeranians coat is so silky and shiny she has a show quality coat and is healthy as a dog can be now thanks to iams dog food.....
I lost my pug in 2007 and used Iams until the day she died. They told me to feed Iams and a pug generally will live to 12/13 yrs. She remained healthy, I believe because of Iams, and lived until just shy of 17 yrs. Two years later, my mixed pup (pomeranian, pekinese, pug "throw away") is now healthily enjoying Iams for the second try! Thank you Iams for a quality pet puppy product.
This is the only food that 9 month Lucy has ever had & she loves it. She is very happy when we pour IAM'S in her dish!
Our dog, Charlie, loves it! He's healthy and has a great coat.
We bought a labrador retreiver puppy about 3 months ago. The breeder told us to feed the pup the brand he uses. All was well for about 2 weeks. Then our puppy started looking sickly have irregular bowel movements and she did not seem to be growing as quickly as my brothers pup. I switched my pup to Iams without introducing it slowly with her old food. She acted like a starving dog. She couldnt get enough and within 2 days she was acting like a playful puppy. Her bowel movements were regular again. She has finished one 17 pound Iams bag and just started on her second bag. Her health is great. She has doubled in size. She is about the same size as my brothers male lab. I am very pleased with IAMS puppy food and will continue her on IAMS for the rest of her life.
This is the best puppy food to buy at the walmart that I shop at. The first ingredient in any dog food a owner should buy is meat. This isn't the best for puppies but if you need to buy cheap food this is the best choice.
Iams is a great product i use it for my shih tzu and he is very healthy and has a very beautiful coat thanks to Iams
I have fed my dogs IAMS products for more than 10 years. Although by no means the least expensive food on the market, it is the best value for the quality of product.
I highly recommend Iams. I had my puppy on Iams and then switched to a lesser expensive brand name, within a couple days on the new food he was shedding more and he was much more hyper. I kept him on the new food for a month or so, then got fed up and switched him back. After a couple days back on Iams his coat is beautiful, he's shedding less, and he's more balanced in his energy. This is a great dog food for the money. One of the few common brands that lists chicken as the first ingredient. I am sold on Iams.
My pup loves the food, he goes crazy for it, just till we get to the bottom of it, its stale... I miss zip lock closing on the bag...it would make it easier for everybody...and my pup more happy
We recently adopted a 6 mos old puppy from the shelter. When we got her she was a big shedder. I researched food options and learned how important the 1st 5 ingredients are. Because we have cats, chickens and kids to feed, the high priced dog food was out. Iams still got good reviews and Walmart sells it at a lower price than the specialty pet stores. Our puppy is recovering from kennel cough, and she didn't eat for 3 days, so I just started her on the Iams and threw away the other food I was giving her. She seems to like it and has had no problems adjusting to her new food. She has only been eating it for a week, but she has gained weight and her shedding has greatly improved.I would definitely recommend this to anyone with a puppy.
Got my Doberman puppy at 8 weeks old. Switched her from the start to Iams Smart Puppy for Large breeds and within a week, her coat was glossy and she gained 3 pounds!! I Love Iams!!! :-)
When we found out we were going to adopt a puppy from the animal shelter, I began researching which food I wanted to switch him to. What he was getting at the shelter did not seem to be working. He had irritated skin, dull/thin coat, and poor digestion. The brands that would have been my first choice are out of our budget. Then I found Iams. It was budget conscious and had the health benefits that I was looking for. He's been on Iams for a little over a month and already this coat is shiny and thick. He is a longer haired dog and when we got him, the hair on his tail was thin and stringy - now you can tell the hairs are thicker and he has some fluff to his coat. The change has also helped with his digestion. I would definitely recommend a switch to Iams. When he ages out of the puppy food, he will still be an Iams dog.
My boyfriend and I adopted a parsons russell terrier that was 3 months old back in April 2012 and we were new pet parents who were under-informed. So we just bought a regular (kinda cheap) off brand dog food b/c we didn't think it mattered too much. About a week later we noticed large red balding spots on our sweet pup and were very concerned. We took him to the vet several times with the answer always being that it was just sensitive skin and to bathe him with special ($30# dog shampoo sold to us by the vet....which I did. That still didn't help so I did some research and found out the dog food we were feeding him was the problem....I felt terrrible! The food had too much corn in it and was causing his rashes. So we bought two differerent, very expensive, brands of organic dog food that I won't say the name of. But each time he wouldn't eat either one #neither would my roommates dog lol)....I suspected he did not like them. So I switched him to Iams Proactive Health, Smart Puppy dog food. He loves it, it is affordable and the best part is that his rashes have healed and we have seen no more of them pop up! Thanks Iams, our sweet puppy is now 8 months old, happy and healthy!
I work for animal control and I recently rescued a pregnant overbred pitbull. She was rescued by one of my coworkers and was treated for kennel cough. He found out that she was pregnany and scheduled her to be euthanized, but my heart dragged my across the shelter and I took her home. I started her on IAMS Pro Active Smart Puppy. She really likes the food. Well, she had 4 beautiful healthy boys. She is still eating the puppy food and not only does she look so much better and happier, but her puppies are EXTREMLY healthy and very smart. I'm glad I tried SMART PUPPY. I highly recommend this diet to everybody!
When we purchesed our Austraillian White Healer, Abby , We immidiatly put her on IAMS Proactive Puppy Chow! Our chiuaua has been on it for a couple of years and does wonderful. Her coat is always healthy and she is always full of energy! and very smart as well :)
I adopted my hound mix puppy that is 4 months old and they gave me the brand of dog food they were feeding her at the kennel, which was another brand of dog food. I brought her home and she would eat it and then throw it back up. So I called the vet and they suggested trying different dog food and I did try several and she threw them all back up. I then tried Iams puppy dry food and she loves and keeps it down..She is now a ver happy playful pup that loves her iams puppy treats and dog food. I love the fact that on the bag it tells you how much at their weight they should eat..Thanks iams for making my pup happy and healthy!!
I have a puppy & she was not eating food well. We got her from a freind that bottle feed her until 10 weeks. So I went to the store & got iams puppy. I was so surprized how fast she went to eating dry food. Now she is going to an iams for life.
To begin, I brought home my new puppy Pip, a Chihuahua 10 weeks of age last December. I wanted to give him food that was well priced and nutritional, and to top it off, that he would eat. I started off with a different brand of puppy food. He didn't like it much. So I switched to Iams Smart Puppy dry food. He Loved It! Not only was it decently priced, but it has all the nutritional value he needs. His coat became softer, and I could tell a difference of the way he was acting. He was more playful, and more of how a puppy should act. I've been feeding him it since. Now that he is almost 1, I will start giving him Iams Mini Chunks once his puppy food is out.
My dog is nearly 11 yrs old, and I wanted to be sure she was eating the best dog food for her. The IAMS web site suggested this choice, and my dog loves it. Hopefully, by eating right, she will be with me for many more years. I trust IAMS.
I never write reviews but my dog Ally loves the Iams proactive dry food for mature dogs. she never really ate with gusto but now she is ready and happy to have her dinner. It does my heart good to see her enjoying her food. Thanks!
This is a must have for my dog and having the 17.5 lb bag delivered right to my door was great.
Whatever was changed to make it "healthier" has made it unpalatable for my dogs.
We have had our senior dog on Iams Active Maturity for several years. We are having difficulty finding it in stores at this point and had to buy another brand. We were informed that food lines are being changed over and that is the reason for lack of availability. It's disappointing that we had to buy another brand and there is risk that sales will be lost because people had to go to another brand.
We have a male Dashshund that has arthritis very bad. This dogfood plus K-9 buffered aspirin and Cosequin has helped our dog to get around so much better and is doing so well this winter. This has surely worked for our Koko and our female dog is doing great too on this dogfood. They love this food! My husband and I highly recommend it.
We have a 12 year old Rotweiller mix, and she started having joint problems due to authritis. We have her on Glucosamine supplements and for a while it seemed to work, but she started having trouble again. We started her on this Premium Protection Senior formula and about a month later noticed a considerable difference in her movement. It doesn't upset her stomach and she seems to really like it. We will definately keep her on this.
love Iams pet food and having it delivered to my door is a great option.
Im not sure if I misread product info but the kibble is small.
My dog is an 8 year old Chocolate Lab and one of our family. I have always been worried about her health and longevity. She has eaten Iams since she was a puppy and her coat has always been beautiful, often commented on by passers by. When I saw the senior food we decided to try it. She likes the smaller pieces and actually lost a little weight; she is down to 96 pounds from 99 pounds. She has had no health issues at this point and we believe it is because of our food choice for her.
Here is the deal I had no way to get to the store and my dog was nearly out of food. So i decided to have it shipped to me. I was glad to find his food at a good price then I realized that the cost of shipping was almost not worth it. The lesson I have learned is not to wait until I'm out to order it.
I use it for my small dogs, and they love it. My morkie has lots of energy and always begs for it. We especially love the varity in flavor, she can be picky.
We adopted our dog from a friends brother and when we brought her home she was eating cheap dog food. Our dog itched constantly and I knew I had to do something about it. I had heard in the past that dog with skin problems often benefited from putting them on a lamb and rice formula. I have had dogs in the past and fed them nothing but Iams food. I, as well as my dogs loved it. I bought the Proactive Health Lamb and Rice formula and within the week our dog stopped itching. Thanks Iams for making a great product that my dog loves.
I have a shar pei/terrier mix who started having digestive issues in her older age. I tried the Lamb and Rice and her vomiting stopped! Since it worked for my dog, my mother tried it for her shih tzu and his intermittent vomiting stopped also!
Sometimes you really need to spread the word about some things that are very good and now that I have found this Lamb and Rice Iams i wouldnt trade for anything. I have tried every expensive dog food available. We were not satisfied until we found Iams Lamb and Rice formula.My large german shepherd was sensitive until I found Iams now I feed her twice a day and have had no problems. Thank you for your Lamb and rice formula.
I would highly recommend this dog food to anyone who has a larger sized dog.
My Josie not only LOVES the taste of this dog food, she is so much happier because her digestive problems have improved 100% with this food. In the past, I have tried every expensive dog food available. We were not satisfied until we found Iams Lamb and Rice formula. It's amazing. She's happy, healthy, and beautiful! I couldn't ask for more and thank Iams enough. She's not just a dog, she's our family member who we adore and want only the best for her! Thanks Iams from the bottom of our hearts!
Well I feed my dogs the lamb and rice, but its only as part of their diet, as I do mix all their meals with chicken, shredded carrots beans oatmeal & rice equal parts of each.This way they are not getting as much fat, but still taking care of all their needs nutritionally.
I have 3 labs that live in the house with us. We have been feeding with Iams since 2004. We now raise chocolate labs and I use the large breed puppy for them. If we try to feed them anything else they will not eat it. I think it makes there coat shiner and there teeth cleaner. I would and i do recommend to everyone, and when my puppies leave for there new home I send it with them.
My parents used to raise dogs in their kennel (name withheld as the kennel was discontinued many years ago). Their breeder friends told them about Joy dog food and its benefits. When Iams absorbed Joy, we automatically changed brands (which really wasn't changing brands). I am an Iams person and my dog is an Iams dog. Iams promotes the best digestion and has promoted it since before I knew about the product. The stool is solid and dark, the two things that any vet will tell you makes for efficient digestion. Withi efficient digestion comes excellent coat and skin, not to mention teeth and even blood and urine. Iams is an optimal food for dogs that leaves all the bells and whistles out, making more room for the nutritional value that a dog (and/or cat even) needs.
We have two dogs, a poodle mix named Zorro who is 5 and a Brittany Spaniel named Max who is 1. Of course there is a big difference in their size, but not in their food. We only feed them Iams Proactive Lamb and Rice. They both have the best skin any dog could have. Their teeth are cleaned by eating the dry Iams. Most of all they love the Iams Lamb and Rice Formula. We have tried other dog foods 2 times. What a mistake that was. They had skin problems and their stool had increased by at least 3 fold. We quickly went back to the Iams Lamb and Rice and their conditions cleared up quickly. We will never use another dog food again. Our dogs are precious to us as are our children. You would not feed your children sub-par foods so why feed your dogs anything but Iams. Thanks so much for making such a wonderful product. Zorro and Max thank you too!!!
My newly adopted dog did not eat any dog food- wet/dry, grain free, natural, organic etc. I had samples of everything and he did not eat any, he survived the week from the shelter from kid crumbs. Then I found him eating the cat food, which is Iams Healthy Naturals also! So I ran to the store and bought this and he gobbled it up! AMAZING! Thank you Iams! And it comes with $3 coupon
I have a dog that has problems digesting a lot of different dry dog foods. This one seems to get along with her digestive system and she likes it. I especially liked the fact that the first ingredient was chicken!
I have done a lot of research, and I care about what I feed my dog, and this food, for the price and ingredients is the best value! No fillers, by-products and no chemicals- just chicken, veggies and healthy digestible starches (no corn). My dog (male boxer, 2 years old) tolerates this food well and it has not caused him any digestion issues that other "natural" dog foods have in the past. Recommended to everyone, and was recommended to my by my vet so I have to trust his opinion and the results I see in my dog!!
It was nice just having a few clicks to order a 15lb bag of dog food and have it delivered (no extra charge!) to my door without having to go get it from the store (and hauling it to the car and then to the house). The quality of the product, of course, speaks for itself.
delivery was wondeerful and on time.
Very happy with this food 3 of my dogs were over weight, after feeding them Iams weight reduction dog food for 6 months they have lost the excess weight and look much healthier.I would highly recommend this dog food for overweight dogs.
He prefers Beneful Healthy Weight, but he eats this and seems to be ok with it.
My dogs love Iams and they haven't had any stomach problems like they used to. It's a little more pricey but I see a real difference in my pooches' happiness and health level, so it's worth it to me.
I bought this dog food and did not read the ingredients first. I will return and choose another Iams product. I don't want to feed my dog food that is mostly corn meal. I want something that is mostly meat, fruit and some veggies. This dog food has listed corn meal as the first ingredient, so I know that is what it is mainly made of. I know you have products with meat listed first, and I will select one of those even if they are not for over weight dogs.I not unhappy with Iams, but wish I had taken time to read the ingredients.
I have been using this dog food for awhile and have been happy with how my dogs continue to eat and seem t to enjoy.
My large mix breed, Lola has been losing at least two pounds per month. Not too much or too little for her health and exercise level. Her vet is very happy.
I buy this kind of Iams for my big dog Kirby the black Lab. He loves it. Just as long as he is happy and healthy that's all that matters.
Our dog has been eating this food since she was a pup. Only food we give to our dog!
I will never buy anything online again that has a rebate tag.
I did not get my rebate. I did not know how to contact Walmart to communicate the lack of the rebate. Will not purchase again
My dog maintains a healthy immune system, healthy coat and joint health with Iams dog food.
Everyone comments on how shiny their coats are and how much energy they have. They are 6 & 7 years old now.
I always fed my animals Iams. Dogs & Cat. For 10 years.As the cost was quit high I dropped my standards.I went to a different product. 10years ago. It seemed to maintain their health.Shiney coat, energy, good stools, etc.(We have 3 Doberman Pinschers. 2yr 4yr 8yr)6 months ago we started seeing an over amount of shedding. Though the company said nothing changed.Enough of he shedding. (Dobermans don't normally shed much) So I decided to return to Iams. The shedding stopped in 1 week. My 8yr old Doberman has a new spark about him. Eventhough he has been supplemented with Glcosamine-Chondroitin. We raised a beutiful healthy litter on the other food. We love all 4-legged kids. Keep up the good work Iams. I knew what to go back to.Sincerly,Glad to be back.
Keep up the good work!
Our Golden Retriever has been on Iams since he was a puppy. It was what our breeder was feeding, so we just continued using it when we brought Tucker home at 8 weeks old. He was on the Iams large breed puppy formula up until he was 7 or 8 months old and then we switched him to this Iams adult large breed and he has done wonderfully on it. He has a shiny and soft coat, lots of energy, and he is at a perfect weight for his age. He also seems to like this food. He always cleans his bowl. We are huge Iams fans. Our 4 cats also eat Iams cat food and our 10-year-old German Shepherd also eats this Iams large breed formula. We will continue using this food for our dogs! We are actually going to be getting a new Golden Retriever puppy this coming winter from the same breeder we got Tucker from and he will also be on Iams!
Our 120 lb Great Dane loves this food! We have tried all kinds of food, and this is the only kind that keeps him at a healthy weight and keeps his energy level high. We also feed the Iams Large Breed Smart Puppy food to our 20 week old Labrador Retriever. They both love their food... and come running when its time to eat.
The 4 lb bag of Iams was a temporary stand-in for one week. I am particular about food for my pets. This 4 lb bag lasted ten days whereas I only needed to have enough for 7 days. This was giving 1 cup in a.m. and 1 cup in p.m. until I got my check. My pet is 28 lbs and almost 4 years.I would buy again but, in a larger bag. Times are hard and I cannot afford expensive pet food from the vet as I used to. Still, IAM's is good food for pets.
I was blown away that I could order my puppy some dog food at walmart.com, what a convenience. Thanks Walmart!!!!!
I was using a Lite dogfood, and my 3 dogs were out of shape, much too heavy, even with a dry lite dog food. I switched to Iams weight control large breed dry food and the weight came off. It was like night and day, as they look and act like new dogs. Their vet is very pleased with everything with them now. Live and learn, because "lite" isn't always best.
I have an english mastiff with a thyroid problem. Actually, his thyroid doesn't work hardly at all. He was 5 years old when it stopped working and he went from a healthy active 190 lbs to 216 lbs and rising with no energy at all.Worried about his joints and health I took him to the vet and we started him on medicine. But the weight wouldnt come off. I talked to my vet and he recomended Iams weight control. To say the least Ozzy is back down to his 190 lbs and runs around like a puppy again. He's been on it for over a year now and his weight is the same give or take a couple lbs. I love this food for him and he likes it too! I recommend it to all my fellow pet owners for any type of breed cat or dog. So far they all agree...It's the GOOD stuff!
I have 3 dogs and the 2 adults (Yellow Lab and a Pit Bull) I feed the Large Breed Weight Control and it works great. The Lab was 110 in March and as of a few months ago he weighed in at 90! I feed my puppy the Smart Puppy food and she loves it. I will only buy Iams!
exceeds expectations,i get complements,on my puppy's,size shiny coat,how he's grown over night,how fast he learns and active.it's the best i ever bought if you try this product you wont buy nothing but iams products,they have me sold.
I have fed my bloodhound Iams large breed puppy food since I got him at 7 weeks old. He is now 18 months old. He has grown into a beautiful 110lb baby. His coat is so shiny. He has good bones and muscle.(sometimes not such a good thing when I am on the end of the leash). It is now time to switch him to adult food and after reading up, I will continue with Iams large breed adult food. It is the best on the market that is affordable.
I have a Saint Dane and a Great Dane and my puppies run in to eat every day twice a day!! I can tell they do love the food by how fast they dig in!! The amounts said to feed them also is pretty accurate, they are not to skinny or overweight.
We started our puppy on Iams® ProActive Health™ Smart Puppy Large Breed at 5 weeks old. She is now 8 months old and our vet says she is a picture of health. She is a lab mix and is currently about 60lbs, full of energy and is incredibly smart. She has taken vary well to training. She enjoys her food so much that she gets excited as soon as you touch her bowl. We often use a handful for for quick home training sessions. Her black coat is so smooth and shiny that it's challenging to take a clear picture of her. We're very pleased with this product.
Smart Puppy means smart puppy! Our 9 month old bullmastiff has been raised on ProActive Health Smart Puppy Large Breed food and is the happiest, healthiest, smartest little big girl if I do say so myself. Our older boy loved her food so much we have switched him to Iams as well. Great product at a great price! Thanks Iams! We are definately brand loyal to your products!!!
Our vet recommended this food over the other "pricier" options for our new Great Dane puppy. She LOVES the food and is always eager to eat. My Shih-Tzu has also taken to the food and loves it more than his regular food so we have swapped him to Iams as well. I was most concerned about our GD growing too fast (I've been told that if they grow too fast, which they will do on regular puppy food, that it will hurt them) and so far, 12 weeks in to using Iams, she is right on track according to our vet.
A high quality puppy food that is affordable and my dog loves. I have, and will continue to recommend Iam's products to friends and family.
I have been feeding my two weims large breed puppy since they were born. A perfect food for them and rather cost effective. But, Iams has really disappointed me. I cannot get my dogs the food they are used to and they are simply posting signs which say TRY ONE OF OUR OTHER FOODS. Come on. I'm not gonna feed my puppys a adult food because they screwed up and are not currently producing my dogs food. Pretty disappointed and think Iams should make it right with dedicated Iams customers. (this close to switching to purina pro plan)
Both my Labs have healthy, shiny, coats and love this food.
at the beginning Blu did not like the taste since she ate pedigree where she was born, I mix it with wet food from Iams and since then she eats like crazy, she love the taste and she even eat it dry.
Smart Puppy Large breed formula was recommended to us by our vet. however, I was a little taken back by the price of the food but still bought it. Our dog eats it ok but there is no flavor choice- it is what it is.Her growth is slowing some but I really hope it does help with the joint problems that "big" breeds are known for.
Thanks to Iams ProActive Puppy food for large breeds, our newest arrival, Chewy has a healthy start to his life. Thank you.
We adopted littermates, Labs- one black female named Roxy and one chocolate male named Marley.. They are approximately 5 months old and they are growing like weeds! We have had them on Iams Proactive Health Smart Puppy Large Breed formula for the past three months after our Vet recommended it due to their rapid growth. He said that the large breed formula would help to slow their rate of growth in order to allow for stronger bones and healthier joints. We have seen such an improvement in their overall health and coat. They are also extremely intelligent and happy pups. They seem to genuinely enjoy their feedings and look forward to their meals. Thank you Iams for such an awesome product! I know that I am doing everything I can to insure a long health life for our pets.
My vet is the one that recommended we feed our puppy Iams. We use Iams Large Breed Puppy because Iams takes into consideration the fast growth of this large breed. My puppy loves the taste of Iams. The vet is very happy with how his weight is and how he is growing. I believe it's because of the good quality dog food that he is eating. I won't use anything but Iams!
We got our puppy a few weeks ago, and since we've started feeding him Iam's LG. breed puppy food.. He acts so much healthier and his coat has changed dramatically! Very impressed!
I got my puppy from a shelter and they had him on a science diet, which I assume is organic,healthy food.I think Iams is good for him and he seems to like it.
My Japanese Chin (toy group, 7 lbs) pup 6 mos loves this dry food. She is a happy puppy, stools are smaller and less frequent and have almost no odor. She is also more content; has a skilly shiny coat. The ingredients seem to be healthy and natural, and the first ingredient listed is chicken, and not chicken meal. She loves the small kibble. Definitely would recommend this dry food to anyone considering it for their puppy.
I think most premium foods are probably good, but Healthy Naturals is working for us and I can't wait to go up to the adult size. I like the idea that you probably don't have to give a supplemental vitamin. Haven't tried mixing it with water, or adding sauce since he's eating it fine as it is but kind of like that sauce idea. That's probably more for me than him.
I think the food is awesome for our puppy.. I have tried both the lg. breed and the naturals! Both are great!
MY DOGS LOVE THIS DRY FOOD AND I RAISE YORKSHIRE TERRIERS.
My male boxer likes the taste of this dog food seeing as he always eats it all, but I have noticed a change in his behavior since feeding it to him. He used to be so full of energy running around playing with my children, but he just wants to lay around now.
my dog loves it.
We have a English Mastiff who would gulp down her food in a second flat which is not good because you run the risk of bloat. We bought this because the kibbles are big and she actually has to take her time eating it which is wonderful! She now has to chew her food instead of inhaling it. The taste must be great too because she loves it. We will continue to buy this each time it runs out.
I have tried to switch over the years and there is nothing that will replace Pedigree with my past and future Dogs. Two that have passed on were raised on Pedigree and they lived to be 14 and 15. My dogs now are 8 and 4 and there is no substitute.
for a little more cost got better quality food
Although he is more of a medium sized dog...the bigger kennels eork better on his old age.
My Alaskan Huskey, Loves Pedigree.
It was big & relatively inexspencive and my dogs eat it kind grudgingly BUT.... my vet said that its a sign that the dog isnt getting what they need from their food when they start digging in the trash or = tripple YUCK!!!!!= digging in the cat pan!!! Both of my dogs have suddenly started these desgusing habits since about a week after getting this stuff introduced into thier diet. Wont happen again!!!!
I LIKE the Pedigree Large Breed dog food for the price if .$19.98 for 36.4# its not a bad price and i have 8 dogs so when i go through 110lbs of food a week Walmart is where I buy some of my dog food and as I wk for a veterinarian office I do wont a good dog food to feed my dogs and walmart does have several dog food that is not good for dogs they do Carrie several good ones also and dog food health is very important to me and my dogsCL out witch veterinarian office I wk at www.cahpets.net in Lawton Oklahoma
I use this product to feed my 5 Labs. None goes to waste however they prefer other foods.I feel it is a good value for the money.
That is not a dalmatian on the package, it is a great dane. If you have a dalmatian, get the bag that's for Adult dogs, not this. All and all, great product and great value. I will continue to purchase this item.
The dog loves the food and home delivery is excellent!
We ate it all and it was DEEEEELICIOUS!! Great price for such a large amount of food. I will be ordering this from Walmart from now on and not buying it in the stores because of the value of it.
this brand of food I expected to be the best, then find out this brand of food is at the very bottom of the list. It is almost exclusively grains, NOT MEAT. Dogs are carnivores not omnivores nor vegetarians. Meat NEEDS to be the first ingredient and there should not be any corn. I wish they would change their formula.
I have 10 dogs, varying in weight from 10 to 70 pounds. Some of them have gotten a little "thick" and this food has stopped the gain, and they still love it as much as the regular Beneful. I buy around 8 of these every month.
This is a dog food I would recommend to anyone. My dog Bailey loves it.
I have a "healthy" weight dog and a thin dog. I don't want the thin dog to get heavy and I don't want the heavy one to gain weight so this is a great compromise and they both love the food. It's a win/win situation.
I have bought this product for years. My dogs LOVE IT. It maintains their weight and gives them more "pep to the step".
Walmart was quick in sending this and my dog is happy! She loves this dog food and is healthy and happy according to the Vet.
My adult dogs have been on Beneful for many years. My puppies were started out on Purina puppy food. It wasn't very long before the puppies got ino the Beneful bowl & preferred it over their food. Beneful provides the nutrients, vitamins, variety of flavors that my dogs love, and much more.
My older dog was having trouble with his food. Beneful provided much needed nutrients. All the dogs love it.
We've got 15 little dogs and they all like Beneful dog food.
It sounds funny since whose dog won't overeat? They don't seem hungry all the time when I feed them Purina One (meat is the first ingredient) instead of Beneful.
I save money by shopping online and I continue to save money by the items are shipped to my house free of charge. I saved all around
I ordered Beneful Dog Food and it was delivered to my door. It's a good brand and my dog loves it. I didn't have to load it into my car or haul it around before I got home. Walmart delivered and the dog and I are happy!
This is great for me. I have breathing problems and can't lift this large bag. It is the same price as at the store. The treats make up for the tax.
Great value for our pups! They love this food and the 31 lb bag still fits in the cupboard in the kitchen! I have this delivered to my home for free with Home Free! Thanks Walmart!
My dog eats this stuff, and he has yet to complain. I've tried it, and it's really not that bad, much cheaper then the food I normally eat. I would recommend, but be sure you have a glass of water near-by.
We have a 15# Chihuahua X and a 75# Catahulla Hound and THEY both love it. The Chi..use to get sick once or twice a mo. but hasn't once for over a yr now after switching to Beniful Healthy Wt. Won't buy anything else now ! !
Beneful has always done me and my dog right.After he ate this is energy and health is better and he is more active.Beneful really helped me and my dog I hope it will helps you and your dog.Watch your dogs health and activeness and see that Beneful really works(:
Payton my yellow lab really loves this and she looks so fit!
I found a puppy in a box in an alley. We took her home got home and cleaned up. I went to my local walmart to get her food. I have never owned a dog before, so it was all new to me to see all the foods available. I had no idea what to get for this new puppy, I had no idea what she was eating before or anything. There was a very kind woman who looked like she knew what she was doing.. haha I asked her and she recommended this. So I thought it couldn't hurt. My new puppy LOVES it. She hasn't had any problems with it upsetting her stomache or anything. She is doing alot better now and I'm very thankful to that woman.
I'll definitely check ingredients with the next bag of puppy or dog food.
From the age of 7 weeks to 6 months, I had my pup on the expensive grain-free dry kibble. She was free-fed (food out all the time) because she would only eat when starving. Dobermans only live 10-12 years and I wanted her to enjoy her mealtimes. Not only is she thrilled with the taste of Beneful, but she does not tire as easily when playing fetch or tug.....she literally runs laps around the yard at full speed! After only 2 days on Beneful for Puppies, she just feels better and that's what matters to me. She is not gassy like she was on the grain-free food; and her stool is NOT more smelly because she eats grain (in fact, it's less so#. Corn is not evil, and by-products and meal will NOT poison our animals #how ridiculous). I do put the contents of a fish oil capsule on top the Beneful -- I am a firm believer in fish oil for a dog's health. Beneful is NOT a hard food, so I do recommend having plenty of tasty chews on-hand to keep up their dental hygeine.
Theres nothing really to this product. Just give it to your dog and he/she will dpo the rest.
I tried Beneful Dried food for dogs because, i used to buy the same product for his wet food . They are very good and my dog likes them. What can i say. For his treats i buy Alpo, Pedigree and Purina products. And, honestly, where else you can buy cheap products for dogs, only at WALMART. You can compare everything, is really half of the price of the SAME products from Vons, Ralphs and Petco. I dont care if my place is in Santa Monica and i have to go all the way to Panorama City just to shop at my favorite store WALMART every 15days for anything we need. IT'S WORTH IT.
The dog likes it, great price
What more can I say other than that my dog loves it. She's a finicky eater but doesn't hesitate with beneful
My dog likes this product so therefore I like this product. However, he has not shown any improvement in his scratching. This is the second order so I am still hopeful. Have tried so many other products to no great relief!
My puppy loves this food. He wasn't eating enough of his more expensive food to gain the weight he should be gaining, so I decided to give this a try...he picks out the pieces of Beneful and won't eat the other food. He just begs for more Beneful when its gone. Very pleased with this product.
WE adopted our German Shepard/collie mix from the humane society 2 years ago. And when we first got her she was close to 100lbs. Our vet said this wasn't good for her hips or back since shepherds are prone to having bad hips so we she needed to lose between 25-30lbs. And since she's a very laid back and VERY lazy dog taking her for long walks was out of the question. We were already feeding her the original beneful and I just happened to see the healthy weight formula at the store one day. We decided it couldn't hurt to give it a try and after a about 2 months total you could really see a difference. The vet was pleased she had lost weight and was continuing to her goal. We're very happy with the results and continually switch between healthy weight and healthy radiance when she's had a few "to many treats". It's a great product that I know works and it is helping us help our "furry baby" have a happier, healthier life.
That protein isn't from good sources: it's from by products. That and the lack of a probiotic doesn't help promote a healthy immune system. It's also still primary a corn based kibble and includes wheat which gives a lot of dogs some digestive issues. And still... it includes the two ingredients reserved for the lowest of dog foods: food digest and sugar. There's just not enough that's beneficial in Beneful.
I have a 5 month old German Shepherd, and this gives him diarrhea. No kidding. All you need to do is look at the ingredients as to why. I switched him to Iams ProActive Health Smart Puppy Large Breed (an affordable product with chicken as the first ingredient) and he is a much happier puppy with a much happier GI system.
I needed the puppy food for my new puppy. She loves the puppy chow and Purina has been a very well=known product since I was child.
Not 8Lb Bags as stated on the website. I received 4 Lb Bags not 8Lb
However, I just bought the Puffs Plus Lotion and the quality is no better and there are 31 less tissues in the box. These are just average in every way.
I like these Puffs the best. I compare them to Kleenex 120 count 3 ply. No lotion on either. I have allergies and use a large amount of tissue. I find the basic puffs to be the best value if you use a lot of tissue. The two ply is sufficient and there are 60 more tissues to the box for roughly the same price as Kleenex.
I've used these for years. The description says it all "Soft & Strong".
These unscented Puff Ultra Soft & Strong Facial Tissues are just what I needed.Suffer with alergies and have tried several other brands but always come backto Puff.
This product is for my wife, and she likes how strong they are, and how well they hold up against heavy use ...
OH! so soft
The quality of the tissue is a little thin, but useable...my main problem with this product..it is not the "POP-UP" style I prefer, like Kleenex, that pop up through the top one at a time...these are flat folded on top of each other, sounds like a silly issue, but if you want to put them in a decorative box it will not work.
other than harder than heck to pull out of the box withoutripping to shreds/ no complaints.
I actually live overseas at a DPO address where paper products are poor quality and expensive. Few stores seem to offer quality tissues for purchase online and shipment to a DPO. THANK-YOU Wal-Mart for finally doing so. I love Puff's brand tissues. Soft, sturdy and a cute box. Glad I can order these online now!
Great to keep on hand! Nice for keeping from getting a sore nose. Are strong and gentle. But beware that you don't clean your glasses with them!
Puffs plus are wonderful. They are strong and gentle when I have a cold and use tissues repeatedly. If I have to use other tissues then my nose gets raw and red. This doesn't happen when I use puffs plus. I also love the vick's puffs plus when I have a cold. They are wonderful!
I like Puffs tissue products. The lotion addition makes them easy on sensitive skin. They arrived well in their own clear wrap and in a carton. This 3pk included bonus store coupons which makes it a super buy!
The only tissues we use!
Didn't come smashed when arrived and are perfetly soft.
My family prefers these with the lotion so they dont rub their noses raw. Good Quality and a Good Buy.
Puffs are the only brand I buy! I have tried other brands in the past and am never happy.
I have allergies. Puffs softest and strongest. I appreciate savings on value pack and happy available in non-lotion as I am sensitive to fragrance. They are soft and work great without lotion. Love my Puffs
I like the product.
good tissues have always liked puffs.
It is great to have Kleenex delivered to your door at such low prices. How convenient is that?
being confined to my home mostly, i so appreciate walmart offering needed products at such great prices and most especially free shipping on most items. thanks!
Tissues,,, hm..I ordered some to see what would happenOddly enough, tissues doen't travel wellI recommend that you buy them only along with cotten balls and Q-Tips, etc.Antything else of substantial mass will bludgeon them to a pulp.
A fine product that has been around for many years. But I want to know why Walmart does not offer a three-pack of the larger (280 count) boxes of Kleenex?
Kleenex is strong, soft, and this big box fulfills our needs for at least a week. Love the 3-pack.
Kleenex is most reliable tissue. This is a good value.
it came here quite fast, i was surprised .and on a saturday. it's a great value, now i don't have to resort to using paper towel to blow my nose.
Soft tissue, pretty foil box.
It's worth buying and using it!
this is great because my family goes through kleenex like crazy so big packs are the way to go
I love these Kleenex. They are soft enough so that they don't make your nose sore when you have to use one after another due to cold or allergies. But what I like best is that they are soft without the lotion, so they don't leave behind that yucky lotion feeling on your upper lip. I hate that! And if you've got a cold or suffering from severe allergies...I HOPE YOU FEEL BETTER SOON!
nice choice and fast delivery.
Works nice for the office having small boxes of tissues available instead of large space hoggers.
Just a plain kleenex, no lotions or smells. Strong
Very soft, durable tissue with no scent! Great for allergy season and the like.
I always count the number of sheets per roll as this helps figure your cost per roll. The Angel Soft rolls I usually buy have 300 sheets per roll and these have considerable less. This was not indicated online. These also have a larger cardboard roll inside so the outside of the roll looks the same size as other rolls. I do like this tissue as it seems better quality than the cheapest and for me its the best overall deal if I can find the rolls with 300 sheets.
Wow this is the only bathroom tissue I buy
WE HAVE A SEPTIC TANK. WOULDN'T TRUST ANY OTHER BRAND. WORKS IN RV'S TOO. NEVER HAD A PROBLEM. LOT CHEAPER THAN THE RV TOILET PAPER.
Rolls ae small and to go very fast but I switched from a store "value brand" that was just as inexpensive and for the cost and purpose it is used for I would buy it again mainly because the quantity does keep me from having to go out just for t.p.
I have used Angel Soft for over 7 years and would never consider using anything else. I am very picky about toilet tissue and this is always one of the least expensive brands, soft and durable. I have recommended this product to my friends. It also lasts longer than other brands.
Angle soft toilet tissue is excellent. It is not to soft and not to rough. It does the job and is not quite as expensive as so others. But is also not as cheap as so of the others available. I would recommend at least trying this product.
I've bought no other brand of TP for over 15 years and to be able to order this and have it delivered is such a blessing, especially since I am disabled. Their commercials do not lie - the product truly IS the ideal balance of softness and strength, and I couldn't imagine using anything else in my home!
I like this product very much. Big roll that lasts longer and very soft. Good value for your money.
Got lots of rolls - pretty print - ordered double rolls - I'd hate to see the single rolls - My bad, did not pay attention to the ply - I ordered single ply, but I prefer 2-3 ply bathroom tissue - Angel Soft will do in a pinch, but will not be my regular brand.
It's a good price for the product but sometimes when you use it, it tends to stick to you and I don't like that. It is a little too thin too. If it was a little thicker then I think that would solve the problem of it sticking to you. Only problem that I have with it. It is a good price for the value. I just wish that the manufacturers would make scented bathroom tissue again, I loved that stuff!
I was surprised when i got it, it is twice the sheets of the ones we have in our local mom and pops store...i highly recommend...you won't be disappointed.
When I must go to the store I cannot walk and need to use a handicap scooter. These scooter have small basket, now I have the option of buying online and having my purchases delivered to my home. Most of the large items that I need I purchase online. I am waiting for walmart.com to open up more products for home delivery.
Not bad for the price, just a little on the thin side.
I have used this product for quite some time and I like it.
this toilet paper is soo soft and nice... it just what a person needs to feel clean at all times. i buy this product every chance i get,,,its soft baby..........
I use angel soft all the time, its a good brand and its cost effective. Next to charmin its a very good product !!
When I order this tissue I thought I was ordering the tissue the that came in the blue pack. The problem I have with the purple pack is itdoesn't last very long.
scott extra soft is great + with free ship to home ideal!!does not stop up plumbingdoes not leave lots of fuzz + dust all over everythinglasts a long time and is soft
I am a practical shopper and for the money in this hard economy with a family this Scott Extra Soft Bath Tissue Double Roll, 24 pk is the best buy.
I only gave this item 3 stars only because the product is not your average size tissue that you would get in a 12 pack of this same brand, they are much smaller and do tend to go faster than the average size roll. Over all though the tissue still does the job it suppose to do : )
I like the original better, this type has much less on the roll
I alway use Scott 1000 - I thought I would try this - it goes very quickly - We used one a roll a day
I always use Scott in my life but for some reason the extra soft one runs out very quick. But it is a good bath tissue.
I dont like this as well as the regular Scott toilet tissue. It does not lastnearly as long. That is why I buy Scotts in the first place. So i haveto give this a big thumbs down. Was very dissapointed.
I purchased this tp after it was recommended on a blog I was reading as a great deal. It IS a great price for tp but isn't as soft as the Kirkland tp we were using. It is also strangely shorter than regular tp rolls, maybe that's how they can sell it for such a great price? I wouldn't say I hate it but I don't love it either. I think in the future I would rather purchase something just a tad softer on sale instead.
Great TP.
I am a single woman and I buy this product on a regular basis. They are quilted, absorbent a good value and the larger size pack keeps me from running out until my next full shopping day.
My mother tried to tell me Scott toilet paper (especially this one - which is what I bought) does not compare to others; she said my dad refuses to use it because his fingers break through. As gross as it is to talk about this, it is TRUE. This stuff is terrible and I will never buy it again. Compare another brand (even an off-brand) and you will see this tissue is inferior. I bought it because it was on special at Walmart and looked like a deal - NOT A DEAL AT ALL!!!! I should have listened to my mother!
I usually buy the regular Scott. The Extra Soft goes twice as fast. Ordered in error. Will not buy again. Rated 2 stars because I like Scott brand better than others.
Soft and gentle, but a little too easy to accidentally poke your fingers through.
Absolutely great!... does a wonderful job for nose blowings, all the way to.... you know.... other stuff that you might need it for!
Good if your users focus on how much the roll off. it is like using a sheet of bounty paper towel if you do not pay attention on how much comes off.
No matter what other paper arrives on the market or who else puts a new one out, this will always be my favorite. It works. It works the way I expect it to; it works the way my family likes it to; it works the way it always has. It works.
This toilet tissue is two layered and soft. I prefer the Scott 1000 roll tissue that is not extra soft. Our family of seven uses too much of this tissue too quickly.
I only buy Scott Extra Soft. The rolls last way longer than the cheaper stuff. Also it is sturdy but still soft. It holds together better so you don't have to use as much. Also, the price on this at walmart.com is awesome!
Great Product, value, and delivery.
This the worst toilet paper ever. There's only four people in my house and we have to put a roll almost every day. I will never buy this again.
i would purchase this product again!!!!
this tissue feel like you are using paper towels, so thick, hope it don't stop up my toilet...... it don't last long and the rolls is small.
This tissue paper is too soft. It falls apart when used. Not good.
Love that I get this in big packs dont have to shop for it so often !!
I admit that I used to hate people who talked about, wrote about or thought about toilet paper but this product deserves a little praise. It works. The weight is just right and it doesn't fall apart when you are using it.
Gets the job done
I bought this thinking it would be wider and cover the toilet paper holder completely like toilet paper used to because it says 4.2 x 4.0. However, I measured the roll and it is 5/8" narrower on the holder than the Scott 1000 roll which says 4.1 x 3.7. Can't figure that out, but it is way too narrow for my liking. It is thicker and a little softer than Scott 1000, but it doesn't last as long. I weighed it, and it has 3 & 7/8 oz of paper, while the Scott 1000 has 7 oz. of paper. The Scott Extra Soft is about a penny per ounce more than the Scott 1000. Since the Extra Soft has about half the toilet paper per roll, you will be changing the roll twice as often.
This is the best brand for your money. The sheets are soft and absorbs great. You can use less sheets at a time. I will for one NOT CHANGE my brand.
The quality of the Scott Extra Soft is awersome, no tearing at inappropriate moments. The value is great, I used to purchase another brand with coupons. The Scott brand I don't even need a coupon it is usually less expensive.
THIS TOILET PAPER IS HORRIBLE! IT MIGHT BE CHEAP AND SOME MIGHT SAY ITS GOOD---BUT FOR ME--I HATE IT! EVERYTIME I USE IT---SMALL PIECES OF IT STICKS TO MY BODY---AND THAT ISNT PLEASANT! SO---I WILL NOT BUY THIS AGAIN.
quality and price good
VERY EFFICIENT AND PERFECT COST WISE WILL RECOMMEND
this product is need improvement.it is a good price.
The price was great and delivered in a timely manner.
this was a wonderful price and it arrived within a good peroid of time
Great value and great product. The fact that I can get it shipped to my house is a HUGE bonus!
Fast shipping, good overall value.
I love it! It's strong and does not break apart easily. I use less toilet paper too!
great value for a great product beats bulk stores for same items hands downI should have brought more thanks for a great deal
I GUESS THE PRICE WAS OK BUT AFTER LOOKING VERY CLOSE TO THE ADD IT MADE ME THINK THEIR WAS 48 ROLLS NOT 24.
Great product for the price!!
This toilet paper is very strong, but not soft at all. It's too rough for me.
I love all of Scott's products, especially the toilet tissue. I saw the price and I had to purchase even though I never ordered toilet tissue over the internet but it was an internet price so why not!
not too thin and not too much to waste.just what you need.
lasts my family of four between 3-4 months
I love it because it's not a monster fluffy roll that doesn't fit into my old house's built-in toilet paper holders.
less than a dollar a four pack and its scott how can you go wrong with that?
durable, soft-enough, doesn't tear during process - - - GREAT to able to have DELIVERED TO MY DOOR.
Cons: This toilet paper is very thin so need to use more sheetsPros: There is more paper in these rolls than mostConclusion: balances out
Used this product in the past and we all liked it. This is a much softer and nicer than regular Scott tissue. Nice to have delivered to your home.
Good deal for good bath tissue.
No complains and at the same time nothing to brag about.
I like the Double roll, 24 pack, It lasts longer and doesn't clog my commode. I was having problems with flusing and overflowing with another tissue, but since I changed to Scott, this no longer happens.
I used Home Free. When the delivery came, I started to relax, but not too soon.
great vale for the quantity!
I have used this product for years and have been very satisfied.
We love the extra soft! Easy on the bottom.
IT'S A GOOD DEAL ON THE TOILET PAPER BUT THE ONLY THING IS WHEN U WIPE IT BREAKS FAST BUT BESIDES THAT IT'S SOFT & THE PRICE IS GOOD
I love this product!! As advertised, it's double ply, thick rolls and very soft.
Best value on line
quality paper, right price, but could be "bigger"... as it runs out too fast....1000 sheets, better product...
...but no more! I like that Scott is more septic friendly without taking away from comfort and strength. Factor in that it's a better value for my money and I'm a convert.
For the price and the quality of product this met my expectations! It's septic safe, which is a big plus also.
Great Product!
good price , had to order online cuz they were out of stock in store.
As it's a bulky purchase, it's very convenient to have it delivered to the hosue.
I love Scott Naturals. The Naturals are the only ones with 2 ply, providing more thickness and absorption when used. Nice soft tissues and being able to buy the 18ct online makes my Walmart shopping experience much easier as it's not offered in my Walmart store. I would recommend Scott Naturals to everyone. It's made from natural materials so it's okay to flush for septic tanks.
Tissue is described on package, very soft.
Don't have to tell anyone how expensive tp has gotten or how much smaller it is or how much less is on a roll. Everyone is picky about tp for their bum, and soft is usally the main thing we want. While this is soft it is not as soft as Meijer brand, I love their tp. Also this is one ply however it seems to be a thick one ply and you do not need to double the amount for use. I would recommend this if you have a lot of girls in the house since we sit down to use the bathroom more than half the time. Might not recommend for anyone with bum problems as it might not be soft enough. But their is a lot of paper on the rolls and more than any other double rolls I have bought.
For the price, this is a great value. My only complaint is that one 12-pack, even they're supposedly double rolls, does not last as long as I expected,which is why I purchase 2-3 packs at a time, about every three to four weeks.
It's soft, medium thickness & strength.Rolls are a little bigger than the average and last a little longer.The larger multi-packs are usually better value.
yes it is very good in price because i went to the store and they wanted 14.00 for the 24 rolls
hey it is great stuff---do not buy the cheap stuff
I have tried many brands but this is by far my favorite.
best
thought this was a really good deal but it is a really thick ply so we use much more and it is being used up at twice the rate of the brand we used previously. it's very soft but feels wasteful.
Good amount of product for the money - also cheaper online than in-store, so a very good deal.
Nice ultra soft tissue.
top quality by price that i have found especially for older people!
I prefer Charmin to any other brand of toilet paper, it is stronger and last longer.
This is one of the strongest, yet soft toilet tissues that I have ever used. Just wish that toilet tissue was not so expensive. Charmin is the only brand for me.
This is perfect for my family. Not only is it stronger and softer, but we use WAY less. 2-3 sheets is perfect for each use. May spend a little bit more to begin but you save more because you don't use as much.
I love Charmain. I use to buy the cheap brands and would have to use way too much and it was rough to boot. I started buying the Charmain 2 ply and noticed I don't use near as much, so it lasts longer, there by, costing about the same when it's added up. And oh, so much softer!
As for me and my family, we are only Charmin. I absolutely cannot use any other toilet paper than the Ultra Soft. My dad will only use the Ultra Strong. You get what you pay for especially when it comes to toilet paper. We've tried small packs of other cheaper brands when we've been out, and I almost dread having to use it. Ultra soft is still strong but super soft, and we just love it, won't use anything else.
This 12 pack of Charmin Mega Toilet Tissue is both soft and strong. Large size is very convenient. Product is very fairly priced.
Toilet tissue is a necessary item to purchase. It is much better when one purchases this item in bulk; however, it is frequently difficult to do. Charmin is a fantastic brand. I was impressed with the good price for a 12 count package. Delivery was prompt.
This is not the first time I have used this product. It is excellent!
Free shipping on this item rocks! don't have to lug paper products inside anymore.
This is an excellent product, the only brand I buy since I discovered it. Your pricing was comparable to local purchase. I continually recommend this product to others.
I love being able to buy a large-quantity package of my favorite toilet paper online at such a great price. The product was delivered in only two days and I bought enough 12-packs to last for half a year. Thank you, Walmart!
I just love the mega rolls! They are just perfect for a family of 5!
I like the size of the mega rolls. Lasts longer. It doesn't rip when you use it[ the strong rolls.]
the tissue is strong and quality good, but there is not enough tissue on the roll
I buy this toilet paper all the time. But recently I purchased a large amount from walmart and thought it was gonna be a great deal. Come to find out the toilet paper feels more like the Charmin ultra soft and not the ultra strong I wanted. It is all crumbly leaving a nasty film of toilet paper on you after using the product. When you take out a new roll it seems to already be falling apart. Its terrible not sure if this is Walmart's fault or Charmin's but I will no longer be purchasing this product.
This was a great delivery made right to my door, and with the other items I purchased arrived quickly and free delivery.
I have tried about every toilet paper and this is the only one strong enough to do the job that didn't leave a layer of cotton fibers behind.
I have tried all kinds of Bathroom Tissue. Charmin Ultra Strong is the best value and the best product. Some people don't mind using four, five or more pieces to get the job done and at the same time keep the fingers clean. Why count to five (or waste an unknown amount of paper) when three will do it?It’s soft, none abrasive, and stays strong before dropping it.
Charmin is still the best toilet paper to use. Thick and absorbant, the paper weave will not tear or fall apart during use. You use much less paper too, saving a little on your budget and on trees.
I like soft but strong tissue and this one meets my expectation very well! And the delivery was on time!
although this is my first time using this product, I am okay with it and I would recomend it, the only down side is the same thing I've noticed with other bathroom tissue, the rolls are getting smaller and the prices are getting larger.
Only TP I'll buy!!!
I switched to this once I read about more never ending changes with Charmin Basic. This has 176 sheets per roll, and not worth the price increase. A bit disappointed that I could not find the sheet count before purchasing. Charmin Basic is a better value.
Love this stuff.
Great value and I appreciate it being shipped to me. I hate carrying stuff like this on the bus!
Great TP, only complaint is that the paper crumbles and little pieces fall all around.
buy it
really soft and strong.well worth the price.
I cannot emphasize how much I love this TP! Unlike other products that are flimsy, fall apart, and seem to be made of half a ply, this TP is soft, thick, and has lots per roll. Consequently, you can use less, and also feel cleaner and less irritated.
Rolls last a long time, and the 9-count is a better value.
I was so pleasantly surprised by the high quality and softness - it even beats Cottonelle for thickness of individual sheets. It says on the front that it never felt so good to use less and for the first time a product really does what it says.
The products are good. I received the products on time.
very good , saved me gas to buy this and the price was right!
Colgate is a reputable product, so no complaints there. The boxes were shipped in a bag-like package, so the contents were really squashed during delivery. Somehow the toothpaste was a little runny when it came out of the tube. The value is still a good one and I appreciate that Walmart offered it via the internet. Hopefully, the shipping will be better the next time.
I am so glad to be able to find the toothpaste with the flavor I've always prefered. And, it comes in a value size and helps my money go farther.
Its one box that looks like 2 individual packages, we use Colgate only i think is a tradition inour household - and no cavities!
I like the fresh taste and feel of this tooth paste, and the price was great. This will be another purchase I will be making again.
Bought this product took out of package and noticed the actual toothpaste tube was made of an alternative material. I can only assume it is supposed to be good for the environment, which is a great idea, but it broke as soon as I went to squeeze out the first bit of toothpaste. It exploded rendering the entire tube unusable! DO NOT BUY!
Love this toothpaste; have been using it for years.
i needed to find a toothpaste that was good for me. so this was my natural choice. have used this for years. so if you need a good toothpaste then this is it. it is a good value for the money also
This toothpaste has a great taste to it. This is a great price for 2 tubes.
Very refreshing, way less dripping than other toothpaste. I like gel toothpaste now.
I was in eager need of toothpaste for my child. I went to Walmart, grabbed it, and thought I will give it a shot. GREAT! This toothpaste isn't runny, it's thick. All you will need is a little on the brush. Cleans the teeth so well. No tartar at all on my child's teeth. Freshens breath. Love it! Its hard to find at other locations. But it is worth the money.
This toothpaste is colorless and very runny. After I apply paste on a brush I always wet it before using. This toothpaste went right thru the bristles. The only good thing is that is it fluoride free. I didn't want to give this product any stars but Walmart won't let me finish this review until I click a few. If I could see this product and it was a little thicker I would have been happy to give it a few more stars.
Out of the 3 major companies, Orajel has the most flavor options for non-fluoride toothpastes. My daughter seems to like all of them. For the reviewer that complained about it being runny, it's only that way because you wet your toothbrush afterwards, thus diluting the toothpaste and making it runny. If you want the brush wet, wet it before applying the toothpaste. Problem solved! Really though, all of them work the same, so choose whichever one. You can get coupons for the Orajel and Aquafresh kind on their websites. (Haven't tried the Tom's kind, but out of the 3 we have, Aquafresh is the cheapest, and the Orajel brand sometimes comes in a bonus size that gives you a 2 oz, typically the Orajel and Aquafresh are 1.5, so you're getting more paste for your buck with the colgate at 1.75 oz unless you find a bonus size of the Orajel.)
I have been using the Colgate total advance for about 4 months now, and I can tell you it works. Forget buying Listerine whiten rinse, this toothpaste works better, and cheaper. Another product you would want to use after brushing your teeth would be the Act fluoride rinse, trust me, you will see results :)
this product is real good for the teeth..i really like this product..
I've been using this toothpaste for four years and I have NEVER come across the "problems" that others are experiencing. If you are rough with the lid, of course it's going to break. My only beef with this product is the small tube and how quickly I'm always having to buy a tube. For the price I've been paying for the past 4 years, I'd like to at least get more.(hide full review)I've been using this toothpaste for four years and I have NEVER come across the "problems" that others are experiencing.

My husband and I both love Crest Products but the packaging you are using for the new toothpastes are really not designed well. On the 4 tubes of 3D Advanced White that I have purchased the top has broken in the first week. I have been using your products my whole life and have never had this kind of a problem. The toothpaste then gets hard on the top and when you do get it to come out it runs all over the place. I have thrown 3 tubes away half empty. Please fix this, I would hate to go to the other side. It seems I am not the only one that is having these problems.(hide full review)My husband and I both love Crest Products but the packaging you are using for the new toothpastes are really not designed well.

When my wife and I saw the 3D Toothpaste, we couldn't wait to try it. The first time that I opened the lid to use it I knew that there was going to be a problem.The second time I used it the lid hinge broke and the lid fell off of the tube. My wife said that hers fell off on the fourth time she used it. When the paste got down to where there was only a small amount left, you can't squeeze out the rest because of the oversized cap. We would buy this product again only if Crest would put on the regular screw cap like the ones on most other tubes of toothpaste.Thank you,Danny(hide full review)When my wife and I saw the 3D Toothpaste, we couldn't wait to try it.

with constant use, you can see the difference. Love this!!with constant use, you can see the difference. Love this!!
I do love the actual product; however, the packaging fails to meet expectations. The cap consistently breaks at the hinge. I have seen prior reviews dating to May 2010 where this is "addressed" by a reply that it is working on being fixed. However, I have seen no progress to date. The other option given is to use it as a screw cap. While this may be a viable solution, I still find that a product with a specific purpose should serve that purpose. Crest should demand better quality from their supplier of these caps. I cannot recall an instance where the actual hinge lasted as long as the tube of toothpaste and often the hinge breaks within the first 15 uses.(hide full review)I do love the actual product; however, the packaging fails to meet expectations.

Crest couldn't pay me to use this product. The top of the tube is not secure enough and tooth paste will start to come out around where the tube ends and lid is connected.Crest couldn't pay me to use this product.

I've been using this product for several months. At first it seemed to whiten a little, but I don't see any further appreciable change. And I agree with other reviewers about the tube design: flip cap is awkward to use & it is near on impossible to get last of the toothpaste out. All I get at the end is a lot of the "clear" whitener (peroxide?) and no white toothpaste. Your response to previous reviews citing the problem with the flip cape were helpul; I'll try to just unscrew the cap(hide full review)I've been using this product for several months.

Result was actually seen after 1st use making me quite impressed.I can say though I'd l ike to see a little bigger tube for the price or a lower price tag on it. I only bought 1(even though we are a family of 5)but we have spent more than our fair share of products "claim" results visible within as little as 7day's. Quite refreshing to find1 that not only worked but also tasted great also.I have already recommended this product to several family & friends.

I've been a coffee drinker since I was 10 and had the subsequent coffee stains. The only way to make them go away was to visit a dental hygienist. I tried the Crest 3D White Advanced Vivid and after 2 weeks the stains were gone. The ad says it removes 90% but it removed 100% for me. As far as getting all the toothpaste, there's a clip you can buy that fits on the bottom of tubes and slides up as you use the paste.(hide full review)I've been a coffee drinker since I was 10 and had the subsequent coffee stains.

For two months I have brushed my teeth twice daily using Crest D White. I have used a Crest battery powered toothbrush and brush at least two minutes each time I brush. To this date there has been absolutely no improvent in the color of my teeth. Because of all other experience with P&G products. We use all P&G products in our home.

started using this several weeks ago. purchased BECAUSE it said to whiten teeth. have tried others never noticed anything. will not use strips, afraid of a sensitivity problem. any hoo, it really works. noticed this just last night. having my teeth cleaned etc every 6 months does nothing. 4 front bottom small teeth really beginning to show their age and mine. but by golly they ARE whiter. this from someone who has used a leading cleanser for over 40 years, once a month and yes my dentist knows it. thinks i'm a nut says not to do anymore then what i presently do. BUT it has never made these teeth look any whiter.. thanks for a great toothpaste.(hide full review)started using this several weeks ago. purchased BECAUSE it said to whiten teeth. have tried others never noticed anything. will not use strips, afraid of a sensitivity problem. any hoo, it really works. noticed this just last night. having my teeth cleaned etc every 6 months does nothing. 4 front bottom small teeth really beginning to show their age and mine. but by golly they ARE whiter. this from someone who has used a leading cleanser for over 40 years, once a month and yes my dentist knows it. thinks i'm a nut says not to do anymore then what i presently do.

I have never written a review on a product, but the design of this toothpaste tube cap is absolutely terrible. It is very messy. It gets in the way of the toothpaste and toothbrush. When the toothpaste gets on the cap, it's a mess to clean up and most of the time prevents the toothpaste from getting on the toothbrush. It also breaks off the tube and creates another mess. I have used Crest toothpaste for many years, however, I am thinking about changing brands because of the toothpaste tube cap.(hide full review)I have never written a review on a product, but the design of this toothpaste tube cap is absolutely terrible.

I bought this toothpaste before I went on vacation and I was really excited to try it out. I've used Crest ever since I was little and I've always been satisfied with their products. The first three days I tried Advanced Vivid Toothpaste, I didn't seem the results I was looking for, but my teeth felt so smooth and clean. I've been using it for about a week and my teeth are beginning to show some progress in the whitening department. I'm happy with my purchase, but I was expecting the whitening to begin in the first 3 days. And unfortunately, the flip-cap to my tube broke the first time I used it.As far as the whitening goes, I think I prefer the strips. :](hide full review)I bought this toothpaste before I went on vacation and I was really excited to try it out.

Noticed a friend's smile getting brighter and she put me onto the mouthwash. I did one better and got the toothpaste and mouthwash as well. In less than two weeks have noticed a brightening and without the sensitivity of a brightening product. Will continue to use as the results are already showing.

I have noticed a much whiter appearance in my teeth after using the Crest Advanced Vivid toothpaste. However, I wish there was a larger size available.

I love the Crest 3D white products! The only problem is that the container is not very practical. I have bought the toothpaste more than 5 times and the cap always breaks off! Plus, it is always very hard to get out when you get to the end. I would reccomend this product to anyone just plan to have to buy another tube when it's only about half way gone!

I was skeptical about how effective this product would be because of the price but I have honestly seen great results in the two weeks I have been using the toothpaste. My teeth are at least two to three shades whiter and many of my friends and family have noticed and asked me if I have gotten my teeth professionally whitened!

Seemed to work very good. One problem---- after 4 uses, the cap, which is a hinged plastic cap, broke when I opened it. Very cheaply made. It is my only complaint.Seemed to work very good.

The toothpaste itself is great, but the packaging is not up to P&G's standards. The top easily breaks, leaving you with an unworkable mess of a "tube".The toothpaste itself is great, but the packaging is not up to P&G's standards.

The Vivid 3D White Toothpaste is ok but........the paste hardens around the top of the tube...therefore drying out the paste before all is used. I've tried making sure the top is always closed but somehow, the top does not close properly. This is about the 4th or 5th tube I've purchased (slow learner???) and they all do the same. This is an expensive product (comparatively) and it would appear that some one hasn't done their homework on usage....75 to 80% is about all I've been able to use.Just saying......Probably not going to purchase again if I can remember the non-usage!
I was real suspicious of all the perfect reviews this toothpaste had received on here. I saw pages of perfect 5 star ratings in a row! To get this many perfect reviews for any product is nearly impossible. So I had to give it a try. I take good care of my teeth and I'd say before trying my teeth were a 6.5/10 on a white scale. Well I used the 3D vivid for 14 days now twice a day and sure it foams and tastes good but I did not see any improvement in whitening. I'm very dissapointed. If my teeth aren't going to get whiter there's lots of cheaper toothpastes that work well so why pay more for 3D? This product was not groundbreaking in anyway as far as whitening unfortunately.
After using once a day for 4 days I already notice a difference! My teeth are definitely quite a bit whiter. I can't wait to see what my teeth will look like after the 14 days that the box states that 80% of stains will be removed. It has a very fresh taste and makes my mouth taste and smell fresh for a few hours longer than my regular toothpaste. I don't think I would recommend using this more than once a day because although this does say that it does not harm enamel, it doesn't have the ADA seal. I love this paste!
This is by far the best toothpaste I have ever used. I've used a lot of different ones in the past and they just didn't seem to be working for getting my teeth whiter. I'll be the first to admit that I had poor brushing habits but after using this stuff I haven't stopped using it since. Been using it for about 4 weeks now in combination with the mouthwash and love it. After the first couple of days I noticed that my teeth were getting whiter. My bf even complimented on how white my teeth were. I even got him to start using it too.
I have always been a Crest lover, and 3D White is better than any toothpaste I've used! I love the clean taste and the feel of the cleaning particles in my mouth! I've noticed a difference in my teeth and their whiteness! Every thing except the packaging is perfect. If you read this my Crest 3D creators,PLEASE fix the tube!! The cap breaks off easily and the shape of the tube makes it hard to squeeze, particularly when you reach the end of the tube. I'd much rather have the regular tube for 3D!Thanks for a great product that makes me feel like I've just visited my favorite hygienist!!
I've been a heavy coffee drinker for years and my teeth are yellowed. I really hoped that this product would work for me. I've been using it faithfully every day for the past month but have seen no difference in the color of my teeth.Also, the cap will not stay shut so the tube keeps getting clogged with dried toothpaste. Every morning I have to scrape the dried toothpaste out of the opening before I can squirt new toothpaste out.I gave this product 3 stars because it freshens my breath better than any toothpaste I've ever tried before. However, I'm going move on and try another product to whiten my teeth.
i thought it was going to be junk but it was great i had yellow teeth but this brought it back to white and i did not need to see a dentist and spend 100s of dollars i reccemend it to every one who ha bad teeth
This toothpaste rocks! My teeth have whiten and I have proof that my teeth have whiten, pictures! I took these before and after pictures. The total length of time between the first day of using the toothpaste is 17 days.
I thought I should write because I have never has such a hard time getting the paste out of the tube as I did with the Crest 3D Advanced vivid. Why does the container have to have six tiny holes in the lid, rather than one large one? When you get halfway through the tube, it becomes increasingly difficult to get any paste out. I have now thrown out the rest of the tube, even though there was quite a bit left in it. Don't mind the toothpaste, but can't stand the container!
The reviews seemed pretty good so I bought, not expecting much since I've tried everything when it comes to whitening. i have a horrible memory so i thought maybe since i have to brush my teeth anyways this will help even though I was never a big fan of brushing my teeth.After about a week my mouth started feeling cleaner after i used it and and i started noticing they were brighter! It leaves a glossy shine on your teeth and feels great when i brush them, now i WANT to brush my teeth all the time and always catch myself smiling in the mirror for a minute or two after I'm done!!!
At first, I wasn't too sure how great the toothpaste was going to work but after using the toothpaste (along with the 3D Whitening Mouthwash) for about 2 weeks I've noticed a signifant diffence in the color of my teeth. It even removes stubbor coffee stains off your teeth! I would highly recommend this product to ALL of my friends and family! This toothpaste is worth every penny!!
I used to smoke cigarettes and drink a LOT of coffee and (even though it's bad) brushed my teeth only once a day. I used the Crest 3D White toothpaste and got an unbelievable amount of compliments on how white my teeth were. I told everyone that my teeth were so white because of the Crest 3D White toothpast and they all went out and bought it and love it as much as I do. My boyfriend loves my bright smile and so do I :) I will never use any other toothpaste!
I have had my teeth whitened with trays when I had invisalign braces. Great job there but the product is expensive. $35 is a lot for a tube that will get your teeth white but not keep them white. So I added this into the mix. WOW.. what an amazing toothpaste. I love how it works and it's easy on the enamel and it's just terrific. HIGHLY recommend this. (someone 2 days ago said I had the whitest teeth.. what was I using?. I told her just this toothpaste!!)
Love how well this cleans and the fresh feeling it leaves behind. Best toothpaste EVER!
I have been using the Crest 3D White vivid toothpaste for about 3 weeks along with the Crest 3D whitening rinse. This is the best tooth paste that I have used. When using both products I have noticed a big difference in the way my teeth look Very white. Thanks Crest for creating such a great product.
I purchased this product and I seen no! difference in my teeth and the tube was only about half full the rest was air!! For the money this is a WASTE!!
this toothpaste is truly amazing. it not only cleans your teeth, freshens breath and helps remove stains, but the best part is it no longer makes brushing your teeth a chore. the texture of the formula is so soft and it foams in your mouth once you start to brush. it tastes great, it is not the typical 'gel' texture you find in most toothpastes, or the traditional 'pasty' sticky mess from the old days. i was using Pro-Health which was good but still had that gel texture and the flavor was a bit strong, which sometimes isnt good for sensitive teeth. does 3D offer the same benefits as pro-health or is it more focused on whitening and less on tooth and gum health?
I bought this toothpaste not looking for any results. Truthfully, I bought it because it was on sale. Well, my savings paid off because I have gotten compliments from my friends asking what I have done to whiten my teeth. I then realized it was the new toothpaste I had been using for two weeks!
I absolutly LOVE this toothpaste! It has a better flavor compared to most whitening pastes! I also found that I got results in less then 14 days. I always look forward to new crest products!!!
I love crest products but I have noticed that the caps on the large toothpastes never shut properly-even when I take the time to wipe around them I usually find the top leaking out in the drawer or on the counter top. I love the sample or smaller travel toothpastes just due to the cap difference. As a consumer I would love to see the larger tubes of toothpaste have the screw tops (like they use to)instead of the tab tops-I get tired or having to replace the tubes just due to the mess they create. Otherwise I am one of your biggest fans!Thanks for listening!
I like the taste of the product but the packaging or tube that you have it in is for the birds. Right off the bat the lid broke off and therefore when you tried to set up the toothpast it didn't fit right. I do like that it is able to stand up when the lid is on it right but with the lid broken it sometimes doesn't seal and causes the past to dry out. Please look at putting on a different lid. Thank you,
This whitening toothpaste is the best I've ever tried. I am so very pleased with the quick results. The container, however, is very faulty. Each 1 of the 3 I have purchased had the cap break off within the 3rd use.The cap just snaps off - it needs to be changed to a screw cap. I loose toothpaste as a result because there is no cover on the tube.
The 3D tooth paste is great but the tube has been a problem since we started using our first tube. The cap tore from the "hinges" almost immediately and the paste is all over the inside of the cap and the top of the tube. I think the problem is that in trying to get the cap on to protect the product from germs etc., you end up squeezing the tube trying to get the cap in place. POOR DESIGN! Bring back the screw on cap please!
I love this product and it does what it say it will do. But I dislike the cap as it always breaks off and then I have a mess to deal with. Toothpaste great product packaging awful. Please replace the packing the toothpaste is in. It's hard to push toothpaste out of the tube and every tube I've bought the cap breaks off.. Please make it easier for everyone to use.
I'm a smoker and a coffee drinker. I have used so many whitening products before, and they did the job, but the results never stayed. But this system's results have stayed! I used the 3D strips,the toothpaste and the mouth wash, and in conjunction with each other they removed 100% of my stains. My teeth used to have a slight yellow twinge to them, but now they are pearly white and have stayed that way for months. I continue to use the toothpaste and mouth wash daily. I am in love, thank you crest for finally giving us a product that works!
I started using Crest 3D Vivid this summer (2010) and just had my 6 month dental checkup. The dental hygeniest commented that I had way fewer stains than usual and asked me what I had been doing differently. I told her that I still use my battery-operated toothbrush but that I switched toohpastes to Crest 3D so I have to say that the Crest has really made a difference!THANK YOU! I wil start trying the other products in the Crest 3D line! I tried a sample of the floss and love it already too.
The product was not much better than others at whitening. I noticed only slight improvement in four weeks. Then the bottom blew out of the tube, leaking paste out onto the sink.Not impressed.
I have always been very shy about smileing never showing my teeth. I grew up in the country and have the brown staining that well water can leave behind. My friend told me about this tooth paste and I have now used it for about 3 weeks and the results are amazing and I now can smile in pictures with my daughter and not hold back my joy for fear of showing my teeth. Thank You crest for giving me joy back in smiling.... : [)
I have been using Crest 3D Advance and have been happy with the results. My teeth are brighter but I recently tried the Crest 3D white Vivid. I love it!!! It makes my mouth and teeth feel so good! I'm enjoying brushing; therefore, I brush longer! Love it! I'm hooked! I've found my toothpaste!
I have used your products all my life.Just started using the 3-D white great product but the cap on this design keeps breaking off. Would be better in the normal packaging container you use for Crest Whitening with scope. Just though you would like to know.
I have been a smoker for 25 years. I am also a smoker who is not particularly fond of dentists, so I am not always as good at going as I should be. A few weeks ago my husband commented on the terrible stains on my teeth. I had noticed it already, but was kinda hoping it wasnt that obvious. It was. It was, in fact, downright awful. I decided to give the 3d tooth paste a try. It worked beyond any idea I had. After only 1 week of using it 2 or 3 times a day, my teeth are whiter than they have been in decades.I do wish I had a before and after picture to add to this, but as I don't, people will just have to take my word for it. Crest hit a grand slam with this product.
Finally, a product that does what it states it will do at a very reasonable cost. I am a coffee and tea drinker. I noticed results from the 3D toothpaste after a couple of days of use. As time went by, my results got better! To further enhance my results I added Crest 3D White Rinse to my routine. My teeth are now significantly whiter! My teeth no longer looked stained and discolored, so I am smiling a lot more.
I have been using the Crest 3D Whitening toothpaste this whole year and I am a very heavy coffee drinker. My teeth are as white as they could be. I am so happy to have found this toothpaste. I would never change or settle for anything less. I tell my friends to use it too.
After I got my braces off, I really wanted to get my teeth whitened, but I couldn't afford it. I always keep a toothbrush and tooth paste stashed at my desk at work. I tried this product a couple of weeks ago and noticed a difference immediately. I am now using it at home and in conjunction with the whitening mouthwash. I am very please with the results. My teeth are a definitely whiter! And I didn't have to go through the expense of a professional cleaning and whitening. I've already recommended it someone else getting their braces off. I've never commented on a consumer product before. Thank you Crest.
I have used 1 1/2 tubes of this toothpaste and have noted no difference at all. I have never smoked, don't drink (including any wine). Any reasons as to why this wouldn't work for me?
My 8 year old was getting teased at school due to the color of her teeth. Despite seeing the dentist on a regular basis we were told they were normal. My husband purchased this new toothpaste and within a few days we noticed a remarkable difference and no more teasing. Thanks for a great product.
This is the best toothpaste and really whitens the teeth, but I really hate the tube it comes in. The top breaks and it is really hard to get the toothpaste out when the tube starts to get empty. I really am annoyed by this ,don't mind paying a premium over other products as this really works, but please fix the tube.
This is an oustanding toothpaste. In five days I saw a magnificent difference. If you want white teeth this will do the trick. It doesn't even cost much. I would recommend this to anybody.
I wanted to attempt to make my teeth whiter without spending too much money. I looked around, read reviews, and tried to find the best product. I came across the Crest Vivid Whitening Toothpaste, and, I have to admit, I wasn't completely sure if it would work. But, against my better judgment, I got it anyways, along with the Oral-B Pulsar Toothbrush. I've noticed a MAJOR improvement, and love the way my teeth feel! I don't know how well it works separately, but the combo is a must! My teeth have become both cleaner and whiter. Plus the minty flavor isn't bad, either! If you’re debating whether or not to get it, just go against your better judgment! :)
Crest 3D white is the best toothpaste I have ever used. My teeth has never been so white!!
My husband and I bought this three weeks ago as we have two weddings in August.We even switched our brand.After using it did leave us with minty fresh breath and our teeth felt smooth and polished, HOWEVER the main reason of Whitening/appearing cleaner Failed!!!We have been using for 3 weeks and have not seen any results.It was a disappointment and we will go back to using our normal toothpaste.
I recently tried the Vivid Toothpaste and am shocked at the results. Not only did I see a major difference in the color of my teeth, but it left my teeth feeling exceptionally clean! I should have known Crest would create such an awesome product and I will definitely continue to be a Crest loyal user.
I have been using Crest since I was a kid. I recently bought the 3D white and it is wonderful! It leaves my mouth feeling zippy and my teeth super clean. Never before have I told friends about a toothpaste, I have been telling everyone about this. You must try it!
My sister-in-law recommended this so I bought this about 2 weeks ago & I HAVE to say that it DEFINATELY WORKS!!! I've tried many different products with no results...but with the Crest 3D Vivid Toothpaste, I saw results in as little as 3 days! I couldn't believe it! It leaves a fresh taste and smooth teeth! I also use the Crest 3D White Multi-Care Whitening Rinse which is even better! I love it! I highly recommend that you try it for yourself, you won't be disappointed!
My friend recommended this product to me. I really thank her for that.
I hate the new mint gel. It's now the only option. I've been using Crest toothpaste for a very long time and loved the taste and texture of the white paste. The mint is too strong and drys out leaving dried clumps on the tip of the tube. Please bring back the white paste as an option for your loyal customers. Thanks.
I usually brush with Crest ProHealth, and decided to try the 3D White Toothpaste, and I am disappointed. I've been brushing with this product for over 5 weeks now, and I have not seen any improvement, and I brush my teeth usually two to three times a day. Sure it leaves my mouth feeling minty but it also leaves the surface stains.
I like the toothpaste, however, the flip lid on my tube broke off on the third use.
i just purchased it and used it! it works so great! it left my mouth feeling clean and my teeth feeling polished, and i noticed instant results with the color of my teeth! you should deffinently try this product! :)
I AM 56 YEARS OLD AND HAVE VERY BAD TEETH. THEY ALWAYS HAVE A YELLOWY TINGE TO THEM. ON A WHIM I DECIDED TO TRY YOUR MOUTHWASH. IT CERTAINLY COULDN'T HURT. THE CREST 3D RINSE IS A REMARKABLE PRODUCT. MY TEETH MUST BE AT LEAST 4 SHADES WHITER AND FOR ME THAT IS A MAJOR PLUS. BUY THESE PRODUCTS AND YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!
I saw this product on a commercial and was instantly intrigued. After coming to this site and reading other reviews I decided to give it a shot. Being a smoker I was a bit skeptical, but after the first use there was a noticable difference! Ive been using this product for 3 days and would be satisfied if the progress my teeth have made was as far as it went, but I still have 11 days to go to see the full results and I am highly anticipating the outcome! I have tried other whitening products and have never seen such results, I recommend this product to anyone who wants whiter teeth, thank you Crest for providing such a remarkable product!
Okay so I just tried this about two days ago, and not only does it make my teeth feel extremely clean and smooth, but I have already seen a difference in my teeth color.My teeth feel so glossy & clean, all day long!!! I wish I would have tried this sooner! I have told everyone I know about this product and I will be sticking with this toothpaste for as long as they keep making it!! =)I look forward to brushing my teeth now! lol
I am a pretty heavy tea and coffee drinker with braces.. and sensitive teeth. I've been on a mission to find a product that whitens my teeth without interfering with my braces. I decided to give the new Crest 3D toothpaste and mouthwash a try. So far, I've been using them for about 4 weeks now and I have definitely noticed a considerable difference in the whiteness of my teeth!! This product does exactly what it states, whitens and removes surface stains without the increased sensitivity that you normally get from whitening products. I recommend this product to everyone I know!
Love it.....makes me want to brush all day. Leaves you with a minty taste all day. Teeth feel very fresh and smooth after brushing that stays for long periods. No sensitivity like other whitening toothpastes. I would highly recomment. Awesome product.
I have no issue with the 3D White toothpaste, however I am frustrated enough with the packaging to complain. The new style stand up lid makes getting the last amounts of product out of the tube difficult. The real irritation is 3 of the four tubes we have bought the flimsly lid attachment breaks and becomes a pain every use after.Your supplier needs to strengthen the hinge for the lid.
My husband noticed a difference after one use, I told him to clean his glasses. After a few uses I noticed the stain where my gums were receding was breaking up and looked better than the professional cleanings I get 4 times yearly. I gave a tube to my best friend in Md. without saying anything about the product except to try it. She told me she saw a difference after one try also. She had to meet a client that day for business. The next thing I know, she's calling me from her meeting to get the exact name of the toothpaste to tell her client. Yes, you can count on us to tell everyone about this product. But, it is a Crest product so what else would you expect but this excellence.
i've just been useing crest 3D vivid white for a week a little whiter already but the clean fresh feeling and taste lasts all day very good product thanks
I have been a fan of Crest toothpaste for years, but they have outdone themselves with the new 3D toothpaste. It makes my teeth feel cleaner than any brand I've tried and the fresh taste stays with you all day! I really feel like its working well into my day!
I just tried it and it seemed to instantly make my smile whiter. I love it. My mouth feels so clean every time i brush, and people have been complimenting my smile! It has gotten so much whiter. I have only been using the tooth paste and mouthwash and it works on its own. I love it. I hope next i can get the whitening strips!!
I've been using this toothpaste for three weeks, and I don't notice a difference. In fact, the toothpaste I was using before (Colgate Total) made my mouth feel fresher, and my teeth looked whiter. I've been using both of them together because I didn't want to give up the Crest in case it would work eventually. It was very expensive, which wouldn't matter if it worked. Maybe I just got a bad tube. I'd love to receive the same results that everyone else is getting.
I have used plenty of whitening toothpastes and this is the first time that I have seen noticable changes. And not only that I noticed the changes within a few days. Would definitely reccoment product to anyone.
This is the very first time I have bought a whitening product that actually does what it says it will. My teeth are whiter and they do feel super clean!
I tried this product in January 2010. I had used Crest White Strips before and liked the results, but WOW! The toothpaste was amazing! It tasted great and the results were immediate. It's an excellent product and my teeth look better than ever before. Thank you Crest for creating such wonderful products.
I've tried several different whitening products in the past but none gave me such quick and thorough results! I liked how the products worked together to give me whiter teeth in shorter time.
This product is awesome!!! It taste great and leaves your mouth feeling clean! The rinse foams so you knows it gets in the crevices and really works!
Great tasting toothpaste that enhances the 3D whitestrips without the high cost!
It's like little foaming bubbles cleaning your teeth. I've noticed compared to other toothpastes I used that it foams more. It's almost like little bubbles cleaning your gums and in-between your teeth. I knew I wanted to try the whitening strips but after trying all three of the 3D products they really do compliment each other to get you the cleanest whitest teeth possible without going to a professional.
I use this toothpaste daily as part of my new regimen...I used the whitestrips to almost instantly whiten my teeth and follow up with the toothpaste for everyday maintenence. The toothpaste doesn't foam up as much as I'm used with other pastes, but it doesn't really matter when it works this well!
I love this toothpaste, it whitens and the taste is great - not strong like so many others.
I've tried many whitening products before & use them regularly but nothing prepared me for the results I got with 3D. Even without using the whitestrips I noticed an immediate change with just the toothpaste. The very first time I saw a difference. I've been so impressed with this product that not only do I tell everyone about it but I even offer to let them come brush their teeth with my toothpaste just to prove how good it is. This is well worth the cost & I will continue to use & rave about the results I'm getting. I hope whoever reads this will give it a try too. You won't be disappointed!!!!
It's truly amazing how quickly Crest 3D White Vivid Toothpaste removes stains - literally after just two brushings my stains were almost gone! Continued use gives the best results. Great product - I just bought three more - don't want to ever run out.
Crest 3D White Vivid Toothpaste really holds true to it's title. It's whitening power is evident very shortly after starting the use of the product. It has a fresh taste that is not overpowering and leaves my teeth feeling squeeky clean. Using it in conjunction with the new mouth rinse packs a punch in ridding my teeth of stains left from my coffee habit. Glad to know there are products out there that can do this great of job.
I used this along with the strips and they work great together!
I purchased a 4.1 oz tube of Crest Vivid White Night fluoride toothpaste in moonlight mint flavor.The cap is wide, which I liked and chose for it's ability to stand upright on the sink.What is frustrating is the plastic hinge popped immediately, causing the cap to lose the capability to screw or click back in place. The tube topples over when it should be standing and the cover doesn't stay in place, exposing and drying the end product. If making a wide cap, please consider either a better hinge system or ability to screw on and off, maintaining a level base for standing.
I tried this toothpaste and I love it! It left me with minty fresh breath all day long! It was much more then I expected!
The Crest 3D toothpaste is the best whiteing toothpaste I have ever used. I have told friends and family about what a great product it is and they have purchased it and also agree.
This new Crest 3D provided visible results within just a few days. My teeth looked brighter and felt smooth and polished. Best of all, there was no sensitivity like other products I've tried in the past. My friends noticed a difference, so I'd recommend it.
I have tried ALOT of whitening toothpastes and this one, by far, is the BEST! I noticed a difference after the very first use! It leaves my teeth feeling cleaner and whiter than any other toothpaste I have ever used! I will never use another toothpaste again!
I liked that the toothpaste is somewhere between a gel and a paste and looks kind of glittery when it comes out of the tube...it makes me feel weirdly festive while brushing my teeth. It tastes great, foams up nicely, and leaves my teeth feeling super clean.
So practically every toothpaste has whitening, but this toothpaste actually whitens!! Now, it's not something that is really noticeable, but I used this along with the 3D White Rinse, and my teeth looked brighter, I can almost feel it working every time I use it. Since you're going to be using toothpaste everyday, you should get this one, especially if you want whiter teeth, to help maintain whiter teeth every day. It definitely keeps up well with my daily cups of coffee :).
I have been using this since I got it. I love it. I would buy it again. It works wonderful my teeth feel much cleaner after using it. And the taste isnt horrible. My teeth are much whiter since using it also.
Fresh taste that leaves my teeth feeling squeaky clean.
You will see an immediate difference the first time you try Crest's 3D whitening tooth paste! With this product you don't have to spend 2-3 weeks trying it before you see a difference. You will quite literally notice a dramatically whiter smile after just one brushing, which is just what the advertising will tell you (imagine that, the first product that does what it advertises!) It's about time a truely great product hits the market! I loved Crest's 3D whitening paste </3
This toothpaste works great. At first I kind of thought the taste was a little funky because it reminded me of black licorice, but after I got used to it, it really didn't bother me. and the whitening really works. I can't believe the improvement in my smile! Also, my husband has always been embarrassed by his smile (he was a previous smoker) but this toothpaste did an excellent job of whitening his smile. We have been using it for about a month now and couldn't be happier.
While this product helps with teeth whitening, it also left me with fresh breath all morning long.
I have really enjoyed my 3D toothpaste. I noticed results almost immediately. It has a great taste, and is comparable in price to the other toothpastes I have tried. I would definitely recommend this product!!!
Well I have been using the toothpaste and I saw results in 3 days and it keeps getting better. The taste is good and doesn't leave an aftertaste. Really like the texture. So far so good. Started using in on January 31st so I will keep you updated and then final result.Thank youMichele
I have always been a fan of the Crest Vivid White toothpaste. It has always been such a great toothpaste for me. And this one is no different. I am happy with the result I have gotten from using the toothpaste, and have had people compliment me on how white me smile is (which is always nice). I will continue to purchase this product from now on.
I love the Pro-Health toothpaste. Great product/ But I hate the big fat tube. It is so hard to get the toothpaste out of the tube with that hard plastic opening and the lid attached . Please go back to the normal screw off cap and forget all that hard plastic at the top.
I am on my 4th tube, I absolutely love this toothpaste & really feel like it is working & freshening my breath. I have only had 1 lid crack in my 4 tubes so I guess I've been lucky. If I could afford it I would by cases of this stuff. I even feel like I wake up with fresh breath after brushing the night before. Thank you!
This review is coming from a long time colgate user. I bought the crest because of sensitive teeth and gum issues, so I figured it couldn't hurt.All in all, the toothpaste inside the tube is good.However, the tube I bought seems to be filled more with air than with product. I realize they are sold by weight, but this tube seemed 1/2 full after the first use forced out the air.
I found it too runny and lose some product each time. Don't like the cap. It was expensive.
For my whole life I have been pleased with Crest toothpaste and products.When you come out with a new product, I am excited to try them and experience new and better results. Your Pro-Health Gum Protection is great.! I have seen improvments in the health of my teeth and gums. BUT! THERE IS A MAJOR FLAW IN THE LID DESIGN. The second time I opened the lid it cracked at the hinge area, and made a mess there after. I COULD NOT WAIT TO FINISH THE TUBE, AND THROW IT AWAY. I will not be purchasing any more toothpaste with this faulty lid design. Please continue with the great products.thanks, Char
I have been using Crest since it first came to market when I was a kid, and I still really like the toothpaste, but the current cap is just terrible. I just finished cleaning out a gob of toothpaste that leaked out of the tube into my bathroom drawer onto all sorts of other objects. Please bring back the old screw top!
I bought this toothpaste because I love Crest products. I like the strength of the toothpaste, I like the way it freshens my breath....but I hate the mess that comes with it. If you by chance forget to snap the lid, it will just run right out of the container. You will come in to find a puddle of toothpaste just lying on your counter. I have never had a problem with any other product...but this one was not something I would purchase again.
I love that this has a wintergreen flavor (even though it's called something else). My complaint is the packaging cap. It always seems to break off at the hinges, and with this paste being runnier, it oozes out if you aren't careful with the cap.
First the container for the toothpaste is packaged poorly. The cap is overly large and it is hard to squeeze out the last of the paste. Excessive use of plastic, keep it simple.The paste itself does no more or no less than regular crest. Extremely disappointed.
I am a current dental hygiene student with a fiance who hates the dentist. It had been a constant struggle each night for 6 years as he refused to brush his teeth before bed! But recently the crest rep came to our school and gave us samples. I have brought home MANY samples but once my fiance got a hold of this one.... I swear to it the other night he was brushing his teeth before bed with out my asking!! He loves the flavor and how minty it is. I also love the flavor. Previously I stuck to my favorite toothpaste from another brand but this one is great :) ( so is the Night time one I've used it as well)
Difficult to use product due to semi-liquid consistency . Tube cap retainer straps popped off on initial effort to open tube. Disappointed with experience with this product. It may be effective, but if it won't stay on the brush and is not user-friendly, it is of no use to me.
This product has great potential, you need to work on the the texture of the product, it is runny and runs off the tooth brush. I love the way it makes myteeth feel when I am done brushing, but again the tooth paste is too runny.
This is the best toothpaste I have ever tried. My teeth have never felt or looked so clean!! I am absolutely hooked, and I signed up just so that I could write this review and tell people how awesome it is! I saw that another review said they had trouble getting it to stay on the toothbrush, just want to say that I have had no such trouble.
i love this product i works so good and i would recoment this to anyone. as a receptionest in an office i like to have white teeth and this product not only gives me this but it also keeps my breth fresh.
I have tried dozens of toothpastes. To fight plaque, whitening, gingivitis etc. and bought separate tubes of each but never felt the all around "clean feeling".After only two days with this toothpaste my teeth feel really "clean" - will definitely buy again because it works and has everything I need in one toothpaste - finally!Great product!
I love love love this stuff. It's hard to get sometimes because it's always sold out. So my solution is to buy 4 boxes at a time when I see it. It really is that good! Keep making this great product.I love love love this stuff. It's hard to get sometimes because it's always sold out. So my solution is to buy 4 boxes at a time when I see it. It really is that good!

Finally, after years of waiting, you have created a toothpaste that my family loves. The freshness last for hours after brushing. I am stocking up just in case you decide to pull yet another flavor we like off the shelves. Hope Not, but just in case. Keep this flavor around for a while please. We love it !!!!!(hide full review)Finally, after years of waiting, you have created a toothpaste that my family loves. The freshness last for hours after brushing.

I must say I do not know how I ended up with this toothpaste. I usually go for the cheapest name brand but have mostly used AquaFresh. However, I did notice with this toothpaste that my teeth felt cleaner and had that fresh feel longer. So, when my son told me we were almost out I went to see what it was since we both commented on how much we liked it. I must say that I have now become a toothpaste snob and will only be buying this product.

I usually used to be completely dedicated to Colgate, but recently I have been using Crest products like Crest Sensitivity and Crest Pro-Health. I have been very happy with the results, but nothing really stood out to me. UNTIL, my boyfriend brushed his teeth at my house and left his toothpaste on the counter. It was Crest Plus Scope Outlast. So I thought, "hmmmmm, I'll at least try it". It is by far the best tasting and freshest toothpaste I've ever used! I don't want to give it back, and will fight if he tries to take it. I have never used a toothpaste that made my mouth feel so wonderful!

I've grown up with Crest toothpaste and contribute beautiful, healthy teeth (even at 48, only 4 cavities, and Mother of 2) partly to Crest products. Never before have I felt compelled to write a review about a product, but Crest Extra White Plus Scope Outlast is the best toothpaste! My teeth feel so clean -- like they do after a professional cleaning. So glad I'm been a faithful Crest user and so glad you developed this toothpaste!

I love this toothpaste. I have used other whitening toothpaste, and I have never been able to tell that they made a difference in the look of my teeth. I have been using this product about three weeks, and my teeth are visibly whiter. Also, I can still tell I've brushed my teeth an hour later. Great product.(hide full review)I love this toothpaste.

This is the best toothpaste I have ever used. I have acid reflux which gives me a bad taste in my mouth and all the toothpastes I have used in the past stop working within 15 minutes. This product really does last 5 times longer and my mouth feels fresher much longer. It is strong, but I love the clean peppermint flavor!!(hide full review)This is the best toothpaste I have ever used.

I have gone through many types of toothpaste over the years....This is by far the best. Its claim to keeping your mouth fresher longer is very true. It even prevents me from snacking because I want to keep this feeling for as long as I can.Please do not discontinue this toothpaste..IT IS THE BEST.(hide full review)I have gone through many types of toothpaste over the years....This is by far the best.

I grew up using Crest toothpaste exclusively and have continued using it as an adult. Recently our dentist gave me a sample of Crest Extra White Plus Scope Outlast Toothpaste-Long lasting mint and I loved it. My mouth felt so clean and that feeling lasted and lasted. I purchased a larger tube for my husband and I to both use, but when that ran out I grabbed a tube of regular Crest toothpaste. My husband wouldn't go back to using the regular Crest and I found him squeezing the old tube of Outlast so he could get whatever small amount was left.

My husband wouldn't go back to using the regular Crest and I found him squeezing the old tube of Outlast so he could get whatever small amount was left. We both think the Crest Extra White Plus Scope Outlast Toothpaste is the best!
I absolutely love this toothpaste! It does what it says and lasts for hours after brushing. My mouth feels so fresh and clean for a very long time after brushing.I absolutely love this toothpaste!

After seeing commercials and hearing radio personalities talk about this paste, I decided to buy it. I will admit that I did not believe the marketing hype at first, but when I finally used it I was very pleased. My mouth feels fresh a lot longer than when I used ordinary toothpaste. :)I am very pleased!(hide full review)After seeing commercials and hearing radio personalities talk about this paste, I decided to buy it.

I am absolutely in love with the fresh clean feeling I get from using Crest Outlasting toothpaste. It is divine! I leave early early in the morning to teach a class before going to work. And after teaching my class for an hour and then coming into work, my mouth still feels freshly cleansed. I’ve noticed that because my mouth does still feel clean, I am able to push off my potential habit of snacking. I snack to not only curb my hunger but to cleanse the palate sometimes. But sincerely, I don’t feel compelled to snack between breakfast (at 5:30 in the morning) until Lunch time.

I demand a minty fresh breath everyday. This is the only toothpaste I have ever used that has kept my breath really minty fresh for hours later.I demand a minty fresh breath everyday. This is the only toothpaste I have ever used that has kept my breath really minty fresh for hours later.
My husband brought this toothpaste home when I asked him to run to the store. I was always very loyal to the Crest Extra Whitening that I didn't want to try anything else. I'm go glad we did! This is amazing toothpaste - our mouths feel very clean and stay minty fresh for a really long time! We don't normally use mouthwash because they are often tooo strong - but this combination of toothpaste with Scope is amazing.

1st toothpaste I've ever used that exceeded my expectations.Most brands that I use including Crest last for up to 1 hour,after using Crest w/outlast, I can happily say , that my mouth remainedvery fresh for close to 3 hours.1st toothpaste I've ever used that exceeded my expectations.Most brands that I use including Crest last for up to 1 hour,after using Crest w/outlast, I can happily say , that my mouth remainedvery fresh for close to 3 hours.
I have long used nothing but Crest toothpaste. Its a good product, but the taste is bo-o-o-oring. I also use Scope mouthwash. I love the taste. When Crest first came out with a toothpaste that contained Scope, so much the better. THEN they came out with Extra White Scope Outlast. Wow. It REALLY wakes me up in the morning! Congratulations on finally creating the perfect toothpaste.(hide full review)I have long used nothing but Crest toothpaste. Its a good product, but the taste is bo-o-o-oring.

I have waited years & years for a decent toothpaste to be developed again and Crest Outlast is it! First and foremost I love that t is not a goopy "kids" type toothpaste. 2nd that it does not have a funky flip top that breaks off 3/4 of the way through the tube. Last but not least, I love that it truly is "long lasting mint". My teeth and breath feel cleaner and fresher much longer. I love this stuff!Now that I have found something I really like, please do not discontinue it! In my opinion you have come up with the perfect toothpaste! Good job!Sincerley,ms(hide full review)I have waited years & years for a decent toothpaste to be developed again and Crest Outlast is it!

I actually grabbed the Crest Extra Whitening Outlast with Scope thinking it was my usual brand of Crest toothpaste...The first time I used it, it was immediately refreshing, but I didn't realize until I was eating my breakfast, how long lasting it really is! My mouth was actually still minty even after eating cereal with milk...I just couldn't believe it! The best toothpaste ever!

I tried this product and it really does leave you feeling fresh longer. I brushed with it and then took a drink of water later and it refreshed the feeling. It is really cool. Friends dont believe me when I say it really is different but a couple who have tried it are now converts. Really a cool product.(hide full review)I tried this product and it really does leave you feeling fresh longer. I brushed with it and then took a drink of water later and it refreshed the feeling.

Disappointed with this toothpaste it is too sweet plus the cap makes a mess over the counter top. I won't buy it again.
I am very disappointed in the cap design on this product. The tooth paste leaks out on my counter top and in my drawers. Very messy and I would not purchase again until the problem of leaking has been resolved.
You really do get that "after the dentist" clean feel, but without the gritty after taste. I get a slight tingly feel around my gum line while brushing, and after, that tells me it's working, but it's nothing like the extreme sensation you get from brands like Listerine. I love this stuff, and I'm switching toothpastes to it!
This was the first time that I have bought a Crest toothpaste, and after only a week of using it, it will certainly be my last. I purchased this product due to its price and because I had a coupon, but have come to realize that it was a waste of money and energy. After using it for a week, the cap is completely gummed up and won't hardly close. Every attempt to clean it has led to a clean cap that just gets gummed up again. I was also highly disappointed with the product packaging. I was looking for a tooth PASTE when I bought this. "Clean Mint" doesn't provide enough information for me to know that it was actually a gel that I was purchasing.
I've used Crest for as long as I can remember, and I'm 60 plus years old, and I'm satisfied with the product inside the packaging. But the packaging leaves a lot to be desired. I've never written a product review, but the flip-top cap is so worthless I felt a need to write a review. But when I went to your web site I could not believe how many people are complaining about the same thing. The cap is messy, a nusance to use, and wastes enough plastic to make 4 or 5 twist of caps. And it ends up in the landfill for eternity. I don't even use the flip top feature, I unscrew the cap and screw it back on like I have for years.How many people have to complain about this before Crest reacts?
Crest Pro-health toothpaste is a must buy for our family. However, the flip top lid will not close after just a few uses so approximately 2/3 of the 7.8 oz. tube is wasted. This type of ineffective lid makes the cost of the product prohibitive.
This is the first time I have ever written a product review. I would never recommend this product or buy it again.The tube leaks and oozes and is virtually impossible to cap once you start using it. The tube and cap combination, coupled with this particular gel, appear to be the worst idea in the history of toothpaste. Why Crest doesn't change this is a mystery. We are going back to Sensodyne products until Crest figures out how to deliver this product in a better package.
I have used Crest products for as long as I can remember. With age and what my dentist calls “overly rambunctious” brushing I needed to switch to a sensitive style of tooth paste. Having always been happy with Crest products I tried Crest Sensitive Shield, Smooth Mint. I am less that enamored with this product. I could deal with the horrible taste, but my mouth/teeth do not feel clean, much less fresh after use. Product packaging is an engineering miss. To close the cumbersome snap on cap you need to hold the tube fairly firmly which dispenses product to the underside of the cap, creating a constant mess. I’m sorry but Sensitive Shield Smooth Mint is a huge miss in my book.
The tooth paste is excellent.The tube and cap leave more than something to be desired. The cap closes poorlyand broke off completely on 2 of 4 tubes and partially on the third. This is supposed to be a premium product. At least it has a premium price. A better delivery system needs to be used if my ongoing business is to be expected. Toothpaste all over the vanity top with continual leaking everywhere. It seems to me that your target market is older and more affluent users some of which are arthritic. I still have excellent dexterity and found closing the tube a challenge. All that plastic everywhere but where it is needed. The cap is Rube Goldberg and the designer should be fired.
The product seems pretty fair overall but there are a few "glitches" such as it leaves your teeth dry and doesn't remove surface stain from coffee, mouthwash....ect. The design of the bottle is poor and the cap will only stay shut if you whack it on the counter. However the toothpaste leaks through the cap which leaves a huge mess every morning on my counter. The mess is like grease that doesn't come off and stains. I would recommend this product if they fix the "glitches"
I've used Crest for the past 48 years, but will throw away my present tube and never buy more. Problem 1 is the stuff has the consistency of gun grease. It sticks to and gloms up everything it touches. Problem 2 is the lid on the tube. Instead of a simple screw-on lid, it has a complicated, bump and hump-ridden hinged contraption. Gun grease oozes out every time the lid is closed, and must be wiped off to prevent getting on things. But the wipeoff is difficult because the outside of the contraption is almost as bump and hump-ridden as the inside.
I purchased Crest pro-health for the first time and wasn't sure if would be up to my expectations but using it in a daily basis I actually seen improvements in my teeth and gums. I want to let you know I even though the product was a bit higher in price then I can afford. I was happy with the ending results.
I am a huge fan of Crest toothpaste...especially the Pro-Health. There has got to be something wrong with this last batch we bought. The Clean Mint is a mess!! As soon as you open it, it runs all out of the tube. Every night when I come back to use it , it has pooled out all over the bathroom counter!! Not enough thickener?? Not sure what happened here...will never buy this kind again.
The tube feels flimsy and the cap is a waste of plastic. I like the flavor but beyond that I have my doubts. The package makes a lot of claims such as fights cavities, gingivitis, plaque, whitening, sensitivity, and bad breath. When I browsed this web site to see just how this was accomplished all I could find was a product description that listed fluoride and a whitening agent. Regular Crest has fluoride so what makes this product any better. I can't justify the price on the evidence provided. It does taste good though.Secondly the hoops you have to jump through to even leave a review makes me wonder if crest is trying to discourage people from leaving feedback in the first place.
I never register to give comments but this product is worth it. However, the packaging could be a deal breaker. Toothpaste runs & leaks all over the place. Cap doesn't stay closed. Right now I have it upright in a cup..that's the only way I can keep it relatively clean.
Crest Toothpast-terrific, but product packaging is the worst. Replacing a simple screw-off top, with a snap-back top creates an unworkable result.After a few uses, the top does not snap back on-this results in the toothpaste (a liquid) to ooze out of the container creating a huge mess and waste of product. This happens after using 1/10th of the product, it is a horrible mess, and just easier to throw out. Your product packaging design process failed here: a flawed design, and failure to test it before releasing it to the market.
My problem with the Crest Pro Health toothpaste is in the dispenser itself. For the past three tubes I have purchased, they have ALL had the hinge break on the flip top and when standing up, it oozes the toothpaste out - very frustrating and messy. Perhaps your R&D can come up with a better dispenser. Otherwise, I have used Crest since my early childhood and love the mint gel. Thank you for your consideration of this review.
When I got braces, I decided I needed to start using a non whitening toothpaste, so I chose this one. The next appointment I had at the orthodontist, was in june, and I went in, and one of the first things the orthodontist said was, "wow. Your gums look so healthy! So pink!" and then he went on about braces and healthy gums and how he was really impressed with my oral health. Now my braces are off, but last week I went to the dentist, and she said the exact same thing, and how she loved when patients who came in had healthy gums. I would definately recommend this toothpaste for ANYONE! Especially people who need to improve on their oral health!
This is without a doubt, the best toothpaste that I have ever used in my life! I'm 49, and may have some form of gingivitis (which this toothpaste fights) I've been using this product for about 6 weeks, and my mouth has never felt cleaner. So many other toothpaste have always seemed like their interacting badly in my mouth leaving my breath in question. And believe me, I do the flossing, tongue scraping, mouthwash, but this is the first time in awhile that I feel good about my breath. (even after eating) This is by far your best product to date, so please continue making it . Change the cap if you want to, but please keep the clean mint gel formula the same.Thanks
Like many other reviews, I was very disappointed with the cap on this product. There is easily at least ten brushings worth of toothpaste that is not easy to get to because of the design of the lid. It is cumbersome and bulky at best, will not be buying this toothpaste ever again, and hoping other Crest products do not have the same lid, or I will not purchase those anymore either. Hello Colgate!
The toothpaste may work and the flavor is good...BUT most of it is leaking out of the cap. The flip cap is difficult to close and the toothpaste is "loose", so it makes a terrible mess. The consistency of the toothpaste would not be a problem if the cap worked, but since it doesn't I end up with a mess on my hands everytime I pick up the tube and a mess on the counter. It is very frustraterating!!!! Also this is not an inexpensive product, so the fact that a lot of the toothpaste ends up wasted only makes it all worse.
I like Terri had the bad cap. I love the taste and price but the leaky cap should be investigated. I am not a child and know how to close a cap, and if it still does not close I have the knowledge and wisdom to try and make it close. Upon it still not closing is the reason I will not buy it again and hope others who have read this will not.
Disappointed is definitely the word! The product itself performs up to P&G standards, however the packaging does not work. I was really disappointed in the cap closure for Crest Pro-Health. I know how much effort goes into these packaging details, and am surprised that in consumer testing this was not an issue. I thought it would be easy for my kids to close the flip top, but it does not close without careful attention and effort. This results in toothpaste leaking out all over the counters and drawers. This is an unfriendly consumer package. I have taken the time to write this, as I know it is important to get this information so that a redesign can be discussed.
Finally! An "adult" toothpaste that doesn't make me gag. I've been using the Crest Kids toothpaste for as long as I can remember because it's the only toothpaste that didn't bother me.My friend recommended this one and it's great! I love the different texture and flavor, it's not an overpowering mint like all the other toothpaste's I've tried.I haven't had a problem with the cap yet but even if I did have problems I'd just find a work around. Have you people just tried replacing the cap with an old style cap yet?
I have used Crest for many years and will continue to do so because it is an excellent product. However, I do not recommend it at this time for one reason - the cap. After using the toothpaste a very few times, there is no way to close the tube. Packing it in a suitcase requires wrapping it in a plastic bag because the toothpaste is squeezed out.I hope that you will re-package it in a different container with a cap that will close.
I tried Pro-Health toothpaste upon the recommendation of my dentist. It had been years since I had purchased a Crest product. The toothpaste itself is not bad in regards to flavor, but it does lack the foaming action of the brand I have been using for the last 5+ years. The packaging is inferior in my opinion. The tube is too broad/ rigid at the neck. The lid is also too large. It is a serious challenge to utilize the entire product once the tube borders on empty. I am on the fence as to whether or not I will switch back to my old brand, due almost exclusively to the current tube design. I cannot stress enough the need for Crest to change to the traditional tube and lid design.
This toothpaste is by far my favorite. I have read other reviews ab the packaging and i have not experienced a problem with it at all. The toothpaste is wonderful and the taste is amazing, I would recomend to anyone that asked. I never want to stop brushing my teeth once i start. This product is amazing!
I have used Crest toothpastes for many years and have never been unhappy with the products. However this new Pro-health had a sandy grit that was really ucky. I will throw it out with the box after only one use. What a waste of money.
I was in Sam's club last month and needed toothpaste and I have been using crest cavity brand which they did not have so I bought the new PRO-HEALTH clean mint. I am so dissappointed with this product after using Crest toothpaste for most of my life. It liquifies so rapidly that I have it running down my arm before I am half finished and it has practically disappeared before I finish. I like the fact that it does so much for my dental health and the clean mint is great, but I would rather have it in a more traditional paste. It is also difficult to empty the tube when it becomes depleted so unless something is improved I probably will not buy this product .
Love the Crest Pro Health Clean Mint. I have never had the leaking problems that others describe here. My only problem is that I can no longer find the travel sizes. Anyone know if they are still available?
I think half the tube of tooth paste of Crest Pro-Health has been on my counter or inside my bathroom drawer. I've read the comment section. Tried snapping the lid shut; keeping it upright. To no avail. There's a definate flaw in the consistency. I had to finally give up and throw it away IN a plastic bag!
The Pro-Health toothpaste is great,very effective, but I join others with objections to the tube design. The snap top works poorly, leaking roothpaste all over. Also the"shoulder" of the tube is so hard, you loose a lot of the product that stays in the tube. We are instructed to flatten the tube from the bottom as it is used. It will not stay flattened ! I almost wish for the "old fashioned" metal tubes with the small screw top.
The toothpaste is fine but I am tired of cleaning out of the drawer, off the counter, etc. because the cap does not close. You need to change the lid NOW. Over 1/2 of the toothpaste has been wasted because it leaks out the cap.
This is the best toothpaste I have ever used, only after 1 week of using it, I could tell the difference. I like the texture and taste, which is like no other toothpaste I have used before. The benefits compliment the toothpaste by ensuring you are doing the best for your teeth and overall mouth health.
I am no longer using this toothpaste as the new caps do not close once they are opened. I woke up one morming to find that half the tube had leaked all over the counter. This is the second time I have complained about this and this is the last time I use Crest. After 40 years, I will be switiching brands because I cannot stand the design of the cap. Very wasteful and I would like my money back.
The toothpaste has a slightly different flavor than most of the other brands but not displeasing. I do have an issue with the new flip cap being extremely messy. With a new tube on hand, I unscrew the cap instead of using the flip feature. This keeps the toothpaste from oozing out of the flip hinge and making a mess. I would rather see the old screw cap back, much neater.
The toothpaste is great, The typeof plastic is hard to use. Each time you need toothpaste you must make sure the paste is up near the top of the tube. The plastic is soft and does not stay where you squeeze it. The paste falls to the side or off if your brush is not directly under the nozzle immediately. The cap is hard to snap into place. We are donating the other three tubes we bought to the homeless shelter. We bought the four pack of large tubes. We are buying the regular crest tooth paste as neither one of us like this packaging. We have never been dissapointed with your products before.
Works better than other toothpastes! Gives u that clean feeling and freshness. Try it! Worked for me
This is the messiest toothpaste I have ever used. The gel is more like a liquid and keeps seeping out of the toothpaste container unless the cap is put on really tight. I have two teenagers and a husband who will not take the time to put it on tight. This morning was the last straw. Even though the cap was closed, the toothpaste had leaked out during the night and caused a long line across the counter and down into the sink. So much leaks out that it is not worth the money. I threw it away.
The tube lid is way too messy, and very hard to get paste out. Guess I have to find the old fashioned tube. Your new tube won't keep the paste up at the top when we push it there. The cover is hard to keep closed.
Using my whitening strips from the same manufacturer, in combination with this 2-3 times a day, keeps my smile bright and white. It is also a wonderful mint flavor that lingers and helps you feel refreshed long after you've finished brushing.
I use this toothpaste twice a day, and literally each time I use it I see a difference after brushing for two minutes. It's pretty amazing, it's a slight difference each use, but the difference over a few days is dramatic. I love this product, and the price is also an unbeatable price. Try this product, it does exactly what it says it's supposed to!
I TOLD EVERYONE I KNOW~ ANYONE I TALK TO~ THIS PRODUCT says it whitens within a couple weeks, OMG, right away I saw the difference, as I'm a compulsive coffee drinker and have not got my teeth worked on for a year because of costs. So I read reviews on this product, ordered it, and every ounce of it is working. My teeth are whiter & cleaner than the dentists gave me, omg. iF MY CAMERA WASN'T BROKEN (at the USB) port, I'd take a photo for you, but you won't need it anyhow
I noticed a difference the first time I used this product. My mouth felt tingly and fresh for a long time after. After a week of use, I noticed a visibly whiter smile similar to how it looks after I get a cleaning at the dentist's office. I think I will stick with this toothpaste for a while.
I have sensitive teeth, so (normally) a whitening toothpaste would be painful. This toothpaste, however, did not hurt my teeth, and I noticed it actually did whiten my teeth. I have been using it for over two months, and continue to love it!
i have used this toothpaste before and it only complies with crest whitening stripsif you are buying this toothpaste just to whiten teeth pick another one...if you have yellow teeth and are a heavy smoker this toothpaste is for you.i have dim white teeth and ive been using this toothpaste for 3 weeks nowi barely saw a difference....after the first 5 days my teeth were really whitebut then it started getting dimmeri think it goes well with crest whitening strips
Good price & FAST delivery!
Okay this is the closest you are going to get to whiting your teeth at a great price! this product is the BEST Toothpaste and i can honestly state that being as i've tried almost EVERYTHING to get brighter and whiter teeth. I Will Never use anything else. It actually does what it says and not only have i noticed it but now i get compliments on my teeth all the time :D
I don't have much to say about this toothpaste. It seems like normal toothpaste.
Great toothpaste. It is about 50 cent cheaper, versus buying it out of the store. It ships to the home for free. I like to buy certain products on line to save time and money and not have the hassle of waiting in line. It will be shipped directed to your front door. Crest 3-D toothpaste has a fresh taste and it does not irritate my gums like some other toothpaste. My daughter likes it and it has a great taste and protects your teeth.
Awesome toothpaste. Ive never found any toothpaste thats better.
Hands down this is the best tooth paste I've ever bought. It whitens my teeth and keeps my mouth looking clean and fresh. My teeth stay whiter and cleaner when I use this product. I did however tried Glamorous White but the taste was too strong almost like a chemical taste and while it did whiten your teeth temporarily, it wasn't as effective because quickly my teeth would look as if I didn't wash brush them in the first place. I love enamel renewal and will only and always buy this toothpaste! Thanks Crest!
The product is okay. I've been useing it for over a month and not seen much change. The problem I have had is packaging. The cap broke the fourth time I opened the tube.
Vivid white is an okay toothpast but two tubes the cap and tube popped off and now the toothpaste is WORTHLESS!
I actually never do this review stuff, but I had to let anyone who is thinking about the product know that it is awesome. It whitens and cleans so well that many people ask me what I do to get my teeth so white...I have to laugh and tell them that I brush, with Crest Vivid 3D! This toothpaste is amazing and I will never use anything else!!!Thanks Crest!!
I would totally recommend it. I had my teeth whitened professionally through my dentist but I use this to maintain the whiteness of my teeth. It totally works considering i drink coffee which can stain your teeth. I keep one one in the office for those emergency meetings, but I usually just brush in the morning and at night like everyone else. And if you floss first, brush, and then rinse with mouthwash as a regimen, even the sun god will have to blink at the sight of your teeth. LOL.
Crest 3- D toothp[aste is the best on the market. I use the crest white strips and the Crest 3- D tooth paste and my teeth have never been this white in my life. I love Crest products and will continue to be a loyal customer!!! FB.
I just bought the 3d toothpaste and after the first time i used it i have seen major improvement . My teeth were as yellow as a banana due to all the smoking i do this is the best toothpaste I have ever used.
I have falin in love with the 3d white system. i use the 3d white advanced vivid enamel renewal toothpast along with the 3d white mouthwash, and it works fantastic! this is DEFINATLY a product worth trying! i am willing to bet that you will fall in love with it just as i did!Good Luck & Best Wishes! (:
It was slightly more expensive than my usual but totally worth it. After the first use I saw a difference in the color of my teeth (whiter). In combination with the crest prohealth mouthwash that contains flouride - which I began using the same time as this toothpaste - my teeth surprisingly still felt clean from one brushing to the next (morning to night/night to morning). I could not believe the difference. I actually like the combo of the gel and paste. I am a fan of both types so this combo does not bother me at all. Ultimately, truly whiter teeth, clean feeling in mouth all day long - regardless of what I eat. Very happy with this product and will continue to buy again and again.
I got my teeth whitened a few months ago, and it worked but I found out that my teeth are very sensitive. My dentist told me to use whitening toothpaste or whitestrips every so often to keep the results. However, I was concerned that my teeth were too sensitive for whitening toothpaste so I didn't use it for a few months. My teeth slowly got more stained and were returning to an unpleasant shade of yellow. I grabbed this toothpaste because it whitened and renewed enamel and I wasn't sure that it would work. But after using it for ONE WEEK, my teeth are basically as white as they were right after I got them bleached!
I think the tube for this type toothpaste should be made better, right now it is very difficult toget the toothpaste all the way down as it gets empty, for someone my age. The cap is to large, make a smaller one. Get rid of the inner plactic tube, so that it would make it better to squeeze the toothpaste down.
I am using this toothpaste presently and offer the following observations.(1) The gel-like consistency turns me off. A paste seems more substantial.(2) The residue clots on the toothbrush to form a hard shell that has to be scraped off the handle and head of the brush. I am concerned that this does not contribute to plaque in my gum line.(3)I haven't noticed any improvement in the whiteness of my teeth.
I was skeptical as we all are about any new product, especialy with a pricey tag "Just to see" if it works. I was very impressed from the very 1st use. I have used it continually for the last 4 months and have also noted a marked improvement on my tartar build up as well. I have recommended this product to many of my friends and family.
I was looking for a tooth whitening product, but something that wouldn't break the bank. I ran into this product and I was unsure if I should buy it. Fortunately, I was out of toothpaste and I decided to take my chances. I am extremely happy that I did. My teeth have whitened significantly in the past few months, and a stain that has been on one of my incisors has been growing lighter and lighter. Using a spinbrush is a good idea with this product. Actively brushing (not just holding it on top of your teeth) will likely yield optimal results for you. It did for me and I will continue to purchase this product!
I have been using this product for some time now and I love it. It taste great, leaves my mouth very fresh and has whitened my teeth. There has been no sensitivity in my teeth from use either. I am very impressed and will buy again.
This product is so good. Ive used it for about 3 days and I see and feel an improvement already. Ive brused my teeth at 7:30 this morning, I ate breakfast, lunch and a snack and my mouth still feels like I brushed this morning. It is very good and would recommend it to anybody looking for a better toothpaste
I bought both the toothpaste and mouthwash and I really like these products. My teeth seemed whiter in a week.
I'm loveing the mint flavor, It really wakes you up, it kills bad breath, & also turn your Teeth somewhat white I had the rinse to go with this product so they both work well togerther! I RECOMMEND this!
My reason for using this product was for stained teeth and the want of having whiter teeth. I noticed the change in my teeth in about 4 days. The first week my teeth was whiter then i can remember. I also use this product with the rinse. I would brush three times a day and rinse twice (morning/night). Only con I have to say about this product if you stop using this for a bit 1 or 2 days the effect will lessing but still be whiter then before. Again i use this product as a combo. with the rinse.
Crest 3D is the toothpaste to use if you want to keep the whitest smile. I have used this product for over a year and I will not change it for anything.
I used 2 tubes of this with no visible results.
The toothpaste is a great toothpaste but not exactly the best teeth whitener. It worked for maybe a week and then stopped after that. I would say that just don't expect anything spectacular.
I have been using this product for 3 weeks and can notice whiter teeth. It has good flavor, and makes my teeth feel clean
I would totally recommend this product to anyone on the streets, web, or anywhere! I brushed one time and I can already tell a BIG DIFFERENCE!
I've been using this toothpaste for at least 2 weeks now and still using it. It has gotten everything off my teeth especially in the nooks and crannies. I am so happy that after I brush my teeth I keep smiling to myself in the mirror. I know I am so full of myself LOL!
I love love love this stuff. It's hard to get sometimes because it's always sold out. So my solution is to buy 4 boxes at a time when I see it. It really is that good! Keep making this great product.
Finally, after years of waiting, you have created a toothpaste that my family loves. The freshness last for hours after brushing. I am stocking up just in case you decide to pull yet another flavor we like off the shelves. Hope Not, but just in case. Keep this flavor around for a while please. We love it !!!!!
I've grown up with Crest toothpaste and contribute beautiful, healthy teeth (even at 48, only 4 cavities, and Mother of 2) partly to Crest products. Never before have I felt compelled to write a review about a product, but Crest Extra White Plus Scope Outlast is the best toothpaste! My teeth feel so clean -- like they do after a professional cleaning. So glad I'm been a faithful Crest user and so glad you developed this toothpaste! Thank you!
I usually used to be completely dedicated to Colgate, but recently I have been using Crest products like Crest Sensitivity and Crest Pro-Health. I have been very happy with the results, but nothing really stood out to me. UNTIL, my boyfriend brushed his teeth at my house and left his toothpaste on the counter. It was Crest Plus Scope Outlast. So I thought, "hmmmmm, I'll at least try it". It is by far the best tasting and freshest toothpaste I've ever used! I don't want to give it back, and will fight if he tries to take it. I have never used a toothpaste that made my mouth feel so wonderful! Way to Go Crest!
I must say I do not know how I ended up with this toothpaste. I usually go for the cheapest name brand but have mostly used AquaFresh. However, I did notice with this toothpaste that my teeth felt cleaner and had that fresh feel longer. So, when my son told me we were almost out I went to see what it was since we both commented on how much we liked it. I must say that I have now become a toothpaste snob and will only be buying this product. It is like brushing your teeth and using mouthwash at the same time!
I love this toothpaste. I have used other whitening toothpaste, and I have never been able to tell that they made a difference in the look of my teeth. I have been using this product about three weeks, and my teeth are visibly whiter. Also, I can still tell I've brushed my teeth an hour later. Great product.
I have gone through many types of toothpaste over the years....This is by far the best. Its claim to keeping your mouth fresher longer is very true. It even prevents me from snacking because I want to keep this feeling for as long as I can.Please do not discontinue this toothpaste..IT IS THE BEST.
This is the best toothpaste I have ever used. I have acid reflux which gives me a bad taste in my mouth and all the toothpastes I have used in the past stop working within 15 minutes. This product really does last 5 times longer and my mouth feels fresher much longer. It is strong, but I love the clean peppermint flavor!!
I grew up using Crest toothpaste exclusively and have continued using it as an adult. Recently our dentist gave me a sample of Crest Extra White Plus Scope Outlast Toothpaste-Long lasting mint and I loved it. My mouth felt so clean and that feeling lasted and lasted. I purchased a larger tube for my husband and I to both use, but when that ran out I grabbed a tube of regular Crest toothpaste. My husband wouldn't go back to using the regular Crest and I found him squeezing the old tube of Outlast so he could get whatever small amount was left. We both think the Crest Extra White Plus Scope Outlast Toothpaste is the best!
I absolutely love this toothpaste! It does what it says and lasts for hours after brushing. My mouth feels so fresh and clean for a very long time after brushing.
I am absolutely in love with the fresh clean feeling I get from using Crest Outlasting toothpaste. It is divine! I leave early early in the morning to teach a class before going to work. And after teaching my class for an hour and then coming into work, my mouth still feels freshly cleansed. I’ve noticed that because my mouth does still feel clean, I am able to push off my potential habit of snacking. I snack to not only curb my hunger but to cleanse the palate sometimes. But sincerely, I don’t feel compelled to snack between breakfast (at 5:30 in the morning) until Lunch time. Love it!
After seeing commercials and hearing radio personalities talk about this paste, I decided to buy it. I will admit that I did not believe the marketing hype at first, but when I finally used it I was very pleased. My mouth feels fresh a lot longer than when I used ordinary toothpaste. :)I am very pleased!
I demand a minty fresh breath everyday. This is the only toothpaste I have ever used that has kept my breath really minty fresh for hours later.
My husband brought this toothpaste home when I asked him to run to the store. I was always very loyal to the Crest Extra Whitening that I didn't want to try anything else. I'm go glad we did! This is amazing toothpaste - our mouths feel very clean and stay minty fresh for a really long time! We don't normally use mouthwash because they are often tooo strong - but this combination of toothpaste with Scope is amazing. We love this toothpaste!
1st toothpaste I've ever used that exceeded my expectations.Most brands that I use including Crest last for up to 1 hour,after using Crest w/outlast, I can happily say , that my mouth remainedvery fresh for close to 3 hours.
I actually grabbed the Crest Extra Whitening Outlast with Scope thinking it was my usual brand of Crest toothpaste...The first time I used it, it was immediately refreshing, but I didn't realize until I was eating my breakfast, how long lasting it really is! My mouth was actually still minty even after eating cereal with milk...I just couldn't believe it! The best toothpaste ever! I absolutely love it!
I have long used nothing but Crest toothpaste. Its a good product, but the taste is bo-o-o-oring. I also use Scope mouthwash. I love the taste. When Crest first came out with a toothpaste that contained Scope, so much the better. THEN they came out with Extra White Scope Outlast. Wow. It REALLY wakes me up in the morning! Congratulations on finally creating the perfect toothpaste.
I have waited years & years for a decent toothpaste to be developed again and Crest Outlast is it! First and foremost I love that t is not a goopy "kids" type toothpaste. 2nd that it does not have a funky flip top that breaks off 3/4 of the way through the tube. Last but not least, I love that it truly is "long lasting mint". My teeth and breath feel cleaner and fresher much longer. I love this stuff!Now that I have found something I really like, please do not discontinue it! In my opinion you have come up with the perfect toothpaste! Good job!Sincerley,ms
I tried this product and it really does leave you feeling fresh longer. I brushed with it and then took a drink of water later and it refreshed the feeling. It is really cool. Friends dont believe me when I say it really is different but a couple who have tried it are now converts. Really a cool product.
Crest has another great product. Love the fresh taste!
I love using the Crest brand products and this toothpaste is no exception. Tried it and was highly pleased. Great minty taste. Left my teeth feeling squeaky clean!
Great scent and taste cleaned very well. My kids also loved the taste.
absolutely love this toothpaste. Leaves my teeth feeling clean and my breath smells good
Crest has made a product that I feel completely confident with! My teeth have never felt more clean after brushing, and my mouth feels refreshed for quite awhile after use.
The only complaint I have is that it left an aftertaste in my mouth. Other than that, it did the job.
loved the product made my breathe feel and smell wonderful
Great taste and does a great job cleaning my teeth.
It is good quality and a decent price... but so is more toothpaste.
This tooth paste has a great taste, and it is very economic too. After brushing your teeth it leaves your mouth with a long lasting freshness and clean sensation.
Made my mouth feel extermely fresh and clean! I love this product and highly reccomend it.
So I tried the Crest Complete thinking it was going to be no different than any other toothpaste I have tried and boy was I wrong. This toothpaste left my mouth tingling, it felt fresh and clean. I think I have found a new preferred toothpaste.
Leaves my teeth feeling so fresh and so clean, clean*sings*
I love trying new toothpastes, I'm always looking for the ONE. I tried Crest Complete and immediately LOVED it! My breath was fresh for hours and it didn't leave a funky taste in my mouth. After trying new toothpastes every couple of weeks, I have finally found the ONE! Thanks, Crest!!
I thought that this product was very gentle. I liked the taste also.
Great product, leaves your teeth feeling freshly clean.
It gives that really nice clean fresh feeling that lasts all day long! It's insane how effective this product is!
this is the only toothpaste I will ever use. I am very picky about my toothpaste and I have found the perfect one!
this toothpaste worked great and came in great flavors. My mouth felt really clean afterwards using it.
When I use Crest Complete I feel like I'm taking extra care with my oral hygiene.
I would definitely buy this again and again. My whole family gave it a try and it is our new favorite. I like the fresh feeling it leaves!
This is the best Crest toothpaste on the market. Leaves my teeth feeling clean and fresh.
I get fresh breath. I looks my teeth looking great and clean
I am a bounty buying kinda girl! thats one item name i will never give up on.they are strong and durable.they last through spills and reuseable as well.
Absolutely loved the clean feeling this left. Will definitely use again.
this was a good toothpaste. there was nothing to complain about but i just like the crest 3d white more
Did a great job cleaning however I did not care for the taste.
I used the Crest Total and like the way it works. I have sensitive teeth and this product worked well for the sensitivity. It leaves my mouth feeling clean.
It feels nice and refreshing. it also has a good taste to it.
The best made so far. This toothpaste offers all the essentials to maintain clean and healthy teeth. My entire family loves it!!!
I prefer other varieties of Crest over this new one. I don't like the texture or the flavor of the toothpaste.
I like this product and the freshness feeling you get.
We love the way it works for us. I have told several people about it.
I like this product a lot. And, so does my spouse. We quickly made the switch to this product. Try this. You won't use anything else.
It leaves my mouth feeling clean but I highly dislike the taste
An absolutely great product. Now you can brush your teeth while whitening, strengthening, and protecting them.
I feel like this toothpaste has it all. I really liked the taste and it really made my teeth feel clean all day.
This toothpaste made my mouth feel very clean and fresh, but there was no noticeable whitening. Overall great toothpaste and I definitely recommend it!
My family has used Crest for years. It's still our family favorite.
It was better than expected. Left my breath fresh!
My mouth has never felt cleaner, highly recommend this stuff!
We tried the sensitive toothpaste and it was nice. Sometimes brushing hurts, but this was really pleasant and the flavor was good too. It was nice and I'll defintly buy it again.Thank you!!!
work really well I love the flavor and the value...
My kids even love the taste of this toothpaste and it does a good job cleaning too.
I loved this toothpaste! It left my teeth feeling very clean.
The taste of this toothpaste is not too strong, but leaves my mouth feeling clean and minty fresh. Works great!
We love this toothpaste because it does a great job all in one and takes care of all the basic needs that you would want a toothpaste to do. It is long lasting and really makes your breath fresh. Highly recommended!
It made my mouth feel fresh and clean. It is a good flavor.
High quality and satisfies my expectations. I would recommend it to everybody.
I love crest products and this toothpaste was no different. Thanks for the samples!
This toothpaste made my teeth feel very clean. I will use it again.
I liked the toothpaste although I did not see my teeth get any whiter. It left my mouth and teeth feeling nice and clean.
Crest Complete did not leave my breath as minty fresh as my Crest with Scope. I definitely would not buy it over my Crest with Scopel toothpaste.
I Have Always Used Crest And The Multi Action Deep Clean Whitening Was A Plus I Would Recommend This And I Have Now Started Buying This Toothpaste
I like the way this toothpaste leaves your mouth feeling fresh and clean.
I have always loved Crest toothpaste but the Crest Complete was just ok for me. It's nothing new; was it a step-up from all of the other whitening toothpaste Crest has to offer... no.Crest Complete didn't whiten my teeth any brighter, however, Crest does has some great whitening toothpaste products, but I just don't think Complete is the one that should be advertised to whiten teeth.
I loved the taste of this toothpaste and I liked how it works on my teeth leaving it feeling really clean. This product lasts a lot longer than my normal toothpaste and my teeth are smoother for a lot longer.
This toothpaste is awesome! It does it all!!! Thank you for the sample!!
this is a really great product. I was very happy with it and would definitely buy again.
this was awsome toothpaste i love it and recommand it to all my friends
First of all, I actually like the taste and texture of this toothpaste. It is not too strong of a mint. It does a good job freshening my breath and cleaning my teeth. I would recommend this toothpaste for everyday use.
The new Crest toothpaste is a really invigorating experience for my mouth. Kept my teeth clean and breath fresh for an extended amount of time. I would definitely buy this product!
I am a big fan of all Crest Dental products and trust them to keep my teeth healthy. This one not only keeps them healthy but also whitens them. They are not too strong to taste and my mouth feels clean and refreshed everytime I have brushed
I think Crest Complete is one of the better toothpaste as far as making my mouth feel clean. I like that my mouth does feel cleaner after I use this toothpaste. Evne though the toothpaste cost a little more than some I would buy it again. I just wish that Crest Whitening Toothpaste whitened my teeth. I did not see any whitening.
I loved this toothpaste! It had a great taste and it didn't leave a film or residue feeling afterward. Very clean feeling.
I love this brand for its quality. It does a great job in cleansing your teeth as well as being a good tasting cleaner. It leaves a good finish on the teeth enamel also so is a good investment as far as toothpastes and polish. Thanks Crest for a very good product!!
I was not very pleased with this product. My mouth was not left with that clean feeling and the taste was kind of drab.
LOVE THIS PRODUCT LEAVESS ME TEETH VERY CLEAN AND MINTY LOVE ITTT
Great products, definitley going to purchase in the future
Crest has always been the toothpaste our family uses for the taste, value, and the way my mouth feels. Would recommend.
I love this toothpaste. It makes my teeth feel clean and leaves a fresh taste in my mouth. Love it!
this toothpaste works really good. you can feel your clean teeth! love it.. i have bought a few more since I have tried and will continue to purchase!
We all absolutely love using crest in my family. Makes your breathe smell clean and fresh and is used by all in my family so any age is fine, just limit the amount
i love this product! it has a great taste and it doesn't leave weird film.
i love this paste. It is refreshing and does the trick. Finally I found a great paste to use.
product was really good taste was fine, not gritty tasting, really improved my mouth in general, left my teeth feeling like i just came home from the dentist!
I think this is a great product that is reasonably priced. It produces good results without having to visit the dentist office.
Crest is my favorite toothpaste, would definitely reccomend this one.
I love this toothpaste. I actually switched from a previous brand to the brand because I loved how it worked.I love how it makes my teeth feel clean and my breath fresh. I will definitely be using this product for the foreseeable future!
Crest is the only toothpaste I use. So when a new kind of crest comes out I"m more than happy to try a sample first. I loved this it made my mouth feel so fresh!
My kid love it as well .. cleans good.. have you breath stays fresh.
Love this toothpaste.. I always use scope mouthwash and I thought it was so neat how they were combined!! Made my mouth feel so clean and my breath smelled fresh!!
Loved this product, it left my mouth feeling fresh!
My family loves this toothpaste, leaves your mouth feeling fresh and clean
My first reaction was to the taste, I loved it. Then as I brushed I noticed that it cleaned very well. I have continued to use it and am very satisfied with the results
This CREST product left my breath fresh & my teeth extra clean all day! I just love this new variety of CREST!!
I absolutely love how refreshing this toothpaste is! It definitely tops other competing brands! Great job! I will be purchasing in the future! Thank You Vocalpoint for giving me the opportunity to sample this great tasting toothpaste!
I found this toothpaste to be very good, nothing extraordinary about it, it does the job.
I don't have anything negative to say about this toothpaste, however I do prefer the Crest 3D.
When I use any crest products I feel confident i am clean when nice breath,
The product is ok and just average. I didn't always feel the cleanest after brushing. I didn't feel as if I had the freshest breath either. I personally wouldn't buy again.
love the toothpaste as well as my family it really did the job protecting uor teeth from deases even dentist was impressed
Crest is my favorite toothpaste brand! I love the product.
This makes my families breath fresh and their teeth clean. They love this toothpaste so much that I don't have to fight with them to brush their teeth.
love the taste and feel after brushing. However best if followed by mouth rinse.
I had heard from a friend how awesome Crest Complete was and I was very excited to try it myself. I was worried that I built up my expectations, however Crest amazed me. Crest Complete left my mouth feeling fresh and clean, and that is one of the most important things I look for in a toothpaste. I can say that after a few weeks of continuous use I was happy with the results. Yay for Crest Complete!
love this toothpaste it make my teeth feel clean i switched my old toothpaste for this one .
Makes my mouth feel so clean and refreshed! Highly recommend.
My new favorite toothpaste. Left me with a fresh mouth!
I tried the Crest Complete toothpaste and could not believe how clean my mouth felt after the first use. I love how great it works!
I love that this makes my teeth FEEL clean as well as actually cleaning them. It's not too strong.
Unfortunately, I've given Crest Complete several tries now, and every time, I feel that the toothpaste tastes terrible and doesn't leave my teeth feeling clean.
It Made My Mouth Feel Fresh & Clean, It Actually Feels Like It's Working As I'm Brushing My Teeth!!!
I thought this was a great product. It worked very well and I really like the Crest Brand. All of their products are good. I have already purchased more of it.
Love this toothpaste, it really left my mouth feeling clean and fresh and the flavor was super. Love it! Cantt say much about the whitening, didn't notice too much, but my teeth were definitely super clean.
My teeth feel fresh and clean! I love this toothpaste.
Good taste lots of bubbles. I didn't use enough to know about the whitening aspect but to use just as toothpaste it was great.
They very absorbent for how thin they are. More comfortable then other pads.
i love it. it works great and i would reccomend it to anyone!
I love this toothpaste. Leaves my teeth feeling so clean and fresh.
My husband and I both tried this toothpaste. We liked the Crest Complete toothpaste, but weren't too keen on the flavor. We normally use another brand, so this toothpaste tastes a bit sugary to us. Other than that, it worked well at keeping our teeth clean.
what a great product. run and buy it for sure!I just love this product.
I really like the clean it provides - I'm confident and very pleased with the results!
This is my all-time favorite! Love it !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
A really good tasting toothpaste. My mouth was clean and it felt fresh.
This is one of my favorite Crest products. Like how my teeth stay feeling for hours. Hope every one else enjoys it too.
I have been using this product since day one. I switch from the mint to cinnamon. I can testify that this product does it's job well. My one year old grandson loves the mint flavor as well; I have to hide it from him most of the time...he would brush his teeth twenty times a day if I let him. Great product!!!
Much nicer than other brands. Not so foamy. It made my teeth feel even cleaner.
Like the crest complete but can't tell the different in whiter teeth.
i love this toothpaste. it makes my teeth so white,shiny, and extremely clean. i smile now more than i ever have before because im really proud of how crest complete makes my teeth look great.
Leaves my teeth feeling so fresh and sparkling white, I love it!
Great product and our family loves crest toothpaste.
Like the way it made my mouth feel when I was done!
I really enjoyed the taste and how it cleaned my teeth. When I get done with the sampleI will get a larger tube.
I prefer crest pro health to this toothpaste. It tastes better. I have used crest for many years and this is the first time I have not liked their toothpaste.
This toothpaste leaves my mouth feeling fresh and clean. Recommend it!
Great product, I am a fan of Crest anyways. That is the only brand of product our family uses.
One the BEST toothpastes I have used in a long time! AWESOME fresh mint taste w/out being overpowering.
This was one of the first toothpastes that my whole family had liked. We will be purchasing this from here on out.
Awesome taste and effect. Left my mouth feeling awesome when other pastes don't always.
I love this toothpaste, it leaves my mouth feeling clean and fresh for a long time.
Love the long lasting clean feeling after using Crest! I also like the taste.
I love the fresh and clean feeling. Lasted almost all day. Seems like when you are brushing you can exactly feel it working. Will buy this product. Great job Crest!
It was good, but i couldn't tell a big difference between it and the regular crest i use.
I really love this product. My mouth loves it too!
I love how this toothpaste made your mouth feel so clean after using. Good for our whole family!
I just love the way it tingled in my mouth and loved the taste. It was extremely pure and smooth brushing experience and my smile felt and looked brighter. I will most certainly will recommend and purchase this product in the future. Thanks !
My mouth was fresh and clean after using this product. It had a great flavor that I enjoy for hours after use.
I really like this toothpaste and my husband says it's his new favorite. My teeth and mouth feel clean and crisp after using it.
I can always count on Crest for fresh breath and that clean feeling. Loved this product
I love this toothpaste! It is perfectly foamy and leaves your mouth feeling extremely clean. I hate when toothpaste is too strong and this is just perfect!
Crest is always a great product - will always use it.
I really liked this product and was very happy that I was able to try it.
I love how Crest Complete leaves your mouth feeling minty freshness. It makes your teeth feel so clean and leaves your mouth smelling so minty freshness for a long time. Other toothpastes that I used leaves your breathe smelling good for a short while, but this one has long lasting results. I recommend it to everyone to try it out.
The new Crest line of products work great! They clean my teeth, make my mouth feel great and smell great. They do whiten also!
This is my favorite toothpaste. it leaves my teeth feeling clean and my mouth fresh. I will definitely be buying it again and again.
The Crest clinical mouthwash has a very good fresh taste and give you that clean feeling, would purchase again.
Awesome flavor. Lasted most of the day. My teeth felt almost as good as having just been to the dentist. 0
this toothpaste not only cleaned my teeth, but, I actually did notice a slight whitening of my teeth from using daily.
When brushing with this toothpaste you can feel the clean. It foams in your mouth and gets all around. Then when you are done you feel refreshed and it does feel like a good cleaning just happened. I love it and would recommend it to anyone to try!
I love the toothpaste, my teeth feel sparkly clean, my mouth is fresh, and it lasts for a while after you have brushed. This is my favorite toothpaste.
I love the way it leaves my mouth feeling so fresh and so clean! That is the power of Crest!
I looooved the fresh clean feeling of this tooth paste! I am very picky when it comes to the taste, effectiveness and quality of my toothpastes. I most always stick to CREST! I have to say, the price doesn't exactly agree with me, but the sensation of the toothpaste while using it and especially afterwards is excellent, really making my mouth feel clean and fresh.
This toothpaste leaves a clean feeling in your mouth and has a nice taste to it. It's about the same price as everything else, so I rated the value as average.
I loved trying the Crest complete toothpaste. It was a really good toothpaste. Made my mouth feel nice and clean!!!
I would definitely buy again. It left my mouth feeling so clean and refreshed!
I love this toothpaste! My mouth felt fresh for a long time. Kinda like that "just left the dentist clean feeling" My breath stayed fresh - even after coffee. I would definitely use again. Great product! Loved it.
I was so impressed with this product, I shared it with a friend. My friend no longer use any other toothpaste brand but this one. Thanks for the opportunity.
Great fresh taste that wasnt too over powering but left my mouth feeling fresh and minty and clean!
It left my breath fresh and my mouth feeling squeaky clean all day.
I love this stuff! It completely left my mouth feeling fresh for a good while. Never thought this would ever happen. I mean you brush your teeth in the morning and then by lunch time again at work, you just dont feel that fresh minty feeling. I actually did until I had my tuna sandwich. ( my fault the freshness ended) Great stuff!! Loved it. Thank you
I loved this toothpaste! It gave me the feeling that I had just brushed my teeth with mouthwash. It left a great fresh feeling and I will definitely purchase in the future.
My husband and I love coffee and also red wine, but hate the stains it leaves on our teeth. Fortunately with Crest we don't have to worry about it as much anymore. It helps remove the stains and also provides all of the protection we need to maintain a beautiful smile.
The toothpaste left my mouth happy. My teeth felt smooth and clean. My husband enjoyed the fresh smell. After a week of using the toothpaste, I am seeing a change in tooth color. My smile is getting brighter!
This is a good product. Tastes good and helps me keep teeth healthy.
IT'S SO REFRESHING, CLEANS VERY WELL AND VERY MINTY. LOVE THE FRESH BREATH FEELING.
I thought the tooth paste had a nice, fresh, minty taste. The toothpaste was smooth and not gritty. Other than that I didn't feel that it was anything special. I do love the Oral B Clinical toothbrush. I felt that it really cleaned my teeth good and it got at the gum line.
I love the brand of toothpast in general but, I didnt feel it was any better than the other versions. The price was a little higher than normal for this brand but that might be because of where I live.
I love this toothpate! It makes my teeth feel super clean and healthy! It tastes great too!
I loved the flavor of this toothpaste, and so did my daughter :) It was very minty and fresh, and had a good texture to it
This toothpaste was okay nothing particularly special about it but nothing really bad about it.
I tried the new Crest and loved it! It left my mouth feeling clean and fresh. I loved that it made my teeth squeak..if you know what I mean...when i ran my finger across them. I have noticed significant brightening a few weeks in to use as well. I recommend this toothpaste to any one who wants a cleaner, brighter smile.
I thought it was fine I didn't really think it stuck out more than any others but I did like it.
I really don't have much preference about what kind of toothpaste I use. This didn't "wow" me, but it worked at least as well as any other. Taste is fine, no aftertaste, and no gritty texture.
I loved how clean my teeth feel and look after using this product.
I have tried a ton of toothpastes and Crest is always my favorite! It does't matter which Crest product, they are just always superior to other brands. I recently tested two other brand toothpastes and they were horrible; chalky, left me with a bad taste and didn't make my mouth feel clean. As always when I tried the new Crest Pro-Health Clinical products, it was like everything I've had from Crest before, made my mouth feel fresh, clean and healthy! Thanks Crest!
Same great product as always. My mouth felt clean and breath was fresh.
My teeth.. and whole mouth for that matter, felt GREAT after using the toothpaste and mouthwash. I absolutely love it, and my teeth are so much whiter! LOVE
I really liked the toothpaste a lot. It made my teeth feel squeaky clean and my mouth tasted good for a while. Overall the product was great, just not sure how expensive it would be. Might be just as well getting a cheaper brand than spending a lot of extra money for name brand that, to me, is about the same as the other toothpastes.
I am a firm believer in good dental hygiene as part of staying healthy and Crest is known to generate quality products. Crest complete is no exception. I like the way that Crest complete makes my teeth feel after brushing and the fact that it is available with additional benefits, such as whitening, is a bonus in my view. This product left my teeth feeling clean and my mouth feeling refreshed.
I liked the taste of crest complete. It's hard to tell if it does anything different than the other crest toothpaste I normally use.
I really liked the toothpaste.It made my teeth feel very nice. It has a pleasant taste also.
Crest Complete is great - I switched over from our other toothpaste and the whole family uses Crest Complete now.
I love the way it makes my mouth feel!! So fresh and clean, it also helped with plaque. I would definetly recomment it!
My 2 boys ages 6 & 9 use the kids "wishwash" (mouth wash) but said it always left a nasty taste. I let them try the crest brand with out the alchol in it and they said tasted like they was chewing gum :)
We love crest in our home and this product doesn't disappoint. I love how clean our mouths feel after use. How deep down a clean it feels like we are getting. This is a great product and one we will more than likely be buying again in the future.
Crest is the best oral care product on the market. Go out and get you some today. Try it you'll love it. Crest is the only way to go.
I like this toothpaste because a little goes a long ways and it really suds up in your mouth which I love in a toothpaste! Some others just are gritty and none sudsy. Left breath smelling great!
That is some amazingly wild toothpaste! I liked it. This is one I hope to keep in my bathroom cabinet ALWAYS!
Great taste, clean feeling after brushing, matches Crest quality, would recommend this toothpaste
I love the way it makes my teeth feel after I've finished flossing. They feel all fresh and cleaner. The floss just glides between my teeth.
I tried the Crest Complete toothpaste and thought it was very good. I felt that it cleaned my teeth well and that they stayed that way for longer than my regular tooothpaste.
This seemed to leave my mouth feeling cleaner longer than most other brand with a very nice taste
This the brand i have used for years and also the brand I trust! I will continue to use it.
This is my typical toothpaste. I love that it leaves my teeth feeling clean and that the feelings stays for more than 10 minutes.
I do not notice that my teeth are whiter, but it made my mouth feel clean.
love the toothpaste , leaves me feeling clean and refresh
Very nice product, Works great teeth for clean for hours. A little pricey I think.
Me and my family like to use Crest product.Great taste and result on the teeth.I recommended to my friends and relatives.
I have always used Crest.....from the paste to the gel. Love it. Always leaves my mouth feeling fresh. Never plan on leaving Crest for another toothpaste. Why leave the best!!!
I am a Colgate girl; always have been. Thought I would try the Crest Complete Deep Clean. WOW is what I say!!! 5 minutes later and I still feel the coolness of the toothpaste in my mouth. I feel like I have a fresh mouth...I love this! I would buy the Crest Complete Deep Clean. I can't believe I am even saying this. Thank you for the sample!!!Robin
I like the idea of a "complete" system all wrapped into one product. I would not say that it leaves a fresh feeling for 4 hrs...yet it does leave your teeth feeling ultra clean. And I trust this brand to put my teeth first.
I was so pleased with the way the New Crest and Oral B products cleaned and freshened my teeth. What a wonderful feeling it left in my mouth too. I was proud to smile and amazed at how well the products worked. Thanks so much for helping me keep that beautiful smile and making me feel good about myself. The flavor was awesome and I knew that it was cleaning my teeth better than any other product could.
I just loved how it left my mouth feeling! My teeth felt so clean and the taste was refreshing - not too toothpasty...you know? My daughter took my new tube for herself :-)
This product is the best. I love it. It whitens your teeth.
Really love Crest products and this one didn't disappoint. I love the way my teeth fill after brushing. I would recommend to everyone.
This product is great! It leaves your mouth feeling fresh and clean. I would recommend to anyone.
love this! always the best products leaves every thing fresh and clean my family love it
I have always been a Crest girl! Their original toothpaste is my favorite flavor, but nowadays there are so many amped up products to help fight tartar buildup and keep it anyway and also whiten teeth. So, I am very glad Crest now has flavors that taste like the original toothpaste and have these benefits. Also, unless prices are introductory for the new products, I think the value is great. It didn't cost me anymore than regular toothpaste. Thank you for a new and wonderful product!!
I have always liked crest and I wasn't sure they could get any better but they have.
I have always been and will always be a Crest Fan. Love how they always find a way of improving and making mine and my families mouth and teeth clean and healthy
As an mother who is breastfeeding a new born, dental hygiene is very important to me and this product made my mouth feel very clean all day without the yucky taste of harsher products.
My mouth felt very fresh after using this product. I also loved the taste!
Im a big fan of Crest, I haven't had a cavity in 3 years and I give that credit to Crest. I have used Crest all my life and will continue Thanks Crest
This product keeps my mouth and teeth feeling clean and fresh for hours. Using it on a daily basis has cut down on plaque build-up.
Love love this product. It is my favorite dental floss.
I loved everything about it! it left my teeth feeling super clean and it lasted a really long time!
Crest has always made great products for my family. But we thoroughly enjoy this sample so much that I have 3 tubes on a reserve and 1 in the bathroom right now. I love the clean feeling that I feel after brushing. I use this toothpaste at least 2-3 times a day and it keeps everything amazing.
I have used Colgate all my life - I like the clean feel my mouth had after using this product. I would recommend it.
fresh clean feeling all day long love their products
I love the P&G products and crest go along with all of them, great value for the product.
I loved the Crest Prohealth toothpaste. It tastes great and makes my teeth clean.
I liked the taste and I liked how fresh my mouth felt.
This toothepaste was fresh, left my breath feeling fresh, and clean and lasted a long time. I didn't feel like I had stuff left on my teeth, and I didn't wake up with too terrible morning breath. I love that Crest offers savings on their products, and is a great value.
My teeth feel cleaner and look brighter. The toothpaste texture is not gritty or abrasive but gentle and still effective at cleaning your teeth and preventing decay. Would buy again over and over. I have a new favorite toothpaste, thanks Crest!
Crest oral care products are reasonabley priced (depending on the store) and they clean your teeth, taste great and used properly deminish the need for dental costly dental appointments. The Crest line of products seem to me to be the easiest to obtain cash off coupons for, a major incentive to stock up. I've used Crest products since I was a kid. I love them.
I loved the toothpaste and the floss. It left my mouth feeling clean.
I have been using Crest products since I was a kid. This is by far the best toothpaste and mouthwash I have used. Your teeth feel so clean and your breath so fresh. Your teeth actually feel like they are healthier after using these products. I have started using this ever since I received my sample. There are many different choices to choose from.
I love the way it works after the first couple uses. Glad to have something to whiten and freshen my breath
I loved the Crest...a little expensive, but great product.
I am very particular about toothpaste. I like my mouth to feel fresh after brushing and would like it to stay fresh realistically at least until mid-morning. This toothpaste is GREAT! It kept my breath smelling great. Made my teeth feel really clean. I have noticed a decrease of plaque on my teeth - I check before I brush my teeth at night. As for cavities, I will update after my dentist appt in a few months!
I felt fresh and clean for so long!!! I will definetly recommend and continue to buy!
Leaves teeth feeling very clean and fresh. Taste in mouth is great afterwards. Not a bad taste in mouth when brushing either.
My teeth are super clean.....no residue. Will continue to use.
its a great product-feels clean and fresh. it also has a nice smell to it
No leftover grittiness, keeps my teeth clean and I just got a great evaluation from my dentist.
I have always been a fan of Crest products. So, I was anxious to try this and see if it lived up to the hype. I really loved how fresh and clean my mouth felt. Definitely gets two thumbs up from me!
I love the fresh from the dentist feel my teeth had after using this toothpaste.
It cleans exceptionally well! leave your mouth really clean for 8 hours plus
I wish they would remove some of the junkie ingredients, I prefer Toms of Maine for this reason
I absolutely loved this toothpaste. I actually bought it for gift baskets for my brothers....Freshness lasts and feels clean not just minty.
My teeth felt so clean, I felt like I had just had a cleaning and the taste was great too, I loved that it was clear also instead of the "normal" white, would make easier to wipe off in a hurry without a full scrub down :)
Smile it works. I used this product for 1 week and what a difference, my teeth feel cleaner.
Overall, I would recommend this product. It cleaned my teeth well and freshned my breath.
I'm a stickler when it comes to toothpaste. Crest Complete fulfills all my family's needs. Clean teeth, fresh breath, healthy gums....I could go on and on. It has a great taste and even the kiddos aren't complaining about how it tastes. Thanks Crest!
I received a little of everything except the toothbrush so I tried it right away.The floss was better than most but still shredded between my teeth.The toothpaste was more pleasant than most but worked as well as most of their products.The mouth wash was great.
I love how clean and fresh my breath is after using the Crest Complete toothpaste. It leaves my teeth feeling so clean and looking whiter after using for a while. It is also gentle to my gums and not too alcohol.
Over all it was great it left my teeth feeling clean!
it completely cleaned my teeth, all the plaque was gone after barely beginning to brush. And it left my teeth feeling clean and not film like. I definetly recommend this product, just give it a try you'll Love it.
Always have loved Crest products. Great tastefeels clean for a longer time.
As an expectant mother, dental hygiene is very important to me and this product made my mouth feel very clean without the yucky taste of harsher products.
Definitely I will switch to Crest because i like them so much. The mouth rinse last for hours and the toothpaste too. I feel clean for hours.
I love these products and i never felt my mouth so clean and the whitening strips works great.
Loved the taste and the fresh clean breath feeling it gave.
We loved this toothpaste! Even my 6 year old liked the flavor!
I must say I really liked this product. I felt a noticible difference from my toothpaste I had been using. Leaves your teeth feeling clean.
Let me say that I really like and will be using Crest Complete from now on. It really works to help fight cavities and keep my mouth fresh and clean.
I really liked this toothpaste very much. I really liked the taste and it lasted a long time after I brushed
I like the clean feeling I got after brushing with this toothpaste.
I've switched from Listerine to Crest Complete. I prefer the alcohol free version, as it doesn't burn as much. The toothpaste is okay, but I need a sensitive version. Overall, the Crest Complete line is a well rounded offering.
I am a fan and user of Crest products and have been for years.I don't know that I prefer the new products to the old products, they are all great!
I prefer Crest over any other brand. I love the new clinical mouthwash and will continue to buy the floss and crest complete!
I loved the way this toothpaste made my teeth and mouth feel so clean. it's a great product and I will buy it.
This Crest Complete tooth paste not only taste great, but leaves your teeth so clean and smooth. I enjoyed that the product also comes in a whitening formula. The product surpassed my expectation and will continue to purchase.
Crest Complete is a great product, my teeth feel clean and I love the taste.
The crest toothpaste is a wonderful product that makes me very confident when using. It always does what it's "supposed" to do and what I "want" it to do and for that reason I will continue to buy crest products!
My mouth felt extremely clean. I would recommend this product for anyone
I have used Crest most of my life but really like how this makes myTeeth feel really clean
I loved the way this product left my mouth feeling fresh like I just left the denstist.
Great product. Tastes great, no burn and my mouth feels clean when I use it.
Left very clean feeling, great taste!! I will def be using this product again!
My teeth felt cleaner after using the toothpaste. It did not feel like paste in my mouth
I loved the toothpaste. It gave me a fresh clean mouth long after I brushed.
I find Crest to be the best toothpaste out there. Worth every penny.
This new Toothbrush from Crest is awesome! My teeth have never felt so clean! Give it a try asap!
Was very pleased with this product, my mouth felt fresh hours after brushing
I love it. I recommend this toothpaste to people everywhere. The freshness lasts for hours. My teeth are so white from it!
I and my family like brushing with Crest. Leaves teeth and whole mouth feeling really clean.
All of the Crest complete products are excellent. I especially like the clinical rinse. It isn't harsh and is long-lasting. I personally use only Glide floss: cant do with out it! I would definately reccommend this line to family and friends.
Loved the thorough and long lasting clean feeling! Everyone enjoyed the taste as well!
I love all these Crest products. I trust the company, and my family members' mouths are all super clean with the help of these coupons :) Great products, I would definitely recommend
I really enjoyed the taste. It left my mouth feeling very clean.
I couldn't believe the awesome clean feeling that was left in my mouth, let alone the taste! I recommend this product to everyone I see!
This product left my mouth feeling oh so fresh, will definitely buy again!
These products are awesome! The mouthwash works wonders and the toothpaste makes my teeth feel so clean and fresh!
I love this toothpaste. It made my mouth feel clean and the taste was great even though I prefer cinnamon flavoring I like crest products!
I tried the new Crest after eating out at an Itialian restaurant. It left my mouth feeling clean and my breath felt much fresher. It was a noticable difference over my regular toothpaste.
I loved the taste of the Crest Complete toothpaste and it left my breath feeling fresh for hours! This product is definitely worth buying.
After using Crest Complete for about a week, I did notice that my teeth appeared a little whiter. It was a dramatic difference, but I could tell. I'm an avid tea drinker, so I'm always on the lookout for whitening products. However, I also suffer from sensitive teeth, so I avoid harsh treatments.
I bought the Crest and I have to say that it is one of the best products out there! Will not buy any other brand!
I have used Crest products for years, so I was excited to try this new toothpaste. It seems to work as well as other Crest toothpastes, and my mouth is left feeling clean and minty. It's a very strong mint taste, so it stays in my mouth for a long time afterward. I don't know if it works any better than other Crest toothpastes, so I'm not sure it's worth the extra cost.
This products is great I just love it! I recommend it to all of my friends and family. :)
I recently bought the toothpaste and was very pleased ! It left a clean, refreshing feeling ! I would highly recommend this product !
The Crest toothpaste I used was really easy to use. I liked the taste and the after feeling of cleanliness. Don't know about the plaque yet but I think it did what it promised. The clean feeling of my teeth was really nice.
I've always used Crest products and have never been disappointed! These new Crest Pro-Health products simply improve upon something that was already a great product.I actually enjoy using the Clinical Rinse because unlike others it doesn't hurt my mouth to do. The tooth brush and toothpaste work well and I feel confident that my teeth are clean after brushing. The new floss works even better now that it slides so smoothly in between my teeth.
This is a very innovating product and is in charge of my family's good vocal health.
I really do like this product. It had a great fresh taste to it on top of everything, which is one of the top things I look for. I usually don't care how great something is for my teeth, it has to have a great taste, and I would say that was my favorite thing about this product.
I really like the Crest Complete toothpaste. It made my mouth feel fresh and clean for some time after brushing.
I am not a huge fan of Crest toothpaste, but this toothpaste I would definitely buy. I also only like the Glide floss. It is the only floss that is gentle enough on my sensitive gums and teeth.
I have always loved Crest products. These new products live up to the high standards that I've come to expect from Crest. I especially love the Pro Health Toothpaste - it cleans well and is enjoyable to use.
I have to admit, I was a little skeptical at first to try the new Crest product since I typically use the same version of Crest (original one without whitening, tartar control, etc.) since I thought they were all the same! I was wrong, I love this new product and will definitely purchase it again. My teeth felt clean and my breathe remained fresh for a longer period of time.Thank you for the opportunity to try another great product.
Works great! I'd highly recommend it! I'm a big fan of crest and prefer it over other brands on the market.
Crest Complete Toothpaste and Mouth Wash are so refreshing to my mouth. I will continue to buy these products
really love the way this brush gets the job done! think i finnally found the brush i will keep going back to!
My teeth feel so clean! I feel like I just had a visit to the dentist. I love the fresh, clean feeling it leaves. Crest Pro Health is better than some other mouth products out there. I told others about how great Crest Pro Health has made my teeth feel. I absolutly love it and will continue to use it
Crest Complete is a high quality product that gives you a clean mouth that last up to 4 hours. It protects against your teeth against bacteria and whitens too. It has a great minty taste that leaves no aftertaste. I would recommend it to all ages.
loved the products..it made my mouth feel very fresh and clean! :)
Crest is the best toothpaste on the market and this is another product that reflects their reputation.
These products are great. They are from a brand I trust and make my mouth feel clean.
My teeth feel and look cleaner than they have in years!!! I love it!!!
I was happy with the tooth paste. It made my teeth feel great
Crest has the best products. My teeth always feel so clean after I use their products and I've ever had less cavities!
This toothpaste not only works very well for teeth with sensitivity issues,but tastes great!I have tried all the other,Dentist recommended too,brands for this issue,but they taste horrible and feel like I barely brushed my teeth!Also the ones the Dentist recommended were expensive,Crest is not as much and you get a larger tube!
I love it!! It works extremely well. I love that it does not have the "stinging" eddfect when I am brushing!! Just a cool minty feel and afterwards, I feel like i have just gone to the dentist!! I definelty see the difference!
I tried the crest products n within a few days I noticed my teeth getting whiter and healthier. My mouth and my teeth felt so fresh and clean. I will definately keep on using this product to help my teeth get more healthier and prettier thanks crest great product!!!
I am a big fan of crest love their toothpaste and other products and this one is another great one to add to the list! And i would recommend it to everyone!
I love Crest! It works great and always do a great job. My dentist always says something great about my teeth.
The freshness lasts for hours. I love it. I recommend this toothpaste to families everywhere. Also, it's a great value.
I was very impressed with the toothpaste. Great taste and clean fresh aftertaste.
Refreshing - Bold - Excellent at cleaning, leaving mouth minty - teeth glossy!
I really enjoy using the Crest Complete Product line.
Highly recommend this product. Crest just keeps getting better and better. Best feature of all goes not give that strong taste at end just enough to know your mouth and teeth are clean but not too strong that if over powers you.
I will be purchasing this product again. It makes a difference in the brand and I love that my fav brand went out and improved itself :)
I have been using Crest for years. Honestly, since I was a child and now into my adulthood. I like how it doesn't leave that toothpastely residue in your mouth, but your mouth still feels clean!
I like to use this kind because of the minty flavor that it has with it.
it was great thank you- left my mouth fresh and clean
I like the minty flavor of the toothpaste. Also the toothbrush has a unique design.
I really enjoyed using Crest Complete. Very clean and lasting freshness!
Some toothpastes are very sticky feeling while using. But this toothpaste didn't do that. I loved the minty taste and it doesnt leave an bitter aftertaste in your mouth like some toothpastes do.
terrific fresh and clean result, leaves mouth sparkling. A little overpriced though for my wallet.
The flavor of the toothpaste was really refreshing. the mintiness wasn't over powering. my teeth felt nice and clean afterward.
This is the best toothpaste I have used in a while. I love the clean feeling it leave and the refreshing taste. My family has enjoyed this product.
I try the crest complete I really like it I like the way my breath feel fresh and my mouth was not dry it felt like my teeth were really clean it did not leave a paste feeling like some tooth paste
I really liked how clean my teeth felt after using it. I went to several stores and noticed that the price was really reasonable. The fresh mint taste wasn't as strong as some other brands out there. I would recommend to others to try it out.
I love how clean my mouth felt after brushing! I will definitely be buying this tooth paste again!
I've always used Crest and will continue to use these products since they make my mouth feel fresh and clean!
Loved all the Crest products I got to try with the coupons. My family likes the tooth paste, the floss and the mouth wash. Thanks for letting me try the great products!!
Doi. This stuff is great. My mouth has never felt this fresh. I should probably be worried about that...but I'm not because this stuff it so great!
The mint flavor was fresh & didn't burn my mouth which was such a plus. The mouthwash did leave a slight yet tolerable after taste. My teeth feel very clean after using this product.
I really like this toothpaste! It really made my mouth feel clean. I have trouble with sensitive teeth and it didn't seem to increase the sensitivity that some toothpastes do.
Just wish they have bigger size. The package is small for that price. I think I have to keep using it more and have more idea how well it works.
The taste was great and left a good, clean feeling.
Crest complete makes our teeth feel so clean. This is the only product we use.
it is tooth paste, it works and my teeth were clean
Made my mouth very clean. I loved the taste and how the toothpaste made my mouth feel like I got them cleaned at the dentist
I liked the taste and how it made my mouth feel but I don't like the price.
This Crest Complete gives you a clean feeling mouth,it lasted a long time.
I never really liked the taste of crest and this did not change my mind.
I liked it nice and clean! It left no residue. good value for the money.
great taste and left my mouth feeling really clean.
fantastic product left my mouth feeling fresh and clean
Crest is the best toothpaste of all time. It has a good taste and it works the best in my opinion. They have such a variety of products that everyone can find the one that will work best for them.
I found using all three of the products together gave a better result than when I have only used one or two in the past. Feel bright and fresh!
I received a sample of Crest Complete and it was really good. I like the way my mouth felt after using it and even the freshness that remained even after a few hours. It really provides complete cleaning and gets rid of a lot of food particles that might remain on your teeth. This is a product that I hsave decided to use along with other household members because I really feel protected when using it.
This toothpaste worked really well on cleaning my teeth and tasted great.
Was it just me? This product did not leave a "complete" deep cleaning in my mouth. Actually.. it left me feeling like it wasn't clean, & I ended up re-brushing.I didn't like it. But my roommates used it up! Maybe cuz I left it out?
Loved this product! Just bought more to continue to use in the future!
great product. does what it promises. love the way mouth feels clean and fresh.
It really glides and is gentle enough for sore gums and young children. My family no longer complains about flossing when they use this product.
I liked the minty flavor, but my husband thought it was too strong. He also prefers paste over gel which is what I like! Haven't noticed much of a difference whitening wise yet, but haven't used it for very long yet. I do like how clean my mouth felt afterwards.
This is a great product. Leaves your breathe feeling fresh and teeth feel extra clean. Will recommend to everyone I know.
I really liked the toothpaste and mouth wash. Even at the end of my workday, my teeth still felt smooth, like I just brushed them. Never experienced that with other toothpaste brands.
Love the new combination of products crest is showing us. Most don't tell you that certain products help clean you teeth if you use them together.
I love Crest products. Always feel like just have a dental check up everytime I use the toothpaste follow with the rinse.
I tried this and absolutely fell in LOVE with it! I loved how it made my whole mouth feel! I will def buy this product and recommnd it to others!
I tried the toothpaste and love it! It left my mouth and teeth feeling clean and had a teeny tiny bit of morning breath which is amazing compared to what it's normally like!
I tried the crest complete,and i love it .My mouth feel clean,And it clean my teeth better,Also i can drink my coffee and don't feel queezy after i brush.
Crest is an awesome product that taste good, works well and is a good price. I used all the products and feel that they work better than what I was previously using and have recommended it to many others.
I'm pretty particular when it comes to toothpaste and I have to say this Crest Pro-Health Clinical toothpaste is one of the best I've ever tried. My teeth feel smooth and clean and my breath is fresh for a long time. I haven't been to the dentist since I began using this product, but I think I will have a great checkup!
My breath seemed better in addition to my teeth actually seem whiter! Unlike many other products the taste isn't a manufactured taste! It's almost a natural taste!
I love this toothpaste. It makes my teeth feel so smooth and my breath stays fresh for hours. The added benefit of deep cleaning brightens my teeth and keeps them looking white. Will definitely buy this toothpaste again.
Im kind of a toothpaste snob (lol) and love Rembrandt toothpaste, however, Crest Complete met the challenge of meeting my requirements.
used it, wansnt too impressed. nothing really stood out that made me want to switch to this paste permanently.
I like the fresh feeling you get when you use this. It smells good and it cleans very well.
Of all the mouthwashes I've ever used, Crest Complete Clinical is by far the best. First night I used it I noticed cleaner teeth and mouth and really fresh breath. When I woke up the next morning, to my surprise, I had no morning breath! I could not believe how long the freshness lasts. My mouth has never felt so clean for so long. I'm definitely spreading the word about this mouthwash. I'm goin to try the toothe paste next!
I was very pleased with the new line of Crest and will keep buying it for my family.
Watch out for this floss! It will absolutely ruin every single other brand of dental floss out there for you. It's AWESOME and no other floss will compare. I ran out of this once and had to use some leftover brand from my ignorant days and I don't know how I could ever stand to use the stupid, coarse, stringy, shredding floss that is other brands. I can never quit you, Crest Glide.
I have always used Crest products. Ever since I was a child it's a family favorite. When Crest comes out with something new I am willing to try it. This new Crest Complete was great. Really got my whole mouth clean. Thanks Vocalpoint for letting me try it.
Not only does the amazing flavor make you feel like your mouth is getting the cleaning that it needs, it also helps to strengthen your teeth and whiten them all at the same time! This is a great product!
i smoke and it got stains off my teeth that i coun'nt get off, really great product, would reccomend for coffee and tea drinkers too
Makes my teeth feel clean and fresh. I will only use Crest!
I just started using this product. It has a nice fresh minty taste and leaves my mouth feeling refreshed.
I am picky about toothpaste and I love this product. A deep clean for sure. Leaves my mouth feeling VERY clean. Great minty fresh taste that lingers for hours. Leaves my mouth and breath feeling clean and fresh. Great price in stores. Have already purchased this product after sampling.
I would consider myself pretty picky when it comes to toothpaste. I want it to have a good flavor, leave my mouth feeling clean and my teeth feeling smooth, and the freshness has to last. This toothpaste did everything. I love how my mouth feels after using it and even still feels fresh when it's been a few hours. I've switched and now only buy this!
Everyone liked the flavor. Usually have to buy two different kinds of tootpaste.
loved this product, would recommend to others! really enjoyed

I love this toothpaste. I'm not a big fan of mint flavored anything, but I like this stuff. My whole mouth feels really clean after using this tooth paste, unlike some other brands.
While not necessarily a lot better than other toothpastes I've used, it really does make my teeth feel clean. I will buy it any time it is a good deal...this is my standard for pretty much all products, so I would call it a great endorsement.
I liked this toothpaste very much, as it was fresh and my teeth felt very clean. My husband also liked it but the kids didn't. I guess they prefer bubblegum flavor!
I love that feeling when you return from the dentist with recently cleaned teeth. This is as close as you can come to that - minty and thorough.
It left my mouth feeling fresh and clean, I have always been a crest fan but this just makes me love it even more.
Crest works great, clean teeth, taste good and last along tim.
I love the way this toothpaste leaves my teeth feeling smooth, like I just left the dentist office. I would recommend this to my friends and family, and I know I'm repeating myself but.. I just love the way this toothpaste leaves my mouth feeling clean and fresh.
My husband and I really like this toothpaste. It left our mouth feeling very refreashed.
crest complete plus my oral b electric toothbrush equals one great smile and super clean feeling teeth.
Love the product. Didn't leave a bad aftertaste or anything. Just fresh and clean feeling!
I love this floss. It is strong and works perfect for my teeth!
This toothpaste leaves a very clean feeling in your mouth. I love the taste of it and it does just what it says; completely cleans your teeth.
Crest Complete seems to be working great on my teeth. I bought the teeth whitening for sensitive teeth. Tho it works slower it does work.
I love crest!! This product was the best so far in toothpaste...Thanks for a wonderful product!
I liked that the mouthwash didn't burn and made my teeth feel clean all day. The price was a little more than I would usually pay which is why I didn't give it 5 stars.
The mouthwash is wonderful;it leaves your mouth clean and fresh for hours.The toothpaste is great tasting;it leaves your teeth clean and smooth.Great mint taste!
I love this toothpaste. It has great taste and a lasting clean feeling for both my teeth and whole mouth.
such a great product i will recommend this to all worth buying it
Excellent tooth paste and mouthwash. The toothpaste took most of the clinging plaque off my teeth and the Clinical mouthwash finished the job. Left my mouth as good as a dental cleaning.I love the mouthwash....it has peroxide in it. These Crest Clinical products used together or separtely kept my mouth fresh all day.I love them.Thank You Crest
Love Crest tooth paste! This is a great product, and now my son is also using it!
I love the way it makes my mouth feel so fresh and clean.
I have used crest as long as I can remember. I am proactive about my teeth. Between my daily regimen and using crest I haven't had a cavity in over 20 yrs.
I have always love Crest and believe it's product quality. It's even better with this new product that could fight cavities, while whitening my teeth. Love the clean, fresh scent, and knowing that that clean feeling last.
Awesome product line. Leaves teeth and breath feeling clean and refreshed
My teeth feel so clean, like just got out of the dentist. I love the fresh clean feeling it leaves in my mouth, that lasts for a long time, other than some other mouth products out there. My teeth are brighter and whiter. I told everyone I know about Crest Pro Health. I absolutly love it and will continue to use it.
I really liked this toothpaste. It did make my mouth feel cleaner longer. The quality of the product was excellent. I always like to use crest!
It was very refreshing felt after using this toothpaste! !!!
Great taste and good overall cleaning! Would definitely recommend trying this product!
Great product that fits the Crest brand well. I like the results.
keeps them healthy, whiter, and they feel cleaner.
I really did love using Crest complete. After about a week and a half of using I noticed that my teeth were looking much brighter. Definetly found a new toothpaste for me.
This worked great at cleaning my teeth. I loved the feel afterwards and the taste.
Crest complete is about your average toothpaste. It works, it tastes alright, and it has some whitening effect. I didn't really care for it overall. I didn't realize it was a whitening toothpaste when I first signed up for it, and I don't really like those.I've also recently been trying to go more organic, and this product clearly doesn't qualify for that.
I've always been a fan of Crest but they have outdone theirselves with the new ProHealth. It leaves my teeth feeling clean for a long time and freshens my breath for a long time. I've also noticed that my teeth are getting whiter.
Family has always used crest and now with crest complete we are loving it more.
My family loves Crest. It cleans your teeth great and the mouth wash makes your mouth feel fresh. We are very loyal to Crest.
This product made my mouth feel clean and fresh all day long. Loved it and would purchase it again.
Love, Love, Love this product. I really think Crest Pro-Health Toothpaste is the best product on the market right now to make your teeth feel the cleanest and look the whitest after brushing. And your mouth feels "fresh" too!
This is a great product that leaves a lasting and refreshing taste in your mouth.
Loved how my teeth felt after brush them with crest complete love the polished feeling and how my mouth felt clean.
Love this toothpaste, does a good job. My mouth and teeth felt really clean.
I love this; it is minty fresh without burning your mouth!!
I LOVED this product!! Left the clean feeling all through out the day! I ended up picking some more up at the store because I fell in love with it! No need for icky mouth wash! :)
I love the brand and the pro health is a favorite of mine, fresh breath and my teeth feel clean every time
The toothpaste really worked,my mouth felt fresh and clean.I will buy the toothpaste.
In my opinion Crest has always been a great brand anyway. This leaves your mouth feeling fresh and clean. It's really good! =)
I enjoyed the Crest toothpaste! It left my mouth feeling fresh for hours.
This is a great prouct. It worked well and my teeth felt so clean. I will recommend this to all my friends and family.
Loved the Fresh taste and smell! Mouth feels fresh longer.
Thank you for opportunity to try CREST COMPLETE . Tooth paste left my teeth smooth and mint taste was refreshing
This is a good tooth paste, works great and leaves you mouth feeling really fresh
I love the crest toothpaste it cleans my teeth and makes my mouth stay fresh all day. I recommend using it.
I tried the toothpaste and mouthwash. Both did a great job and were good at whitening my teeth. Felt very fresh!!!
In this household, we enjoy the Crest toothpaste which has a great minty taste in our mouths for clean and fresh breathe!
A clean and fresh sense and a great value would definitely buy it again. I loved the feel this product left in my mouth.
I bought the Crest Pro-Health for my daughter (plaque control) she's very picky about the "taste" of a toothpaste. She did not complain one bit....I will buy this again.
I really liked this toothpaste. It leaves my teeth feeling very clean and the taste is not overpowering either. I would recommend this product.
I love when I brush my teeth and can taste the toothpaste for awhile after. This product was like that! The mint made my whole mouth feel so clean!
This was simply another wonderful Crest product set out to prove that Crest, once again, is a top contender in the toothpaste field. Loved how it made my teeth shine, my breath fresh, and my mouth clean!
Creat product, leaves the mouth feeling fresh and clean.
The toothpaste is really good for all around use, I like the fact that it covers a lot of different things, like tartar control, whitening, things you wouldn't normally be able to find in one tube. It was good, it cleaned well, and I didn't mind the taste as much as I do in some pastes, it wasn't too strong.
Crest Complete left my teeth feeling clean and my whole mouth fresh. I would use it again. I trust the name brand Crest.
Great taste that lasts for a long time! I liked Crest before, but this just shows it continues to put out good products.
Made my mouth feel clean and fresh. Will definitely buy again!
Crest toothpaste is great. My teeth feel clean and fresh.
While I like the product and trust the brand, again, there is a gritty thing going on in this toothpaste, I Don't understand why they are doing this, maybe it is something that is suppose to get in to those hard to reach spots and help, but it just doesn't feel that good while brushing
Great product that tastes great and keeps my gums healthier.
I really love it. It is now my favorite! It works very well, and I like it better than any other brand that I have tried so far!
I love Crest! It makes my mouth feel fresh and has a great minty flavor.
Crest is the only kind of toothpast my family wants me to get now.
I really enjoyed this product and had long lasting fresh breath while using it.
I like it even though it left a strange after taste in my mouth.
prodcut was nice and the price was great... the taste was also great
I really liked this product, it made my mouth feel very fresh afterwards
This product was really good. It left my teeth feeling clean and mouth feeling fresh! highly recommend.
The texture is a bit surprising, it is gritty almost like using pumice on your teeth but the taste is actually quite refreshing and good. The flavor is very nice, its minty but not so strong that it burns your mouth. When I was done using it my teeth felt amazedly clean.
it is the only toothpaste i ever want to use i love it..the freshness that lasts a long time!
The use of this toothpaste reminds me of a professional dental cleaning. After my two-minute scrub, I took the time to explore how my teeth felt... I couldnt believe the smooth, sparkling surface left behind. This toothpaste not only cleaned extremely well, but my breath was minty fresh. This lasted for hours! The price of this product is great and packaging was eye catching!
Very fresh clean feeling after you brush. From the start it is like a burst of minty freshness
I loved this this product. It was decently priced and worked great.
After using this product my teeth feel like I just went to the dentist, fresh and clean!
I tried crest complete toothpaste and it really worked. It left my teeth really shiney and I loved that my breath was fresh. I really recommend this product.
I love this product and my whole family is using it.
Thanks for giving me a chance to try the new crest at a discount.I really enjoy using the toothbrsh.I like the tooth paste as well.
Good mouthwash really does the job and keeps my teeth feeling clean longer than regular mouthwash. Thanks.
I really liked this toothpaste. It made my mouth feel very clean.
I used the Crest Pro-Health Clinical Gum Protection in the soothing smooth mint flavor. It makes your breath fresh and it cleans my teeth very well. I drink alot of coffee and always think my teeth look off white but now that I brush with the Crest Pro-Health they look brighter and whiter than when I used the regular Crest tooth paste. I would recommend anyone trying it and give us a comment on what you think about it. I would rate it very good. (:
This is the toothpaste I have the most confidence and trust in.
I have always liked Crest products but have not been able to find a store that had them. The either did not carry or were out when I looked for them
crest is a toothpaste that does what it says it does love it
My family normally uses another popular brand but when we tried Crest pro health clinical (especially the mouthwash) I don't think we'll be going back to the old brand again. Thank you Crest for making a great product for a great price and Thank you vocalpoint for giving us the option to try it!
I love using crest,my mouth feels so clean.This has become the toothpaste of the household.
Fabulous toothpaste, even my 4 year old loves how sparkly his teeth are!
My family has loved Crest!!! This product cleans and works great!!
Has a great texture and taste. I think it will be a family favorite!
My family was brought up on Crest and thats the only thing i use for my family. Its the only toothpaste that gets my teeth really clean. Love the flavor of mint, not to strong just right.
It lives up to its claims. I will purchase it again.
Love crest complete products, the toothpaste is the best, switched my children to the toothpaste.
The samples were perfect to try these items. I love them all and would recommend them based on flavor and they avaliaility of savings.
Crest really made good toothpaste and mouthwash. It really works!
This toothpaste did not have any gritty aftertaste.
Toothpaste is such a personal preference. I liked it....and I think everyone should try it for themselves.
I LOVE THE TOOTHEPASTE AND MOUTHWASH. THEY LEAVE SUCH A FRESH FEELING AND ARE GREAT TASTING TOO!
I love this product. It works great and taste great!!
As always, lives up to the Crest reputation. Cleans and whitens just as described. Leaves mouth fresh.
Wonderful toothpaste! It really does feel like the most clean my teeth have been without going to the dentist. REALLY like this stuff!
Crest makes the best toothpaste! It has a good texture when brushing not like some other gritty or sticky toothpaste brands and Crest leaves your teeth feeling clean without any bad aftertaste.
Great Flavor & leaves teeth feeling amazing!! I will be recommending it to my family and friends.
great product definitely recommend it especially that crest is a trusted brand
I don't find anything special about this line. It seems like the average overall toothpaste/mouthwash.
I love this product because it really brought this fresh and tingly feeling (in a good way) to my mouth. I really loved how it easily scrubbed against my teeth and it eventually made my teeth just a bit white after a few uses. I felt a lot vibrant after using it and was really glad for the price and the results.
I love this toothpaste. Usually I'm not a fan of the taste toothpaste leaves in my mouth, but this left a refreshing mint taste. I loved it!
The taste was not to good. Thr aftertaste I did not like eithet.
Crest is amazing. It cleans and make my whole mouth healthy and clean without a big cost to me.
This product was just as I would expect from a great company like Crest!
Made my mouth feel refreshing. Loved the taste. Everyone in my family loves it. Wouldn't buy any other toothpaste
The Crest toothpaste was wonderful. This is the best toothpaste.
I love crest, but I thought it would work even better then the results I received. It does work, but I thought it would work wonders like it shows in commercials.
This toothpaste is great and leaves your teeth andmouth feeling clean and refreshed.
the greatest ever! i normally use another brand but i think i'll switch
tried the crest complete toothpaste. tasted good and saw that my smile was better after a week or so. so good to use
We love crest toothpaste! It's the only toothpaste we buy!
Tried this product and my whole family loved it! It is the only brand we buy now! Great experience!
I really liked this stuff. Thanks. I will buy it for my family.
Crest has been a name around the house for a long time. This toothpaste has a great taste. It is among the pricier products out there, but our teeth are worth it.
I USED THIS PRODUCT AND ITS VERY FRESH A LEAVES VERY CLEAN MY THEETS I USED EVERY DAY AND AND SMELL GREAT TOO
This is the best toothpaste and mouthwash ever. Leaves mouth feeling clean and fresh. Love it!!!!!
This mouthwash tastes great and does not burn/sting.
I will definitely recommend this product to family and friends! the coupons helped to make it affordable! The fresh taste and fantastic results made this sample a huge success!
I go back and forth between a couple of brands, but my family really does prefer Crest. It's been my brand ever since I can remember and I trust it. I like how my mouth feels after brushing with the new Crest. More importantly, my son likes it.
First let me start by saying that I only ever use Crest products when it comes to dental hygien, I HATE everything else. However, I wasn't impressed with this toothpaste. IMO, it's just average. My teeth don't feel any cleaner or whiter and my gums don't seem to be benefiting either. It's a decent price for what you get, but I will be switching back to Pro-Health gum protection. I'm not saying it's a bad product, just not the one for me.
Teeth felt clean and smooth and stayed fresh for a long period.
I love Crest, that's the only brand I buy for toothpaste. I like the mouthwash also, I went and bought the mouthwash, 1st time trying Crest brand. I like it
I will not buy any other toothpaste, Crest works amazing! I highly recommend it!
This certainly gives a super clean teeth feeling! Fresh breath and clean teeth are an unbeatable combination!
I tried the new Crest toothpaste and Crest Clinical mouthwash and love it. I had trouble getting my kids to use mouthwash until the Crest Clinical I brought home. Its got the best taste and it doesn't leave your mouth stinging. I use them together and the kids think that's pretty cool. The floss is really good too. Its easy to use and doesn't shred like the old kind we used. Thanks so much. My family is truly full of Crest kids.
This product left my mouth feeling clean, just like I left the dentist's. I definitely recommend it and will purchase in the future.
I was very pleased with the flavor, and the refreshing feel and how clean my teeth seemed to be after using.
this was an awesome product and so glad I was able to try it....will buy again!
I really enjoyed it! So did the rest of my family. It is something we will use again if the price is right!
Crest Complete toothpaste does a great job at keeping a mouth clean. Crest is usually more expensive, but it is a good quality product.
wow.....after trying a number of not-so-useful products, i finally find this toothpaste has benefits like fresh breath,anti cavity protection and totally refreshing flavor.Now i use it regularly.Thanks vocalpoint for letting me know the best.
A noticeable difference compared to my regular toothpaste. Left my mouth feeling clean for hours.
i used this toothpaste for the first time and thought " i'll never use another one, EVER". love it!
Never have my teeth felt cleaner, This toothpaste is awesome.
crest has always been the brand i choose. like the minty refreshing taste. :)
I absolutely love this product. It seems to keep your whole mouth fresher longer. With other brands, it seemed that my teeth felt dirty by mid-morning but with this new Crest product, the freshness lasted. It wasn't harsh or abrasive to my gums or teeth. I would highly recommend this to anyone.
I liked Crest Complete. It worked well, but it was a little pricey.
I've been brushing with Crest since I was a kid so I'm always up to trying out new types of Crest. This one does as advertised -- it leaves your teeth feeling clean and the minty taste does linger for a good while afterwards.My only complaint (and this has been mentioned by others) is the price point. Given my current income, I think I'll stick with the original tube for now.That being said, it *is* a good product. I'm happy to see P&G/Crest has kept up their standard of excellence.
This line of products deep cleans and makes your whole mouth feel cleaner. Enjoyable experience.
My husband will only use Crest and it was fun to try the latest addition to their line up. As expected, we were impressed with the results (fresh clean feeling mouth).
it got my teeth so white i love this stuff its a great price for a great product
Crest is a very innovative brand: always comes up with new products and Crest Complete is definitely a great toothcare product.
Highly recommended - great clean feel for the entire family. Great taste also.
I have always liked Crest but this product made me love Crest.
But it has a bit of a bite to it. The flavor is a bit strong for me. I usually use tom's
I use this toothpaste everyday and I love it. It keeps my teeth white and my mouth feeling clean for longer than other toothpastes.
great product will use every day from know on.really makes your mouth feel clean and fresh
I love this toothpaste and will definitely be using it from here on out!! My teeth feel so smooth and my whole mouth just feels cleaner :) LOVE IT!!!
I received the toothpaste sample. I tried it a few days later and liked the result. Not any more special then regular toothpaste. I did like the taste!
This is an excellent product. Good for the family. None of the family had any complaints. Pleasant taste as well.
this product is wonderfull!!! leaves your teeth feeling really clean
Love the fresh minty taste. Leaves my mouth feeling clean and fresh.
I have enjoyed this product. It tastes good, cleans effectively and most of all works great during the night for some reason. Keeps my mouth from getting nighttime mouth and I wake up with a clean mouth!
This toothpaste did a great job of cleaning my teeth and left a pleasant taste in my mouth. What more would one want of a toothpaste?
I like the toothbrush alot. It does the job of getting your teeth cleaned!
Honestly my teeth have never felt so clean. I always use the regular Crest but definitely switching over.
Crest is great! We all love it in our house! I recommend everyone to try it out.
It leaves your mouth feeling fresh.Thats what I love about it.
With Crest Pro-Health I feel my mouth really clean and fresh.
It makes your teeth feel really clean and it tastes pleasant. My teeth and mouth feel very similar to when I come back from the dentist and it feels that way all day long.
Crest is my all time favorite. It leaves my mouth feeling fresh and squeaky clean.
I was very satified with the product. Crest is a brand that my family has used for years with great satisfaction.
I liked this toothpaste, good flavor. I wish Crest offered a natural toothpaste though.
This is a great toothpaste; it has great flavor. Will definitely use again.
It does the job in a much easier way and no unpleasant taste afterwards!
I liked the toothpaste. I wish it came in the regular flavor.
This is the one product, we all use in the house without any complaint and everybody loves it.
Thanks for the sample, We loved the toothpaste it had a great taste and made our teeth feel great - will be buying this from now on... THANKS
This is a great product absolutly loved it it really doe's work!
Really like this toothpaste! The taste is good. A little pricy, but worth the price!
This toothpaste left my teeth feeling clean the entire day. Absolutely loved.
Will honestly never use another toothpaste! It left my teeth feeling as clean as coming from the dentist.
I love the feeling of the crest toothpaste, it made my teeth feel clean and not leave a weird film on my teeth like other ones.I also liked the scope mouthwash because I like the tingly clean feeling in my mouth.
Crest is the only brand used in our house,we love it.
Great toothpaste, works great, goes on smooth and taste good. Leaves teeth clean, white, and without unpleasant aftertaste.
I Love Crest Complete! it has become my favorite toothpaste!
This product is great because it not only left my mouth feeling clean, but it did not have a harsh taste or feel like other whitening toothpastes have.
Great toothbrush got my mouth so clean my teeth sqeaked! The tooth paste lt my mouth feeling clean and fresh! I would recommend to others and continue to use myself!
My family & I have always used it. It makes our teeth clean and healthy. I trsut it because Ive been brought up on it. So has my husband, so you know we will give it to our kids too.
the bestthanks for sending me the product is very good i like leave your teeth spectacular thank you very much!
The toothpaste made my mouth feel like I had just gotten my teeth cleaned by the dentist.
My breath stayed fresher longer than with other oral products. Have completely switched over to Crest Complete now!
It really does last for up to 4 hours. Great clean feeling! This product is the best value for the product.
I loved the Crest Pro Health mouth wash and tooth paste. They left my mouth feeling clean and refreshed. I noticed with the tooth paste that my teeth were whiter, than when I used other leading brands. Best past was knowing that I was doing something that was helping my overall dental health!!!!
I now have my whole family using it and we love it. My teeth feel so clean after.
This product leaves your mouth very clean and I highly recommend it
I bought the Crest Clinical Toothpaste, and mouthwash. I love it. It leaves your mouth feeling soo fresh, and clean.
This is a great product! Love the way it taste and freshness that it gives my mouth!
Very good product makes your whole mouth fresh and tingly.
This toothpaste not only left me with a fresh, clean mouth, but I actually started to notice a difference in the whiteness of my teeth after about 2 weeks. Will definitely continue using it!!
I love crest complete just as much as other crest products. My teeth felt clean and seem to be slightly whiter.
Great product, and not too pricy, unlike other products. Will buy again!
The name of this toothpaste says it all . . . Complete! It has everything in one tube so there's no need to use various products while brushing your teeth. I've noticed that I'm even purchasing more of this toothpaste lately because everyone in my family seems to be brushing more and they love it also.
Made my breath smell great and teeth clean. Made my mouth feel clean
Crest Complete makes your mouth feel fresh and clean. It's the only toothpaste product we use in our house!
I love the smooth feeling and great minty taste of Crest. It makes you want to run your tongue over your teeth twenty times a day!
Crest Pro-Health toothpaste is terrific! I love the taste, how it feels in my mouth, it has just the right amount of foam and best of all, it gives me a 'dentist clean' feel everytime I use it. I have used other versions of Crest, but Pro-Health will be my toothpaste of choice from now on.
We absolutely love this product. It's refreshing and leaves our mouth feeling clean the whole day and smelling just as good. Definitely my family's favorite and #1 Top Choice.
great taste kids loved it perfect for whole family
Clean teeth, fresh breath, minty tongue, mouth felt this way a while. :0
I loved this product. It left my mouth feeling clean and fresh.
I thought it was a little on the pricier side, but maybe that was just the drug store I purchased I at. Overall my mouth felt quite clean after using it. Would recommend.
I really like the way this product left my teeth & mouth feeling. I would recommend anyone to use the. Thanks for a good products.
I love the crest complete toothpaste. So does the rest of my family. It makes your mouth feel so clean, and invigorating. I have recommended it to all of my family and friends, and now I would like to recommend it to you. Give it a try, and you will see what I'm talking about! :)
love the way this toothpaste keeps my mouth feeling fresh like just comming from the dentist office after a cleaning
I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of this toothpaste. It left my mouth feeling fresh and clean throughout the day.
I love a minty-tasting mouth after my brushing my teeth, but for some reason this one tastes a little more medicinal than I think it should. I like most Crest products, but I think I'll stick with my Colgate Total for brushing my teeth.
Loved it! Made my mouth feel really clean. I also really liked the flavor.
is the only product on the shelf that helps my sensitive teeth. The abrasion feeling makes me feel I just left the dentist office!
My teeth feel really clean after I use the Crest Pro Health products. Great job Crest.
I really loved themand it made me switch from what I usually use. It makes my mouth feel so fresh and so clean.
The dental products worked great and I loved the taste.
Our whole family loves this new toothpaste. We have always loved the Crest Brand, but now we are in love with the "Complete" toothpastes. We like the flavor and the way it cleans. It leaves our mouths feeling nice and fresh and clean.
This is one of the best tooth paste I've used, I love it.
I love this product, my teeth and tongue have never been happier.
I have always used Crest products, but I really enjoyed the new Crest Complete! Everyday I used Crest Complete it left my teeth feeling like I had just come from a Dental cleaning visit! Crest complete polishes your teeth, leaves your mouth feeling super clean, and it helps keep those teeth bright!
Absolutely gave my family that fresh from the dentist clean!
I love the crest Pro Health Clinical. It makes me feel like my mouth is completely clean. The Tooth paste is my fav., because it makes my teeth have that fresh out of the dentist feel.
This is a great product helps whiten has a good flavor and your mouth feels refreshed after brushing
When I first tried the product I could already tell the difference. The minty feeling lasted longer and made me feel that my mouth was clean.
Love, love, LOVE this toothpaste! We usually use Colgate complete, but as soon as I tried this Crest, I fell in love. My mouth stayed clean & fresh for hours, and my teeth haven't felt this clean since I went to the dentist. Try this toothpaste - you'll love it, too!
I Love the product. I use it all the time and have told my friends and family how great it is
I love this toothpaste, it makes your teeth a shade whiter like in a week. The taste and smell is like mint listerine but it's ok.
I always expect to pay a little more for quality, but, in this case, it's cost is comparable to other name brand items. It tastes great and whitens. My family will use crest.
This product is a great product for my family. It is the only one that we use.
Loved using the toothpaste and mouthwash! Gave me a real clean feeling! I can't wait to get more!
Teeth felt really clean and the flavour was especially awesome
Crest does it again, lots of choices for different tooth hygiene needs, affective and easy to use!
Love the minty freshness of this toothpaste. Keeps them clean for a very long time. Kills bad breath.
I really liked the toothbrush, it was firm and reach in places its normally hard to get to. the toothpaste had a good taste, i felt like i came from the dentist, i would use again and again.
I love thist toothpaste! I used it and loved the mint flavor and it kept my teeth feeling super clean. Will buy this toothpaste again.
I really liked it. I would recommend this product to my friends and family.
This makes my teeth feel so fresh! This product is great.
I absolutely loved the Crest Pro Health mouth wash!!! It made my teeth noticeably whiter. It leaves your mouth fresh and feeling clean. I really like the fact that it does not really burn your mouth to much. I will not use anything else now. I have recommended this to people and they have also tried it and came to me telling me the same thing that it works great. The only thing I would have to say that is bad about this product would be it leaves a weird film in your mouth not sure why or what it is but I could pull through it. You could remove it from your mouth or not get it at all if you would rinse your mouth with water right after you use the mouth wash.
*Refreshing flavor*Long lasting minty flavor*Cleans teeth*Feel confident you have fresh breath and clean, health teeth* Product that is used in my home and the family loves the results!
The new crest toothpaste was awesome it was fresh and felt clean.
My entire family loved using this toothpaste. Our teeth felt clean and smooth and it kept our breath fresh for hours!
I love the not over powering minty flavor and my mouth feels so clean afterwards and it feels clean longer.
Great toothpaste! Lasting minty flavor. My mouth and teeth felt clean and healthy!
Wish the price was a little lower but besides that it is a great product that seems to work better than others we have tried.
Crest has always been my favorite brand of oral cleaning products. Many products are too minty, but I have never found that to be true of Crest. Crest Pro Health Clinical is superior for oral care. My mouth always feels clean and fresh with Crest, and Pro Healthy has convinced me that Crest keeps on giving!
I am a big fan of Crest toothpaste and this doesn't dissapoint.
I only use Crest toothpaste and floss - I find their products to be of the best quality. I love the new Crest Complete - another great addition to their product line!
Great product.. Can't explain how clean and fresh my mouth felt after using it ! Love it !!!
Crest is the only toothpaste we use in our family cleans teeth and leaves freshness all day and also prevent from gums i would recommend it.
There are all kinds of toothpaste, so to have a toothpaste like this one that really cleans your teeth is excellent. I felt like my teeth were clean after I was done. The minty taste was good and kept my mouth feeling fresh.
sooooooooooo nice and clean! my hobby really love it! I am very happy with it too!
I really liked the Crest Pro Health Clinical Mouthwashes and Toothpaste. They both work together to give you the best smile possible and that's what everyone is looking for right?
I would definitely recommend the Crest toothpaste. Not only do I love this toothpaste so do my husband and my sons. We are fans.
Love Crest products. They never disappoint. overall decent taste, no bad after taste. like the results. will continue to use.
This is a great line of products and I love how clean my mouth feels after using them! They can be expensive without a coupon but the products do work well.
This toothpaste is wonderful because it leaves your mouth feeling very clean and refreshed for a longer period of time than other brands of toothpaste.
I really like this crest toothpaste, it leaves my teeth and mouth feeling really clean. It has a nice minty flavor ,but is not over powering. I really like crest products, they work really well and are easy find in the grocery stores.
My husband said it made his mouth feel alive ,refreshing .He asked me not to buy anything else. That speak's volumes to me. Usually he's passive.
We loved this toothpaste and will buy it again. Our teeth felt so clean and fresh!
The only toothpaste I use. It's all we ever have in our house.
until we tried crest pro-health we would switch brands or whatever was on sale. this what we will be buying from now on. thank you.
I'm very fussy about my toothpaste and expect it to taste good as well as keep my teeth clean. Crest leaves my teeth feeling very clean and mouth very fresh.
I received a sample of some Crest Pro-Health products. I am especially enjoying the toothpaste that I received. I feel my mouth is cleaner, the taste is great and doesn't burn my mouth, and it creates enough 'suds' to where I feel like my teeth are getting clean enough. Thanks!
My mouth felt "squeaky clean" with the Clinical toothpaste! It is great, but I simply prefer Crest Complete over the Clinical line.
This product costs more than your average toothpaste, but works better than your average toothpaste too.
I loved the toothpaste! My teeth never felt cleaner and I loved the delicious minty aftertaste!
Crest is the only tooth paste and mouthwash we use. I love there products. We have tried other brands but they just aren't as good a Crest. I would rather spend a little more money and buy Crest.
I love to try new products and see what they have to offer and I can honestly tell you this toothpaste was amazing. I loved the clean feeling it gave my teeth and the fresh smell that it gave my breathe.
This product worked well. It does what it says it will. But, the retail price is very high. There are other products on the market that will work just as well.
Good, foamy toothpaste. love the whitening factor.
Love this product! Great minty taste and has an "extra clean" feeling. I love using this product.
I love all crest products, but this one is great. Lots of toothpastes and mouthwashes have a really overpowering minty taste, but not Crest. I've always used crest, always will. These products just make it even better. The pro health toothbrush from Oral B is really nice too.
I have only used this for a week so honestly I do not know if it is keeping plaque from coming back as quickly. However, it does an amazing job of keeping my mouth and teeth fresh for hours after I have brushed! I have also noticed that my coffee stains on my teeth have started to fade.
love the way my mouth feels! Would recommend this to everyone.
Just like the name this is the Total toothpaste. If I didn't enjoy flossing as much as I do, I wouldn't have felt like I needed to after using this.
Love this product, my teeth felt so much better and looked so much better after using this toothpaste along with the mouth wash. It kept my teeth feeling fresh and clean all day.
The products are of great quality and leave your smile looking amazing.
I liked it, made my teeth feel really clean!! I would definitely recommend this product.
Now I only use this toothpaste, it definitely works great!
Just another great example of how products fit into the Crest family.
I love it and this is now my only toothpaste. This product works wonders. whitens teeth, freshens breath, lasts all day... )))
When buying things like toothbrushes, toothpaste, and mouth wash I am never sure what I should be getting to keep good oral health. I loved the Crest Complete products because they left my mouth feeling fresh clean. I could see a difference in my teeth within 2 weeks.
The toothpaste worked well removing plaque and left my mouth feeling fresh. It was also great tasting.
I love brushing my teeth with this. It makes your whole mouth feel cleaner.
the toothpaste was really great and kept us feeling fresh until morning
My man has always been super pickey when it comes to toothpastes. He never likes the was they taste and it makes brushing teeth an ewwy experience. The only brand he likes now is Crest and uses the Pro-Health toothpaste eveyday. It's the only toothpaste he can find that doesn't have a nasty taste.
Anytime my 2 teenagers will use a toothpaste without complaining, it must taste pretty good.Left my teeth feeling clean.
My family used this product and they all liked it, saying that it didn't burn their mouth when they used it. As in some toothpaste as you use it, it tends to burn their mouth with the alcohol that is in it. They could handle the taste where it's not strong tasting while it cleans their teeth. I would rate it as a excellent product if my kids like it.
Some toothpaste leave my mouth still feeling stinky, not this one! Love how minty fresh and clean I feel each time I use it.
I really liked how clean and long lasting my teeth felt when I used this product!
I really liked the minty refreshing taste of the toothpaste. The mouthwash made my mouth feel so clean.
My 18 year old likes the taste as well as the way her teeth felt after use.We will buy this brand.
Crest left my teeth cleaner and whiter than other brands have and my breath was fresher.
All of the Crest Complete line is now my whole family's go-to choice for dental care. My husband likes the Night variety, my son uses the Kid's line and I like the Whitening formula.
love the bubbly clean feeling. the price is a bit steep but you get what you pay for.
These are great but I really don't see a difference between this and other Crest products
Everyone in my family loved it! Great taste and made my mouth feel clean.
Clean and refreshing. Can't wait to use it more than just a sample.
I love a toothpaste that makes my mouth feel clean and fresh!
I love this toothpaste! It makes my teeth and mouth feel so clean. They are right, it is like a daily facial for your mouth!!
We have tried the toothpaste and mouthwash and I LOVE both products! My whole mouth felt clean longer than with my old toothpaste. I feel like my mouth seemed cleaner and less build up at the end of the day. Thanks Crest for another GREAT product!
I love the way the Crest Complete makes my mouth feel. I feel really clean and fresh for hours after flossing, brushing, and rinsing.
Love the great refreshing blast from this great toothpaste! Teeth felt clean and my breath was fresh for the day!
The Crest products are all that I use and I love them and I was not disappointed in the Crest Pro Health sample that I received. Just wished that it was not as expensive
Loved this toothpaste. My husband even commented on how white my teeth were!
Made my teeth nice and clean!! I recommend this to everyone!
This is my all time favorite toothpaste! It has a great taste and leaves my teeth feel smooth and clean! Not to mention its also a really great value!
after use gives you that fresh and clean feeling i will defenity continue using crest
My family (hubby, 3 kids and myself) all love Crest Complete. It makes your whole mouth feel clean. It has a great flavor and makes your mouth feel fresh.
This product has a great minty taste that my entire family loves. We have switched to Crest as our main toothpaste brand.
I have tried many brands of toothpaste, mouthwash, floss etc and none have ever worked as good as Crest Pro Health. We are always in search of the next best product out on the market, but not anymore. Crest Pro Health truly works, the search is over. My teeth are slick, clean and my breathe is fresh- no need to try any other brands ever! Thank you, Crest for making superb products that I can trust for my family.
I always trust Crest with all my dental needs for me and for my family. Great flavor and leaves my mouth feeling fresh and clean for most of the day.
excellent product my family uses it and i would highly recommend to anyone
I think the product worked well not only cleaning my teeth, but left a pleasant taste in my mouth.
This product has good taste and gets my mouth very clean. It makes my teeth tingle and shine.
The best toothpaste to get your teeth really clean.
The crest prohealth rinse was extremely affordable and makes my mouth feel so much cleaner. I find its not harsh tasting like other brands and it gives a tingly feeling while its cleaning your mouth. I love this
We tried the new Pro-Health Clinical mouthwash from Crest. I noticed a difference in how much fresher my mouth felt, both after brushing and just for a "fresh up" in the afternoon.
This product was quite refreshing and quite good at whiting teeth. I enjoyed the taste of the product line.I recommend this brand.
The Crest complete toothpaste sample I received I would recommend and found it to be refreshing with its flavor
Worked great. Love the idea of deep cleaning. The taste is also great and fresh feeling.
Left my mouth feeling clean and refreshed. It is quite a bit pricier than other toothpastes.
I love the way that it made my teeth and mouth feel after i brushed my teeth.
I love the product , i feel my teeth polished and so clean from plague
I love my breathe after using this toothpaste. It is a little pricy but worth it. Makes your teeth, tongue and mouth to feel fresh. I highly recommend it!
I always bought crest toothpaste, toothbrush, rinse and more! We love them!
Works good! Very impressed. Love using this product everyday.

It leaves my mouth feeling fresh all morning long. I really love it!!
I love the way my teeth felt after brushing. They were so clean and the taste was great.
Great clean feeling!! Will continue to use this product
Love the minty taste of the toothpaste. Also the mouthwash left my mouth feeling fresh for hours afterwards.
I love the Pro Health Crest products!! The toothpaste makes my teeth look and feel good. The product with Scope makes my mouth feel fresh and clean. I will definitely purchase again.
Last night I used this toothpaste for the first time and I loved how my teeth felt smooth and clean and it left a pleasant taste in my mouth. Even now the next morning my teeth still feel smooth and clean.Almost like dentist visit clean.Thanks Crest for a wonderful toothpaste!!!
The crest pro-health toothpatse kept my mouth feeeling cleaner longer , especially after a dental cleaning. It gave me a great look and feel without tha grit that most other toothpaste contains.
I just love this toothpaste. I love the bubble action and it really feels like it tackles the build up and tarter. My teeth look and feel whiter and brighter.
I am in love with the Crest Clinical Rinse! It left my mouth feeling super fresh and I looked foward to using it the next time.
Brushing my childrens teeth in the morning use to be a HUGE ordeal! But not anymore they dont mind it now with this new Crest toothpaste. My daughter even asked this mornign it she could "do it myself" and she ACTUALLY BRUSHED THEM!
Love the minty flavor that lasts long. Makes my mouth feel fresh and clean!
I love this toothpaste. It leaves my teeth clean and white. I have a difficult time with some of the strong flavors of other toothpastes, but not Crest Complete has just the right amount of mint. I would recommend this product over other brands.
i actually used this is Canada, while living there the last 2 years but under same name but different division,, and i it then , that i brought some home with upon completion of my 2 yr tour and am so happy to see that now i can keep using it,,, its tastes great and keeps teeth clean and white :)
The product is really great. I purchased the complete toothpaste and the mouth rinse. Excellent. I felt like I'd been to the dentist office. Excellent taste and leaves you're teeth very white and great on your gums. I top off with the rinse and have been getting good reports from my Dentist. I will continue to use and have sent some to my mother and son. Thanks for very good preventive products.
We LOVED this toothpaste. It made my teeth feel cleaner than any other toothpaste ever has. It had a great flavor that even my kids liked!
Great toothpaste! leaves your mouth feeling fresh and clean all day!
I enjoyed using this product. Made my teeth feel clean and my breath fresh.
GREAT toothpaste, not to strong so perfect for my whole family!
I tried the Crest pro-health toothpaste and got a great check-up. In fact, the dental tech said I was doing an excellent job of brushing. Since I haven't really changed my brushing technique, I have to give the credit to Crest.
I really like the Crest Complete toothpaste - it gives a clean feeling throughout the day. I'm not sure it's worth the extra price, though.
Crest Complete was a great toothpaste that made your teeth feeling really clean and breath fresh, I would definitely by it again.
I have used Crest since I was a child, and this new Crest really lives up to the name. It is a wonderful product and a pleasure to use.
With the price and performance of this product I don't think the value is there. Not a fan.
Great minty taste,makes my mouth feel fresh and clean and only oral products we will use from now on...
Always leaves my mouth fresh and feeling clean! Not the cheapest toothpaste in the world but the quality is hard to beat.
This toothpaste has an amazing ability to freshen and make my mouth feel dentist clean!! Definetly would recommend to friends and family
I really enjoy using this product. It is smooth to sensitive gums!
I loved this toothpaste. My mouth felt 150% clean while freshening my breath. We used it all up & I didn't get a chance to buy more so we had to use what was on hand (another brand). We could tell the difference immediately. This toothpaste is far superior.
This toothpaste makes my mouth feel clean and fresh.
I absolutely love the entire Pro-Health Clinical Crest product line. I've been a long time fan of Crest in general and this made my love for it even better. I always feel as though I've been to see the dentist, because my teeth feel super clean after each use. I'm new to Oral-B products though. I enjoyed using the Oral-B Glide dental floss. My gums love me now! Both product lines are decently priced as well. Thank you very much for allowing me to try them!
I absolutely love this product. I have been wanting to try something different. It works good.
Crest is our family toothpaste, we like the flavour and long lasting freshness. great
I bought Crest Complete and Crest ProHealth rinse. Together they give your mouth a freshness of clean everything. Clean mouth. Clean teeth. Clean breath. That's what I need to wake up in the morning. A fresh clean feeling that lasts!
left mouth fresh and clean. Teeth sparkled.Had a very refreshing taste in the mouth.
I absolutely love the toothpaste and mouthwash! Both of these products left my mouth feeling fresh, clean and minty! It was almost as if I'd left the dentist office after getting my teeth cleaned. I would recommend this product to any of my friends and family, as this is a brand I can trust!
I have a hard time using other toothpaste after using Crest. There is an extra greatness and quality about it that you can't find in other brands.
we all really liked how clean our mouths felt after using this toothpaste
I liked the toothpaste, but not this flavor! I already bought it in a different flavor and love it!
Like the way it made my mouth feel but I don't know if I liked it enough to spend the extra money. I have a family of five and the tubes of toothpaste don't seem to last, this one was a little smaller than the large one I usually buy so it didn't make it very lnog in my bathroom.
i loved using the crest toothpaste cleaned my teeth really good
my mouth smells fresh longer and whiter and cleaner awesome product
This will be the only floss I purchase for my family. It works great. Glides through our teeth without getting caught.
There are very few mouth washes that I actually don't mind using, but I do enjoy this particular line of Crest. Refreshing, clean feeling without the sting.
crest is always good.I love the taste of it and doesnt taste weird after brushing or cleaning mouth.I would recommend it to everyone.Right now I am a daily crest product user.Thanks vocal point for the samples
Toothpaste left my mouth feeling clean longer than other brands and types. I especially liked the glide floss. It was effective and gentle on my gums.
If you want clean teeth and a fresh mouth, this is your product to try!
My mouth is feeling super clean and ready for my checkup!
My hubby uses mouthwash before leaving for work every morning... mainly to rid himself of smelling like cigarettes. He says this crest mouthwash has been the best at eliminating the smell and has been the best tasting out of all the brands he has tried!
I like the way it cleaned my teeth and made my mouth feel fresh and not dry and pasty
I have been a Crest used since I was a kid. My parents only bought that brand. I have tried others and keep going back to Crest. The value is great, and so is their quality. Your teeth and mouth will never be cleaner and happier as they will be after using Crest. HIGHLY reccomend switching brands if you use something else. Its been rock solid for years!! Thank you Crest!
Good toothpaste but was not what I was looking for in a toothpaste. Daughter liked it more than I did.
I only buy Crest products for my family. We love the Radiant Mint 3DWhite toothpaste and Glide Pro-Health Floss. I all so use the Oral-B Professional Care rechargeable toothbrush, I love it. I Recommend Crest to all!
I would and HAVE recommended this product to many. Love it love it love it!!!!
I thought the Crest toothpaste was very refreshing. I liked the minty taste and the clean sensation after brushing.
I am now a Crest Convert!! My teeth have never been whiter, look better and feel cleaner. Crest is amazing and everyone should try it!!
This product makes my teeth feel clean and fresh, the plaque on my teeth is cleaned off and my mouth still feels fresh throughout the day. I would recommend this product to anyone!
tHIS PRODUCT WORKS WELL. iT MAKES MY TEETH BRIGHTER AND WHITER AND FEELS ABSOLUTELY GREAT AND HELPS TO KEEP THEM CLEAN AND MY MOUTH FRESH ALSO . I REALLY ENJOYED USING THIS PRODUCT AND I DEFINITELY WOULD RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO ANYONE WHO IS LOOKING TO BETTER THEIR HEALTH CARE REGIMEN WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO DENTAL HYGIENE. tHE PRICE IS A BIT UP THEIR BUT IT IS WELL WORTH IT DUE TO THE CONVENIENCE AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THE PRODUCT.
The toothpaste tasted great and left a nice feeling on my teeth.
Wonderful toothcare products that have a great taste and leave your teeth feeling cleaner than ever. I also use sensitive toothpaste on a regular basis, but I like to change those out with this Crest alternative whenever I can. My mouth has never felt more refreshed and my teeth have never been this brilliant with little effort on my part.
I will purchase this product again. This product is worth the cost and the cost is comparable to other like items.
Don't know if I love the taste of it, but it seems to work good. I wouldn't pay the extra cost for it though.
Bubbley ,Tingly ,Clean and refreashing .Thanks Crest a great product
I absolutly love Crest. My mouth felt clean after and throughout the day.
This product is great! My teeth feel so clear after I brush and I love the flavor. I highly recommend it!
Love that clean mouth feeling from the toothpaste. And it lasts!
I enjoy using this product...You have fresh breath for a pretty long time...In addition, my teeth feel very smooth and clean after using it. This product is minty but not at all overpowering. Thank you VocalPoint for your wonderful program. It has allowed me to try products that I may not have known about.
I liked the toothpaste. I am a picky toothpaste user and this didn't make me gag like most of the others do. I would recommend it
I really like the flavor of this toothpaste. It makes your teeth feel really clean and it tastes pleasant.
My husband and I really like these products, especially the strength of the flavor and ability to last long into the day. We will continue to buy these.
After using the Crest Complete my breath was fresh and my teeth felt clean. I have had recent sinus issues that have caused bad breath. This product helped with that issue for longer than others I have tried!!
Loved using this product for the first time and it won't be the last.
Made my mouth and teeth feel wonderful. Clean and great tasting, too!
I loved Crest. A great brand name with a great product!.
I found the Crest Complete to be an excellent product. It left my teeth noticeably whiter, without increasing their sensitivity. It also provided lasting freshness as opposed to some products that have an initial fresh taste and then quickly fade. I plan on switching to this product permanently.
Dental care is a commitment - it's not simply a matter of brushing your teeth once a day and you're good to go. And taking care of your teeth and gums has been known to help prevent other health issues, such as heart problems. The Crest Complete system works together (as a system should) to keep your gums and teeth healthy ... and happy! We liked the flavor and having healthy teeth made it easy to keep them in shape. Highly recommend it!
I have used a few of the other Crest Complete toothpastes but this new one is my favorite! The taste is great and it leaves my mouth feeling fresh for quite a while afterwards. I already looked for it to buy more in the store but didn't see it yet. Definitely recommend!
Made my mouth really fresh, but did bubble up a lot.
I really like the way that my mouth feels fresh after I brush my teeth with Crest. With Crest Pro-Health my teeth feel squeaky clean and all around my gums and mouth feel great with that harsh medicine like aftertaste.
Very intense but also very effective. I would definitely recommend to adults.
This tooth paste was wonderful. It left my mouth feeling really clean and it tasted great. It wasn't overpowering and it made my teeth sparkle. I really liked it!
The Crest ProHealth line is wonderful and my mouth always feels clean after I use it. I know I can trust the Crest brand to take care of all my dental health.
i loved this product! it works great and does what it claims!
My mouth feels fresh and clean after every use no matter what I eat.
Leaves your mouth feeling fresh! You know your teeth are clean after using this.
I really love the latest line up of crest. It out performs the others one. Make my teeth look great and my family loves it
It taste good and doesnt have that alcohol aftertaste.
Love this toothpaste! The flavor is not overwehlming like some and it leaves my teeth feeling nice and clean!
Loved the toothpaste. Once we tried it we know this would be our new favorite!!
I have always loved crest and use it consistently. This is my go-to toothpaste, for sure. The value is great. Would definitely recommend to anyone who is interested in a toothpaste brand.
I really like the feel and taste of the toothpaste. My mouth feels clean and fresh after brushing.
Great experience with this brand. I have nothing bad to say about it!
I love the products , they work perfect , the toothpaste and mouth rinse are the only brand that i use
This gave myself as well as my family members that used it a clean feeling all day long.
I have always liked Crest products and this was no different! Crest products have always worked well for me and this one did not disappoint either. My teeth felt clean and looked great!
Although the taste was minty fresh, I didn't feel as though my teeth were as clean as when I used other major brands.
I loved the fresh taste it leaves at the end and also the cleanliness feeling afterwords.
I love this toothpaste! Not only the taste but the after effects. My teeth felt so clean after and the freshness lasted for a while through breakfast and even overnight. I highly recommend
Only toothpaste we use! Finally a toothpaste that lives up to it's name!!
The only toothpaste and mouth rinse we use in my house, I love it!!!!
I really enjoy the feeling I got once I started using Crest complete. I have a brown spot from high fevers at the very top of my gum line and really helps to whiten that up.Thanks for the chance to try this product.
I love this toothpaste. It has a great minty flavor that lasts. Crest Complete cleaned my teeth the best out of all the toothpastes I've tried over the years. It is a little pricey at a retail store, but well worth it for the quality you get.
I loved how clean and fresh my mouth felt after using this toothpaste! It was very refreshing!!!
I love Crest and this one has a great taste and keep my mouth minty fresh and my teeth smooth all day.
Toothpaste has a great minty taste that leaves your mouth feeling fresh for quite some time. Does exactly what I expected it to. Great product.
loved the way it taste and cleans comparable to colgate total
It's all about having a Crest mouth. We only use Crest products here and it shows in our beautiful bright white, clean and healthy smiles. Brushing your teeth for 2 minutes 3 times a day and flossing every day using Crest products helps keep a healthy mouth PLUS a beautiful healthy smile.
I don't really care for the taste of most toothpastes but this one was okay. I really like how it makes my teeth feel after brushing: clean and fresh. Also, I drink a lot of coffee and tea and this does seem to help keep my teeth whiter than any other toothpaste would.
smell so good fresh love it crest always good product
Just like with any Crest product I've used, this one kept my teeth feeling clean and tasted really fresh and not too pasty. I would definitely recommend it.
Had a fresh feeling and felt a difference with the use of this product with my electric toothbrush
Pleasant taste/flavor. I prefer it over any other brands
Love this toothpaste-- it's my new favorite. Love the minty flavor which doesn't burn my mouth. Also love the design of the bottle-- makes me smile in the morningbecuause it's so cheerful. : )
Works great and leaves my teeth feeling clean and fresh.
I've always preferred Crest over Colgate, any day! This product makes you feel clean for hours even after eating and drinking things. The first toothpaste I can say that actually makes my mouth feel good, even after I rinse!
It not only makes my teeth whiter,but it tastes great along with making my gums not bleed after using it. I love the way my mouth tastes after using this toothpaste along with how much nicer my breath and gums are starting to look and feel after using this product. I will continue to use this product!
I love Crest, always have and this product is fantastic! The newest products really make my teeth feel clean all day - and my teeth are whiter than they have been in a long time, even after drinking many cups of coffee! Highly recommend!!
This toothpaste leaves a fresh, clean taste in your mouth. It foams and gives a deep cleaning between teeth.
Not my favorite but was pleasant to use made teeth feel relatively clean. Only drawback was I Felt flavor too strong and spicy. burned tongue
A must use!!! Never had healthier looking teeth and gums before! I recommend everyone tries it!
After the very first use my mouth and teeth felt great. It felt clean and fresh. Even my gums felt healthier after a few uses
THE BEST TOOTHPASTE I'VE TRIED. KEPT MY MOUTH FEELING CLEAN. GREAT TASTE. MY FAMILY LOVES IT
Crest is by far the best and I will keep recommending it to friends and family.
I reallly like the toothpaste. My mouth feels clean and refreshed. I will recommend to my friends and family.
This made my teeth feel amazing!!!!!!!!! I have found a new toothpaste
crest is a must in our house. i love it. i was raised on crest.
MY TEETH FELT SO CLEAN, LOVE THE TASTE. I LOVED IT.
Made my teeth feel nice and clean. The taste was good too not overly minty.
Love the crest clinical toothbrush! Best toothbrush I've ever used.
The crest pro health works very good, and leaves a fresh and clean taste in my mouth.
I loved how clean this made my teeth feel. My kids loved the flavor also!
I tried the new Crest and i have to say i have always been a Crest toothpaste girl so i was not let down. It whittened and freshened my breath and works will. I reccommed it to others.
I really liked the taste. It stays for a long time too which is great. My teeth still felt fresh after eating too.
I really enjoyed the sample of Crest, it left me feeling clean and refreshed for at least 4 hours. That is pretty awesome!
great product for any time of the day, I will be purchasing on Crest toothpaste pro glide lines
I like the way it makes my mouth feel clean and fresh after brushing :-)
I tend to brush a lot because the minty flavor didn't last and my mouth did not feel clean. After trying the new Crest Complete I don't have too brush as much and my mouth feels so clean and refresh...
I really liked this toothpaste. It left my mouth feeling very clean and fresh and the feeling lasted for hours.
I liked this toothpaste a lot. It left my mouth feeling very clean. I am not a big fan of gels, and my store only had it as a gel. I'm not sure if they make one that's just a paste. But that's personal preference. And for a gel, it was great!
Love how the toothpaste made my teeth feel after using ... I will by this again and recomend to fam & friends..
I tried the toothpaste and the rinse. Both left my mouth tingly fresh for hours.
I have always used Crest, but the Crest Complete was like an explosion of freshness in my mouth. Loved it
I like the clean feel in my mouth and teeth, will be adding this to the shopping list.
I really liked this toothpaste. It made my mouth seemingly fresher than the paste I was using before. Thats most important to me!
I find myself brushing more often, because I love the taste. But I didn't notice my teeth getting whiter. I've used Crest products for years, and will continue to do so.
I liked the taste of the toothpaste. It didn't leave a bad baking soda-esque after taste like a lot of whiting pastes do. Unfortunately, I didn't really notice my teeth becoming any whiter with 2 weeks of use. I'd buy it again, but I wouldn't go out of my way to get it if I didn't have a coupon or anything.I did like the Glide floss. I usually use the little floss tooth pick things instead of traditional floss, but I found this was easy to use and effective.I haven't tried to mouthwash yet.
I just tried Crest Complete toothpaste. It has a minty flavor, but I don't like the taste and feel of the product. The mint flavor is "dull" not refreshing, and the toothpaste feels somewhat chalky.I prefer Colgate's MaxWhite or MaxFresh, and Rembrandt's mint Intense Stain. My mouth feels fresher when I use these products.
All my dental projects come from Crest they leave you mouth fresh and clean. Along with the Oral B tooth brush I always kiss clean :*)
I only purchase Crest products for my family's dental health. We were not disappointed by the Crest complete Multi-Benefit Deep Clean toothpaste. There's a tingly feeling as you are brushing that lets you know the product is working. I also think this toothpaste gives you fresher breath than conventional Crest.
I think my mouth might have felt cleaner with a stronger mint flavor, although it really has nothing to do with the cleanliness of your teeth and gums.
It's toothpaste - and it's good. I couldn't say spectacular, but I like it.
I can honestly say that the very first time I tried it I noticed my teeth felt cleaner and smoother. The taste was a pleasant minty flavor. Having used this product for 2 weeks now I would highly recommend it .
For some reason my Husband & I experience a large amt of plaque build-up, esp. during the night. After using the new toothpaste AND the Crest Rinse it seemed like I had less build-up - I also love the fact that the rinse doesn't have that "Stinging" sensation so many other rinses have. All-in-all we think it's a HIT!!!!
I really loved the clean feeling on my teeth after using this toothpaste!I didn't get this from vp, but just bought n loved it!! I have my mom hooked on it too!! One of the best!!
i loved the taste and polish quality of this toothpaste.
Leaves your teeth and mouth feeling clean and fresh
Fantastic, Crest has always been a leader, clean and fresh for hours!
I really liked it and will recommend it to all my friends and family.
My mouth had that just leaving the dentist fresh feeling. This is not your average tooth paste. I highly recommend it even my husband liked it!
My teeth felt very clean long after I brushed this morning, and it did not feel dry. Which is important for me.
This product works very well. My kids even like it, and that is difficult to do! It does what it says it will do and i like the taste
Very good flavor ... not too strong and my teeth felt so clean!
I used the Glide floss, Oral-B toothbrush, and Crest Plaque Control toothpaste. My teeth felt like they do when I leave the dentists office - I couldn't feel or plaque anywhere. My mouth still felt fresh this morning.
I liked the toothpaste because my mouth felt so clean and refreshed.I sometimes don't get that with other toothpaste.
I WOULD VERY MUCH RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT ON A DAILY BASIS
My mouth feel fresh and health. I love the feeling. I would recommeded to friends and family. The freshness last and bright to.
It made my teeth feel really clean, just like I left the dentist office. My breathe was minty fresh.
I love crest product they do just what they say they will do.
I like the clean feel in my mouth and teeth. The smell is great, too.
Crest ProHealth rinse is great, especially no alcohol in it. We have used another famous brand for a long time, but no longer. Crest keeps breath fresh and makes your mouth feel really clean. Have not tried the toothpaste or floss yet, but we will soon and I'm sure they will be just as great as this rinse.
Love the nice minty taste and it makes your mouth and teeth feel so fresh and clean. Nice that it has a team of products to work together too.
I love the crest prohealth products. The taste is great and they leave your mouth and teeth clean and fresh feeling.
it made my teeth feel really clean, nice minty flavor.
My family really like the product and we look forward to buying it in years to come! Great product!YCHShaker Heights Ohio 44120
It makes your whole mouth feel cleaner all day long and helps you keep better breath through out the day. It felt refreshing and it lasted longer than other products I have tried.
I am not really picky about my toothpaste any Crest product will usually do, but I especially liked the crest complete. It has a great minty flavor and left my teeth feeling clean and bright.
I LOVE THE NEW CREST COMPLETE COLLECTION. IT FOAMS IN MY MOUTH AND GETS EVERY CRACK AND CREVICE LEAVING MY MOUTH FEELING BRAND NEW. THE MOUTHWASH TASTES GREAT AND ITS NOT TOO SPICY FOR ME. I DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS BRAND AND THESE NEW PRODUCTS BY CREST. GIVE IT A TRY TODAY!!!
Makes your teeth feel refreshed! Keeps the teeth clean!
This product works great at getting your teeth clean and helping you to have fresh breath for hours after brushing and rinsing with the mouth wash.
I love this product. This toothpaste has a very subtle gritty texture to it. It does something funny to my tongue and it isn't overwhelmingly refreshing
My family enjoys Crest Complete! Clean mouth and fresh breath! I've found our new family favorite!
It was so minty fresh it made my teeth feel so smooth and clean after brushing and that feeling continued throughout the day!
This is the Best Crest toothpaste to date. My teeth feel dentist clean all day. I won't switch until Crest makes something better....but I'm not sure they could top this. Thank you.
It made my teeth feel really clean and it appears whiter. I enjoyed using it.
I loved the way it made my teeth feel and my breathe was so minty
I have used Crest since I was a small child and have 1 cavity and a hygenist who says my teeth are cleaner then hers. I have used just about every product Crest has put on the market in the past 40 years and I find they get better and better. So when I need complete cleaning I know I can count on Crest.
I loved this product. It made my mouth and teeth very clean. Highly recommended by my dentist and dental hygienist.
this is differently a compelet care for my teeth or mouth for the future.
Crest Complete is tremendous! It rocks. My husband and I won't use anything else. It cleans your teeth and keeps your breath fresh most of the day! We love it!!!!
I tried to toothpaste and I liked that my teeth actually felt smooth and clean. The only thing I didn't like was that there was not minty after finishing brushing my teeth. I like for my mouth to keep feeling minty when I'm done, so I felt like something was missing. If you're not too big on a minty aftertaste, you'll love this paste.
I tried the toothpaste and found that it really seemed to really clean my teeth.
i really enjoyed using this product as i felt it was really cleaning my teeth. It also gave me a sense of pride knowing my teeth were the whitest its been in a longtime
Works very well, very noticeably better than average toothpaste. Loved the fresh foaming action
I used all the time . that why i need to fresh breath more longer than less . Its easy for deep clean my teeth .
This was a great toothpaste. It had a good flavor & left my teeth feeling very clean!
obits lady move over... this product really delivers on dirty mouth clean it.... complete. This product has a tool for each job and if i could post it on angies list as reliable i would because the job got done and i was very pleased in the short amount of time it took to get results.
I love this toothpaste. After I used it, it really made my mouth feel fresh and clean.
i loved the overall feeling after using it- great taste and my mouth felt very clean.
Just love the tooth paste it makes my breath feel very fresh and last a long time.
Love this product. My teeth and gums feel amazing after using. I actually feel like my mouth is clean and stays clean until the next brushing.
Love the packaging no big messes. Did the job well and I felt fresh the whole day.
I was a Crest fan already, but Crest Complete is Crest at it's best. My teeth felt cleaner and my breath smelled fantastic!
We liked the way the toothpaste tasted. And it feels like your teeth are really clean
Crest Complete is amazing! I received this as sample and made the switch. I love the way it tastes and leaves my breath smelling minty for hrs. I rub my finger across my teeth after brushing and can hear the clean squeakiness sound. I use it before bed and wake up with my teeth feeling clean.
I tried the Crest Pro Health Plaque rinse with my family.Everyone likes the taste and so far it seems to be working. We have had one family dental appointment with very good results. No cavities and very little plaque.
The Crest Complete did a good job and tasted fine. I, personally, prefer a stronger mint flavor but I know that is not for everybody.
I am pro-active about my family's dental care. This is another in the line of defense. I find it cleans very well with a slight abraisive paste. Recommend? Yes.
I love this toothpaste. It was refreshing and foamy and made my mouth feel very clean! It is good stuff.
Love it!!! Very refreshing leaves teeth, gums and mouth feeling fresh for hours!!!!
This product gets my teeth clean and taste great too!
I loved the feel this product left in my mouth. I would like it to feel a little bit stronger and last longer. But overall it was great. A clean and fresh sense and a great value would definitely buy it again.

I think at least some of the cost goes to the licenses. It does seem like the licensed sets have less bricks for the buck, although that's anecdotal.

I can also recommend Plants vs Zombies and the Traveller's Tales  games as being good fun, the former particularly if you take turns each level with the other on "lookout" duty.
I haven't played any of the newer ones, but out of the three  games I've played,  Star Wars: The Complete Saga was the most fun. Easy achievements, fun co-op with a friend, and decent slap-stick humor. Oh yeah, and breaking Jar-Jar over and over again was very satisfying.

 PhoncipleBone: Depends on how many small bricks they use. I hope it is more in line price wise with Orthanc or R2D2 than it is the SSD or B-Wing. There seems to be a UCS-tax, and I am thinking/hoping that this set avoids that, since it is not UCS.

 specific minifig, ebauy or some other buyer is the way to go. When the series is still on sale, you normally only pay a 20-30% markup, then prices rise when the series stops.
