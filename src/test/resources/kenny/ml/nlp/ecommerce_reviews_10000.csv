5.00,"Excellent quality product, I just can't wait for a less expensive generic that performs the same. So far, I haven't found one to compare and this is a little pricey."
5.00,"I absolutely LOVE this stuff. I use it mostly for my sheets, towels and comforters. You can use as much or as little as you want and it just smells wonderful. You walk in your bedroom and it just smells clean! What a great invention! I always buy when I see it on sale! Try it! I think you will love it!"
5.00,"I was used to adding fabrick softeners when the beep went off for a final rinse. Sometime that really got in the way or simply forgot to. Not any more. These downy unstopables are simply adorable and convenient. My work out clothes now really smell fresh as are the towels and bed sheets."
5.00,"I put these inside a new vacuum bag and it made the whole house smell wonderful! I was out of vac. tablets and thought I\"d try this -it works great! it was only about a quarter size of the cap-viola!"
5.00,"I use this for my sheets and towels!! The scent is fresh and lasts for days. My husband likes it too!"
5.00,"Downy smells are awesome. I love this one too. Fun new product to try, I throw it in with my towels, it helps give them the extra boost of sweet smelling clean, that they need."
3.00,"Well, I gave it three stars because it does what it says it does, but I didn't like it at all. To be honest I don't even like perfumes, so I was afraid this stuff would be too strong smelling for me. I love my Downy Fabric Softener and the soft scent it gives my cloths; but this stuff is way too strong for me, even with a little. I saw someone else mention that it makes the towels feel to rough and I totally agree. I really like my towels soft. I usually only use a tad of softener and it's enough to make my towels soft and smell nice without taking away the ability to absorb. But I used twice as much softener because of what I read and I still didn't like the feel of my towels either. I didn't notice it as much on my cloths.                                              If you like the extra scent, this will give you what you're looking for. But it's not for those, like myself, that don't like strong, perfumey smells."
5.00,"My boyfriend is a Hockey Goalie and of course sweats and reaks after his games. This stuff was absolutely amazing with the scent and also stayed smelling good for a while."
4.00,"I bought the Gain version but decided to try these, there is no difference between the two, they both make your clothes smell good. There needs to be a bigger container for these because I use them a lot. They work well for clothes that you work out in."
5.00,"I use this in the wash along with Downey Infusions Honey Flower fabric softner - our laundry smells so good for so long, wish they'd make this scent as a dryer sheet."
5.00,"These unstopables get rid of all the smells on laundry. It works like magic. I wish they were less expensive but they work amazing."
5.00,"The scent last for a long time. This is my favorite of all the unstoppables. Definately purchase again and again."
5.00,"My wife and I both have sensitive skin, so we're forced to use unscented, hypoallergenic detergents for our laundry. Unfortunately, we're both very active, and the freshness of our clothing suffers for it. This product is the perfect answer to our needs. It doesn't take a lot to freshen up a load of laundry, and we haven't had any skin irritation as a result of using it. I highly recommend it!"
4.00,"So easy to use and leaves laundry smelling fresh. Not like some fresheners that smell like cheap perfume. This scent is fabulous! Only negative is product is a bit pricey."
5.00,"I have these on subscribe and save, very good for things like blankets that are not washed very frequently, freshness lasts"
5.00,"I have been looking for something to get the smell out of my Grandsons work clothes .                                              He is a chef. I have tried baking soda, vinigar, and Oxy clean,just to name a few, with out much success.                                                But the Downy Wash scent booster, really worked.                                                                     I use my regular tide with bleach, or Gain -love the Gain), and throw a few pellets in with the beginning wash.                                              Its easy, and I do not measure anything.                                              I still use my dryer sheets,which gives a scent, but I use them so I do not have to iron!                                                                     Even using dryer sheets with the other cleaners, just never got that resturant cooking smell out of his clothes.                                                                     These are little round thin pellets.                                              This seemed expensive but you do not have to use many pellets. Maybe 15 or so.                                                                     I also use this on my clothes and my Husbands with out a problem.                                              The scent stays in the clothes, but it is NOT strong. A nice fresh clean scent.                                                                     I will be buying more.Two thumbs up."
3.00,"These smell great and are convenient because you add them at the beginning of the wash. HOWEVER the beads DO NOT DISSOLVE IN COLD WASHES. After ordering i ended up finding them at the supermarket for a much cheaper price."
4.00,"I love these Unstopables, just wish they were a little less pricey (reason for the 4 stars). Love how they make my laundry smell. I also use regular Downy, may be a little Downy freak, but the scent boosters really add a nice scent. I have tried all 3 scents & love them all. Use different ones for different pieces of laundry."
5.00,"Smells amazing! Love love love this product. Will continue to buy in the future. The smell is incredible and leaves clothes smelling great all day."
3.00,"I had seen this product advertised, and when Amazon made it available through the Vine program, I decided to give it a try. Just a word here: this product does nothing else other than to provide a scent to your laundry. It does not provide extra cleaning power or softening. So, if you - like me - use an additional cleaner to your laundry detergent, you will need to continue to use that product and this. Likewise, if you use a softening product in the wash, you will need to continue to use that as well as using this product. Considering that a person might have to use a laundry detergent, an extra cleaner (such as Oxi-clean, Clorax 2, or bleach), in wash softening rinse, AND this? It just seems like a LOT of products to be putting into the washing machine. It just seems to me it would be more logical if this product combined with some of the others: scent booster along with softening or extra cleaner/whitener/brightener. I could feel as though I'm being economical in some way - and not having to carry additional bottles to the laundry room each week!                                                                     There is no set amount one must use. I suppose this can be good or bad, it's up to the individual. One of the first loads of laundry I tried with this product, I put in a full capful, and the laundry's scent WAS boosted. Oh my, yes! The entire closet was scented from just the few items I had washed! So, caution on using a lot of this product, especially if one is very sensitive to smells. Oh, and the scent does last for a while. Quite a while.                                                                     And speaking of scent, I found a mixed bag result when I lessened the amount of this product and used it with my laundry detergent (which has its own scent) and my in-wash detergent booster (which is also slightly scented), and the Bounce sheets that I use - which are also scented. It seems that none of the scents really came through clearly. Which is probably a good thing! And that is another confusing aspect of this product. Unless one uses all laundry products that have no perfumes, normally all laundrey products have some sort of scent. And those scents don't seem to \"gel\" with this as well - unless you use A LOT of this product, and it becomes overwhelming.                                                                     I had never looked at the price of this product until I received this as an Amazon Vine product to sample. I personally find the price prohibitive, especially as this product only provides a scent and does nothing towards cleaning or softening. I have found coupons for this product, but for only $1 off, which is still way more than this budget shopper can afford. If this product did more than simply scent the laundry, I might be able to make a justification for the added expense, but for now? No, I cannot. Not in these times.                                                                     Even if this product were cheaper, and I were more inclined to purchase it in the future, I would probably use it exclusively for my towels and sheets. Personally, I found the scent too overwhelming for me, with concerns about it clashing with my perfumes (yes, it can be that strong). As to my husband? He really didn't have anything to say, but it's not really a scent a man would enjoy emanating from the shirts he wears when he hangs with his buds.                                                                     I would consider this a slightly luxary item, and if you can afford it and don't mind an extra bottle in your laundry room and like the scent, go for it! I didn't hate the product, and it certainly lived up to what it was supposed to do. I just found it expensive, cumbersome, a bit overwhelming, and sort of something along the lines of a 5th wheel."
5.00,"You sprinkle it in your wash before washing and your clothes smell so good.  I love the smell of fresh clean laundry and this product does the trick everytime!"
5.00,"Our clothes come out smelling wonderful! I use it at every wash to keep towels, bedding & clothes smelling great!"
5.00,"Love it  Love it  Love it!!!  The smell is phenominal!  The smell is definately stronget in the bottle than when the clothes come out of the washer.  I love how my clothes and sheets hold the smell for several days.  I love to walk into my bedroom and it smells so clean and fresh!  I would recommend this product to ALL and I am even having to come here to buy it because I can't find it in the stores anymore  :/"
4.00,"I came to Amazon so I can order Downy Unstopables thinking they would be cheaper (and I go through 2 bottles a week) and see that it costs at least $4 more here than in the store...great stuff but too expensive on Amazon!"
2.00,"I was excited about the Lush scent after purchasing a bottle of the Fresh scent at the store. I can not smell this one like I can the Fresh and I am dissapointed as I was hoping for a lovely lavender-type scent. I tried using more, no luck. I can't really tell if it softens my clothes much but I know it isn't scenting them and that's too bad. If you want a lasting scent, get the Fresh."
5.00,"Considering the new HE washers use less soap, I thought it would be nice to give my laundry a scent boost. Just add a small capful in the machine before the beginning of the wash cycle and it really makes a difference. Will purchase again!"
5.00,"I love this stuff!  I've used Downy for more than twenty years.  From time to time I will use a different brand--one on sale-- but I always come back to Downy.  Now with there Unstoppables line I'm even more addicted.  I was a bit worried that the little pellets might leave spots or oily stains on my clothes but I've used it now for about seven loads and haven't seen one spot!  It's a bit pricey, (you can get it cheaper at your local grocer than here) but I'm hoping to come across coupons for future purchases.  A tip for everyone--a little goes a long way.  The first time I used almost half a cap full and it was way more than I think you need to leave a fresh scent on your laundry."
5.00,"Smells wonderful!! my clothes smell soo good!"
5.00,"I love the downy unstopables. It just takes very little to get and keep your clothes smelling so so good. The scent will last a long time on your clothes after washing. I have even spinkled a small amount of these in my vacuume cleaner. I just wish the price wasn't so darn high. Even though with the price being high, there still worth buying."
5.00,"Makes my clothing smell incredible for days! Even got my parents hooked on using it instead of the regular downy."
5.00,"I LOVE this product so much. it make my laundry smell so good. Quick tip i learned from pinterest, use it in a oil warmer to make your house smell clean and fresh works great!"
5.00,"I love the product and got an excellent price. I love it, I didn't have to go out to get my favorite products when I can get them from Amazon."
5.00,"These are great to use when washing bed spreads, etc. The light scent stays with the fabric for weeks - I love it!"
5.00,"I usually use a Tide brand detergent, which worked really well with Unstopables. That said I haven't been able to find them around where I live, which happens to also be a major city so that's a little off putting when it comes to a long term buy for me. I have been concerned with what people are saying when they are going through over a pound a week though, the Downy Unstopables are quite strong, and I have just sprinkled maybe 1-2oz in with my laundry, and with my regular detergent it's great. Saying that the consumer should use \"a little or a lot\" is way too open to interpretation and you can waste a lot of your product if you don't know how much will actually still increase the smell. Downy needs to decide at what level they want, because if people are using it so quickly and it's sort of expensive, then people won't actually continue to buy it. I love the scent though, it's great and the fact I can just dump it in my HE washer and not worry is nice. Hope to fine it locally though!"
5.00,"We live in the city and have to use laundromats to clean our clothes. The dryers at these places often use super high heat and even with a dryer sheet my clothes can have a slightly burned smell. We started to use these in the wash and I have never gotten the burned smell again, our clothes come out smelling like fresh laundry again! Highly recommend especially for anyone using a laundromat."
5.00,"It leaves my clothing with a really nice scent. Depending on it will last I will buy it again, cause it's not cheap."
2.00,"I was very excited to use this product, despite reading many reviews that it doesn't leave scent in the clothing when using an HE washer. Should have listened! I was expecting my laundry to come out with a fabulous aroma that would last and last...After going through the washer, there was minimal scent, but after drying there was no scent left. I used a scant amount and moved up to a heaping cap full, with no change. It also seems to dull the effects of my fabric softener, my clothing was coming out of the dryer with a lot of static!"
4.00,"I wash two loads per week, and this product has my gym clothes smelling great...right before I destroy them again. haha What keeps me from giving 5 stars is that the product is a bit expensive to use consistently. I have varied the amounts used, and find that my loads need at least 2/3 of the cap. This can wear the bottle out quickly. I only buy when on sale."
2.00,"I tried a free sample of Downy Unstoppables Blue scent, and it worked remarkably! I absolutely loved it! But when my grocery store didn't start carrying it, I turned online to order some. The blue kind was out of stock, so I bought this kind (purple) instead, thinking it would work just as well. It doesn't! It doesn't seem to matter how much I put in, the scent doesn't last past the dryer. Very disappointing, considering how much it costs and doesn't last more than maybe 10 loads anyway. Don't waste your money on the purple kind, wait until the blue stuff is in stock!"
5.00,"Honestly...My wife made this purchase and I (like most men) thought...\"great, another smelly product...waste of money\"...However, this stuff works great...leaves a really fresh smell that actually lasts...Haha...Imagine that...A product that actually does what it says it does...Go figure...If you're on the fence, buy this...you won't be disappointed. Oh...and I do my own laundry...and not sure how much my wife uses...but I throw almost an entire cap-full in the load...And yes, these are front-loading HE friendly..."
5.00,"My boyfriend and I have been using these for about 3 months and they are amazing. Price is a little high, but we've gotten lucky and P&G has had a coupon in the brandsaver every month. First of all, Tide detergent is all we use, as it works best on his work uniforms and before we started using these, the detergent and fabric softener couldn't take the grill smell (he works in a restaurant) out of his aprons and his clothes smelled like grease the very next day. We don't even need to put much in the washer either. I just fill the blue cap until it's to the bottom mark. Makes a great air freshener too! Just dissolve some in very hot water and pour in a trigger sprayer."
5.00,"This make the clothes smelll amazing..and it really does stay..Did a whole load of towels 4 days ago and you cab still smell the fragance in the towels.. A definte recommend!"
5.00,"everything worked...We have already brought the product from a trip to America to Germany and wanted to have it again. The beads make the clothes a long lasting fresh scent. Shipping and communication with the sender worked fine. Thanks"
5.00,"I was able to try this product through Vocalpoint several weeks ago.                                                                     I love the Fresh Scent.  I love alot of fragrance when doing laundry, and this product definitely makes this chore alot more pleasurable.                                                                     Iam able to use this product instead of using fabric softener even tho it's labeled as a scent booster.  I can always count on Downy to make a great product, and this one  definitely falls into that category.                                                                     I want to try the other scent too.  I just wish it came in a larger size than 13.2 ounces, because I would definitely buy it.                                                                     I really appreciate Vocalpoint allowing me to test this product."
4.00,"Downy Unstopables commercials have been popping up all over. So much so that I've been curious as to whether the fragrance truly is unstoppable. If you've not seen the advertisements, this product is simply a scent booster for your laundry. You can throw in a little or a lot, depending on your preference. At the current price of $11.01, my choice was to use a little. True, Amazon currently has a $2 off coupon and the Lush scent is a buck cheaper, but that's still a steep price to make laundry smell better.                                                                     The fresh scent aroma, which smells absolutely wonderful, can be detected prior to opening up the bottle. Made me want to wash clothes right away. Depending on how much used, one bottle can boost the smell of about ten to twelve loads of clothes. Though the smell diminishes over time, my clothes retained the fragrance after three weeks of being in the closet. The smell would have lasted longer if I'd left them in there.                                                                     My only complaint is the price, but the product can be versatile. Put some in a knee high or tie it up in a fine netting material and you can have an aromatic sachet. It's a good way to make your entire closet smell fresh."
3.00,"It isn't that bad a little bit goes a long way. The unfortunate thing is that im kind of tired of the scent and i still have over half a bottle of it left."
1.00,"Sorry, but this stuff has such a bad smell that I had to wash my cloths again - minus the Unstopables."
5.00,"What can I say I love these things. Kinda addicted to them. My husband even demands that I keep using them. You can walk in the bedrooms and the smell is just awesome. The 2 guestrooms smell great for months and that keeps me from washing linens ever week on beds not used. Your clothes will love you and you will love your clothes. Just one hint don't use detergents or softener with scent and they work better."
2.00,"I have used up a whole bottle of Downy Unstopables. At first I thought it was ok, since it added some extra scent. But honestly, you get that from your laundry detergent and/or fabric softener, so realistically there is no reason to add yet another product and more money to the laundry.The biggest problem I have with it is that it seems like it kills the fabric softener. I have noticed my towels are stiffer and rough. It is worse than not using any fabric softener at all. Even when I don't use softener, my towels are never this rough feeling.I don't use alot of crystals at all either. I use enough to cover the bottom of the lid/cap that you use for dispensing. That is really all you need in order to add a decent amount of scent. So, the roughness is not due to using too much of the Unstopables.My other big complaint is that I can tell a huge difference in the dark loads - they attract more lint and hair. All loads have more static cling as well when using the Unstopables, but the dark loads are terrible.This product just isn't worth it for me in the long run. It adds extra unnecessary cost to the laundry. I do at least 2 loads a day, every day. Most days I have more loads. With 3 teens in sports and cheeleading, laundry is a major part of my day. I do not need it to cost more money. I get a nice amount of scent from the fabric softener and detergent, so I will stick with those and occasional stain pre treaters of course."
5.00,"great smell! I would buy this one again! If I can find it in my local store. I'm anxious to try the other scents."
2.00,"I loved the scent of this, it was on sale & I had a coupon. I'd read reviews about the scent being very strong so used in sparingly in the first load. Nothing. Tried it again and filled the entire cap, as I was doing a big load. Some items had a light pleasant fragrance, others none at all. It seemed that only the all cotton items carried the scent. However it would be far to expensive, in my opinion, to justify using it regularly. And after a few hours, the scent is definitely fading. Oh well! It was fun to try it."
5.00,"tried this on a lark; but now subscribe regularly. It works and so easy I can do the laundry though she really wants me to stay in the kitchen."
4.00,"smells good. although it is my second choice. like to use on curtains and blankets. does last for few days"
5.00,"I work out just about everyday, so needless to say, my workout gear and towels can get a little mildewy and it's so hard to get them smelling fresh. That's why I was excited to discover Downy Unstopables In Wash Fresh Scent Booster.                                                                     First off, this product is so easy to use. Just open, pour as much or as little as you'd like into the cap and toss into your washing machine. If you pour in more, you'll get a stronger scent and if you pour in less, the scent won't be as strong. Frankly, I like that you can control the scent because each load of laundry is different. I love adding extra to towels, bed sheets, and active gear, but only a little to every day clothes. Like other reviewers, I was a bit worried, since what you pour into your washing machine are little tablets or capsules and I was worried that they would not all dissolve. But have no fear. Everything dissolved and I was left with fresh-smelling laundry.                                                                     I've used scented laundry detergent and fabric softener in the past, but the smell never lasts. However, with Downy Unstopables, you'll find your laundry smelling fresh for a really long time. I look forward to trying different scents and definitely recommend."
5.00,"I have 8 sets of sheets for my bed, two sets in each of four colors. I switch colors on the first Saturday of March, June, September, and December. I pulled out the the space bag containing my yellow spring sheets last night, in preparation for putting them on the bed next weekend. When I sealed them up last June I put a couple of dryer sheets in with them in hopes of avoiding that musty smell you get in sheets that have been stored for a long time. That didn't work - yuck! I decided to wash them this weekend with half a cup of baking soda in the wash load, and a cup of white vinegar in the rinse load. That always helps, but never takes the smell away completely. The sheets are made from Tencel (third generation Rayon) so fabric softener isn't necessary, and will actually break down the fibers and shorten the life of the sheets. I was at the grocery store this morning and saw the Downy Unstopables, and thought - I'll give them a try. I bought the Fresh scent because they were available in a smaller size. I have a high efficiency portable top loading machine with no agitator. I had seen a few other people mention that the beads didn't dissolve completely, so I put in half a cap-ful, along with half a cup of baking soda, set the machine to the lowest water level, and then let it start its cycle so that the beads got spun around in the water for a few minutes. This really seemed to help with dissolving the beads. I then paused the machine, reset the water level to the right level for the load, added detergent (Mrs Meyers) and the sheets. I wash the sheets in wash bags so they don't get tangled due to the agitator-less design of my machine. I went back and added a cup of white vinegar to the rinse. The result? No musty smell whatsoever. The sheets smell like the scent of the Unstopables, with no musty smell hiding underneath. They are currently hanging on my indoor clotheslines, and making my apartment smell nice. I can't see using them on my clothes, as they are a bit expensive to use all the time, but for sheets that have been languishing in a closet (or a Space Bag) these will now become a part of my regular routine! My only gripe - why did they misspell unstoppable? Where's the extra P Downy?"
5.00,"This stuff smells great and works very well. I can honestly say that we have linen in the closet that was washed several months ago and it still smells amazing great."
4.00,"Love this scent. I don't really smell it in my clothes after they are hanging in the closet for a few days. Maybe I am not using enough in the washer. But still a very nice scent when they come out of the dryer. Love using this with my whites as it helps mask the smell of bleach that lingers in the clothes."
4.00,"After the purchase of a case of fragrance free fabric softener, this product swooped in and saved the day. The smell is delightful, fresh smell that is not overbearing and lasts three weeks (and still going....). The downfall of the product, like any scented product, is skin irritation from overdoing it. The Unstopables does not have a measuring device other than the lid (no measurement lines on lid) and the directions are \"as little or as much as you'd like\". In order to get the best scent you have to play around with how much your skin can tolerate vs scent strength. Not a deal breaker issue though. One bottle lasted over a month with a household of six"
2.00,"First of all, let me say I was so excited to try this! Who doesn't like good smelling laundry? I love the smell of the \"Fresh Scent\" unstopables.I thought the best way to try this out would be using it on blankets, towels and sheets. In the directions it states \"use as little or as much as you want\" so I decided to try it both ways. I started off using a little amount and thought maybe this was why the smell didn't last very long. Then I used a lot, I was so disappointed, the smell only lasted a couple of days also! My Downy fabric softener lasts longer than this!!! I won't be buying this product again, I will be sticking to my Tide laundry detergent and Downy fabric softener."
5.00,"Had to try these after they somehow were suggested on Amazon. They last quite some time. I use a 'couple shakes' per load, but you can use less or more depending on your needs. They are a little pricey but make your clothes smell lovely. I usually use no dyes or scents since I am sensitive and have found no trouble using the unstoppables. I bought the blue one, not sure what scent it is, but will be buying them again as I am out (after a few monthes). Oh, and it makes sweaty boy clothes smell nice too."
5.00,"I received this as a free sample and loved it so much, I immediately ordered more from Amazon.  Both scents are fantastic and stayed with the fabric until washed.  I love this for stinky teenage clothes, and getting rid of that musty smell that the washer can get in the summer when the kids leave their wet clothes too long.  It's also really nice to make towels, bedding, and bed clothes smell fresh, no matter how long they sit in the drawer or closet before using.  It may be too pretty for some men, but neither of the men in this house have complained.  My only complaint is that I later found that it sells for much less at Target and Walmart.  I wish Amazon would offer a better price as I'd love to use this with every laundry load."
5.00,"Everyone should try this because it makes your clothes smell so awesome. I ahve since found it in the stores as well"
5.00,"I think Downy hit a home run with the unstopable line. Washing towels and sheets with these and then pulling them out weeks later, the smell is still there. This is great, because using fabric softener reduces the absorbant efficacy of towel fibers. Unstopables are scent based only, no softening agent. Glow scent is not overpowering. None of the scents are."
5.00,"I love downy unstoppables but is a little expensive, I use a bottle weekly."
5.00,"These are terrific ,just the easiest to use.My clothes hold the scent for a long time. love them. will continue to buy these"
5.00,"This product is GREAT, makes my whole closet smell soooooo good, I never want to be without it. Friends and strangers are commenting on the fabulous smell and I recommend it happily."
5.00,"This thing is awesome but it works ONLY if you use the right amount, and there seems to be a widespread misconception about what the right amount is. I take exactly half of what the measuring cup can hold and it works AMAZING! I even used this once while the washing machine was filling up with the washing machine lid open, and there happened to be a fan blowing air next to the washing machine (this happened last summer) and in the time it took for the washing machine fill up, the fan blew scented air that left my apartment smelling awesome the whole day. Also, here's one trick I learned online. Take 2 table spoons of this thing and put them inside your vacuum cleaner bag at the time you're installing a new one. When you vacuum, your whole home will smell like this. Saved me from buying the expensive feebreeze branded bags they sell for my vacuum cleaner that don't even work this well. And with the clothes you're washing? Its originally intended purpose? Best product of its kind I have ever used. It's really unstoppable!"
5.00,"I makes my laundry smell good. Easy to use. Good for the wash and do not need dryer sheets with scents."
2.00,"Other than \"unstopables\" not being an actual word, this product has another problem:  who on earth is going to pay a premium - a large premium - for extra perfume for their clothes?  I won't be.                                                                     Basically, this product is a bunch of waxy-feeling granules that you add to your washing machine.  Water breaks it down, releasing its perfume, and there you have it - scented clothes.  It does the job, and the perfume is pleasant-enough smelling.                                                                     But then again, both my detergent and fabric softener also smell fine.  If I use these in combination, I end up with three different perfumes vying for supremacy, leading to a weird concoction of aromas that...shouldn't be.  Remove one (or two) of those perfumes, and the clothes are back to smelling how you figured they were.                                                                     Perhaps if you use unscented detergent and fabric softener (does that even exist?), and use this just because you fell in love with the scent, it would make sense.  In the real world, however, this product doesn't make any sense at all.  And while I received my container of it free of charge, I hope that the list price is actually a 3 or 4 pack, because not only is this nothing special (and an awkward product), but it's also quite expensive.  I won't be buying it or using it again, once this container is used up."
3.00,"i put this in two vacuums we use at home as read about on a blog to eliminate the musty/vacuum aromas. works great for emitting a nice fresh aroma; unfortunately I sneezed a lot. will be looking for someone who can use this product either as intended (if it made be sneeze i will not use it in the laundry)or in vacuum cleaner!"
5.00,"Love this product - it's the only softener that I will buy.  Liquid softeners are bad for my septic system and dryer sheets clog dryer vents.  I've noticed that the smell is very subtle (sometimes hard to detect) until you rub the fabric.  That's when the scent comes out very nicely.  My favorite is the fresh scent (blue) product."
4.00,"This is the best solution if you have stinky water. We use a filter and softener, but our well water is gross. When I have to hang dry clothes, they get this horrible egg water odor. Using this is the only solution that works. It's a miracle. And it's so much cheaper to buy them on Amazon rather than the store."
5.00,"Honestly, I thought these were a big waste of money when my husband brought them home...I mean, we already use Downey...so, I thought we did not need. Ha, ha, ha...now I'm the one adding them to the cart. They smell great and leave a nice scent a bit longer than softener."
1.00,"This toxic product scored an F on EWG.ORG stating HIGHEST CONCERN. Potentially significant hazards to health or the environment. Please do your research before exposing yourself and your family to this product."
5.00,"You should not have to filled this stupid box out. Thanks in advance for removing this stupid and senseless requirements!"
5.00,"I have a very musty house with pretty bad airflow. this helps to keep my clothes fresher smelling for a longer amount of time."
5.00,"love, love, love this stuff. it makes laundry smell really fresh. i love curling up in my comforter or using towels right out of the shower after doing laundry. one capful into the washing machine works for a full load. you can put the beads in at the beginning of the load (no more waiting for the washer to tell you its time for softener, or goocking up your washing machine in teh softener slot), and when water goes into the machine, the beads dissolve easily - I have never had any residue from these beads. I still use the dryer sheets occasionally but you dont need to with these. the scent is great - not overpowering, it is the light and fresh."
3.00,"I saw this and decided to try it out since my clothes never seem to have that fresh scent from ether the laundry detergent OR fabric softeners. I was a bit skeptical at first, but I do have to admit, this works. I actually had a couple co-workers comment on the \"fabric softener\" I was using.                                                                     That being said, WHY can't there be a laundry detergent or softener that delivers this? Why should we have to pay for yet another item to deliver that fresh laundered scent? And why must it be so darned expensive? I find to get my clothes to the scent I want, I have to use about half a capful of the Unstoppables, and if I want all my clothes to have this fresh scent, this doesn't last very long.                                                                     Bottom line; yes it works and well, and if you have the money to spend on it it's perfect but I can't justify the price for the performance. If I use this I will use it for certain items of clothing. In the mean time, the search continues for a laundry detergent or softener that delivers what it promises instead of having to shell out the $ for a separate product."
3.00,"this is ok but pretty pricey I love the smell but it is hard at times to use sometimes if you are in a hurry and you use to much and wow does the smell lingers it is not bad but to much is to much would buy it but just to expensive"
5.00,"Wow super fresh smell. I love this item!"
5.00,"Makes my laundry smell great! Even after two weeks in the drawer, they come out as fresh as when they went in."
5.00,"I take care of my mom who had a stroke and is incotinent, with these I don't have that bleach and pee smell that I was getting. Now I can use a little bit of bleach to disinfect and the clothes come out smelling wonderful."
5.00,"This washing scent booster is great. I find it leaves all my clothes smelling so much better. I use it for every load. Other companies have such a product, but are much more expensive. The scent is there and it's great. Highly recommend this over the other brands which are so much more expensive."
2.00,"I've been using this for weeks now, switching from the purple to the blue. It smells wonderful in the wash, but I don't find the scent to be lasting much after the dryer except on towels. I would expect my entire closet should be wafting with the wonderful scent by now, having washed nearly all my clothing in it, but alas. . . no. I had hoped my bed linens would retain the scent after making the bed, but by the time I climb into bed. . . not so much and certainly nothing after a day or so. Over priced and over-rated in my opinion and just a gimmicky thing. Perhaps if my washer and dryer were on the main floor, I would have the added benefit of fragrancing my home as I did the wash, but unfortunately, they're in the basement. Very disappointed. Will have to try the Gain product."
5.00,"I love to add these to my laundry to add a subtle scent to my clothes and towels. If I add more than just the bottom of the cap, it's too strong and makes me sneeze."
3.00,"works fine used for bedding, smells great but for clothing,scent did not linger at all,ill stick to my downey liguid.thanks I lov walmart!!!!!!!!!!!"
4.00,"I bought these solely to enhance the smell of my awful dog beds when I was them- I feel no amount of a fabric softener (liquid or sheets) compares to these bad boys. Also does wonders to my normal laundry."
5.00,"I absolutely love these Downy Unstopables. It keeps my clothes so fresh smelling for weeks. I will always use and enjoy this product."
5.00,"I have hard water that sometimes smells like blood. Iron. Gotta love it. This stuff makes everything smell nice and clean and lasts, too! When my friends run out, they come to me begging for a cap full. Its just that good!"
5.00,"IT WORKS GREAT.I STARTED WITH A VERY SMALL AMOUNT,I HAVE VERY SENSITIVE SKIN.NO ITCH,NO RASH,CLOTHES SMELL GREAT,EVEN FROM THE FRONT LOADER...LOVE THIS STUFF !! I WILL GET MORE"
3.00,"I like the smell, very light floral scent. After a load is washed it leaves a nice light scent on the clothes, but doesn't seem to last very long. But the price for this seems a little high."
5.00,"I have tried every different brand of these scent shaky thingies and this is definitely The Best. Last the longest and smells delic!"
5.00,"I fell in love with this product. Our clothes smell so amazing all day long and the Fresh scent is so crisp."
5.00,"What can I say, I absolutely LOVE this product. Recieved a sample in the mail and it sat there for about four months. My friend told me how much she loved using the product(although quite pricey). I used my sample on the next load and my laundry room even smelled wonderful. With three boys and a husband in construction, the laundry can get pretty stinky. Using this, it literally takes all that stink and funky smell away from the clothes! Even a few guys at work said that my husbands' shirt smelled good, much to his embarassment. =) Only down side is the price. =("
5.00,"This is a Great Product, no need for softening sheets in the Dryer and the convenience of putting it in before the wash is awesome......But the Fresh Sent just last forever, I'm Really Impressed! :)"
5.00,"I am obsessed with this stuff!! It seriously makes the clothes smell SO amazing!! And for a LONG time!! I refuse to wash my clothes without it. And as much as I LOVE Gain the Downy Unstoppables work MUCH better!! And I even tested out the crystals and they PALE in comparison!!"
5.00,"the unstopables work great and have a real good smell. the scent does hold up. i put some in a spray bottle and spray it on my bedding an also in my car smells great. thanks jw"
3.00,"Downy Unstopables are ok, they do leave a nice scent in your laundry without the use of softener. For me it was just another item I have to remember to add to the wash and I keep forgetting it, plus it just does not leave enough of a scent that lasts."
4.00,"I haven't used this product with my normal laundry load, but I have used it with bathroom rugs and towels. In each load I used a full cap, and each load smelled noticeably better. However, the scent was gone within 3-4 days of sitting in the guest linens closet."
5.00,"I've been using this product for at least a year now, and I love it. I don't have to use much at all, and I still end up with wonderful smelling clothes. I used a quarter cap full in the load with my uniforms and the scent is still going strong. I can smell it when I open drawers to grab a shirt, and I can still smell it on the shirt at the end of the day. I normally get this at the commissary back home, but being on deployment, this is one of the only ways to get Unstopables. I know there were some reviews about it being cheaper at Walmart, but for some of us there is no Walmart or Publix for thousands of miles. My one and only complaint is about how long it took for Amazon to fulfill the order. I ordered it on 19Dec, and they shipped it at the beginning of January. Also, there have been reviews that you have to use non scented detergent or fabric softener for the scent of the Unstopables to shine through. I never had an issue when I used scented detergent, and I still have no issue now that I'm using home made detergent. And I use vinegar as a fabric softener now, and it doesn't affect this stuff at all."
4.00,"Unstoppable are a splurge I allow myself. The extra smell for clothing is more of a want than I need. Fresh is my favorite scent. Shimmer and Glow follow in second place."
3.00,"I started using this product when I was given a coupon for it at a convention that I attended a few years ago. I LOVED the idea of it and, of course, in the samples that they showed me at the convention of \"30 day old\" scraps of cloth that had been washed with the Downy Unstopables they smelled like heaven! I really liked the idea of my laundry smelling like it had just come out of the dryer for weeks after it was washed (particularly my bedding and towels). However, while my laundry DOES come out smelling fantastic right after it is washed it does NOT (in my opinion) retain very much smell for even a few days after - let alone weeks. I have continued to use this product hoping that I would get a better result from my new HE washer, or a different scent but so far I have been underwhelmed. In fact, I recently switched from store-brand to name-brand dryer sheets and have been more impressed with the scent of those than the Unstopables. I am going to try some of the other options that are now on the market by other companies to see how they perform. I will also mention that I have had a few issues with the beads not dissolving in the wash and ending up in my dryer (which is a nightmare to clean up when they melt in there). It only seems to happen when I wash bedding (like it gets caught up inside of the sheets/blankets/whatever). Most of the time it is fine, but it has happened. Overall, I am considering giving up on the Unstopables. I love the IDEA of them, but in reality? Not so much."
5.00,"Addicting! I ran out of this recently and found myself not wanting to do any more loads until I ordered a replacement."
5.00,"Works great for all the wash that you need and makes them it smell a lot better than without it."
2.00,"I added 1 capfull in my first load and 2 capfuls in my second load and I really can't say it does any better than my laundry soap and dryer sheets. How many capfuls or how much do I have to use to make it work???"
5.00,"I absolutely love the smell of Downey unstopables, this is a New scent and its just as great smelling as the others your clothes will feel soft and smell fresh for weeks."
5.00,"This is simply the best! just add a little or add a whole cap full for clothes that smell nice for extended time after washing. Very good value for price."
5.00,"I can't say enough about how much I love this product! I will never let myself run out of it!"
5.00,"I use an unscented laundry detergent for most my clothes since I don't like the extra scents when I'm wearing my freshly washed clothes.  The downside of using unscented detergent is that after a few years of use, my towels and bedding (which I don't mind having a scent) have retained an old musty smell that I can't get rid of no matter how many times I wash.  I've tried strongly scented dryer sheets and fabric softeners for my towels and bedding, but nothing really worked.  THIS did the trick.  I just poured in a quick shake with my bedding and towels load and when they came out they smelled great!                                                                     A little goes a long way too - since the scent beads were colored, I was worried I'd get spots on my light colored load so I only put in about a teaspoon full, but the smell was still great.  This has become a staple in my laundry arsenal."
5.00,"Downy Unstopables is a fabulous product. In fact, one of the best smelling fragrances dealing with laundry in a long time.                                                                     One tip is that if you hang your items to dry (or only partially dry them), they will smell fresh for a really long time. If you dry them all the way, the smell doesn't last as long.                                                                     I use these with our sheets, towels, and my kids tennis shoes which I wash weekly. Since they are air dried, they smell great!"
4.00,"I purchased this with skepticism. The purple smelled way better (less cheapy) than the blue bottle.                                                                     I use this for my towels since I don't use fabric softener on them and also use for sheets.  The smell lasts a few days and is pleasant.  Towels can get a musty smell over time and mine smell oh-so-fresh! The down side is to get a decent amount of smell, you need to use about a half a cap full.  The bottle has about 12 full cap fulls in it, making it kinda expensive for fresh smelling towels.  If you use this for every load, it won't last long."
3.00,"This will definitely leave a scent in your laundry and even in your whole house if you put enough in. I think one teaspoon is plenty for my taste. I like the scent fine, but don't love it. I really don't love the house smelling like it when I put in 1/2 of the cup provided. I can't imagine what a whole cup would do. It did, on one load, mask the slight sour scent from leaving it in too long. And it is fun to have that perfume to my clothes when they're done. It's definitely stronger than my regular fabric softener (bounce sheets), especially at 1/4 to 1/2 cupfull.If you like the scent of laundry detergents, then this would be perfect for you. Me? I don't know. I'll keep it around for loads that are starting to sour. I kind of like putting in a teaspoon for most loads, but I question the real need for it on a regular basis."
5.00,"This is the best smelling stuff!! OMG! Every time I was clothes, I use this and my whole house smells like Downey. I got my daughter addicted to it and have a bottle to mail to my sister! If you haven't tried the unstoppables, TRY it and you'll LOVE it!"
3.00,"If you like the scent of Febreze, you'll love the &quot;Fresh&quot; scent. If, however, the smell of Febreze makes you retch (as it does me), think twice before purchasing &quot;Fresh&quot;. Haven't tried &quot;Lush&quot; or &quot;Shimmer&quot; yet. Once my stomach settles and my nose clears up, maybe..."
5.00,"I use this on my sheets every time I wash them and I love the smell. So clean smelling and it really does last a few days."
4.00,"Smells good in the bottle, but will have try with unscented detergent to see how good it really is, I'll keep this scent for my fiance's clothes and by myself the spring scent because it smells more like april fresh."
4.00,"Really the headline says it all. I was just surprised that ordering it in bulk didn't save more cost. Smells nice though."
5.00,"The Downy Unstopables in Wash Fresh Scent Booster is everything it advertises and more.  With using only one cap full, my entire load of laundry smelled divine; even after coming out of the dryer.                                                                     This product is easy to use -- just put one cap full in your wash water as the tub is filling up and as this product states, your laundry comes out smelling clean, fresh and totally awesome!                                                                     I definitely recommend this product and have since bought my own.  I loved it.                                                                     Natalie S. for Amazon Vine"
3.00,"It smells fabulous. But I just didn't real feel like it was worth the additional expense. One bottle only lasted my family for about 3-4 weeks."
5.00,"This product works wonders. I live in an apartment, which does not have laundry in each unit. We all share a laundry room for every two building s(i.e.24 units total). Most of the time, our laundry smells...well a little stinky even after washing it. We have tried everything from febreeze to exrta soap to anything that you can think of. This item works wonders. THANK YOU DOWNY!!"
5.00,"Long lasting freshness in every load! Only use if you like your clothes to have a strong scent. We love this product,"
5.00,"I love this product and wished I had it for all those days when I did laundry at the laundry mat. I hated carrying that heavy jug of detergent, and so I would always use the sheets even though they were never as good as the liquid fabric softener. These beads freshen my clothes so much better than the sheets. Additionally, I've put a tablespoon in a tulle bag and keep them in the drawers to keep my clothes fresh while in the closet."
5.00,"I am a machinist. As a machinist I use coolant (soluble oil) and cutting oil to do my work on lathes and mills. I often work on conventional machines ,where it is difficult to avoid getting coolant or oil on my shirt and pants. So I do my own laundry and I tried several other products to remove the lingering smell from my clothes. But nothing seems to work well and even though my clothes are clean they still wreek from the oil odor. I found Downy unstopable at my local HD. I use this on my weekly work clothes laundry everytime now. It really works it removes the strong odor and even softens my clothes. I highly recommend Downy Unstopables to anyone that is a machinist , mechanic,or person that works around oil."
2.00,"I just don't see the point in buying something like this. I used it, but since I already use fabric softener, boosting the scent is simply overkill and a waste of money."
4.00,"Nice product, easy to use and smells nice. Would definitely purchase again, makes clothing smells nice. I recommend this product!"
5.00,"Downy Unstopables should be in every house. This stuff makes your clothes smell fantastic. I use these on top of my normal mixture that goes in my washer.                                                                     1 Scoop of Detergent                                              1 Scoop of Baking Soda                                              Gain Fabric Softener                                              Cap of Downy Unstopables"
5.00,"I got these at RiteAid originally and after my first use, I absolutely fell in love! My husband even noticed that the clothes smelled \"fresher\". I love the scent, it's simple but nice and powerful. We only use about 1/4-1/2 lid full per load. For the two of us, we go through one of these in about a month. I add half of what we measure out before anything else, and then the other half on top of the load right before I close the lid. I have started to pair this with the \"Downy Infusions Liquid Fabric Softener\" in the scent \"Honey Flower\". And I think the two pair lovely together. I could never go back to just detergent. Bottom line: This stuff is amazing, makes our clothes smell great, and is worth every penny."
5.00,"I love this scent! There are some issues with allergies to dyes and strong perfumes in my house so I stay away from those mechanically infused \"waterfall/spring garden/ Hawaiin mist/fill in the blank\" scents. However, this booster was soft and gave a lovely smell, yet withstood the heat of the dryer to leave a lovely soft scent. I will say that by day 3 the scent was gone but it is a nice booster to add to your delicats. To be honest I would't spend the money to add it to every piece of clothing as I view this in the category of Woolite(something you would use on your favorite clothing or delicates)."
5.00,"I absolutely love this product!  I always buy it every week, I love how my clothes smell when I use it!!                                                                     The smell actually lasts a long time, and you don't need to use a lot of it in every load, but I make sure I never run out, and always get extras when it is on sale.                                                                     I recommend it to all my friends."
5.00,"Pricey, but it does keep your laundry smelling fresher longer especially if you hang out your clothes. I've only tried this scent and it smells fresh and clean."
4.00,"These do add a great smell to the clothes after laundry. I'm not sure they are worth the cost though, so I dropped a star."
5.00,"The lingering fresh smell is awesome. After a week of folded towels - the freshness lingers. I love it and my family enjoys the freshness"
5.00,"I truly love this product. It's a bit pricey compared to the regular liquid fabric softener but definitely worth it. I especially enjoy using this product for bedding, jeans, and bath towels."
5.00,"I love this stuff It makes your clothes smell so good and it is very easy to use. I will buy forever"
5.00,"It works very nicely, and smells great. We use this for all our bedding and the smell lasts and lasts."
4.00,"Good product, easy to use, but my clothes stay fresh for only about a week or so. I still continue to use it though as it leaves the whole laundry room with a fresh scent and I think I'm addicted to the smell!"
1.00,"I had wanted to try this to see if it would help my sheets stay nicely scented longer. I used a small amount in my first load-nothing. Used half a cap in the second-still nothing. I did not want to spend $10 or whatever for the large bottle and had gotten a coupon and used it to purchase what they called a trial size bottle. Still paid over $5 for it even with the coupon. I am so glad I did not spend more. Total waste of money. No scent right from the dryer let alone after sitting for weeks in storage. How on earth do they get away with advertising that it ha this wonderful long lasting scent? lesson learned"
5.00,"This stuff makes your laundry smell wonderful! I f I don't have it, I wont do laundry!!"
5.00,"This one is the best scent of them all but you are unable to find them many places so I get mine from here"
3.00,"Downy laundry scent booster does in fact leave your laundry smelling great- but it's definitely a light scent. The Gain brand are much stronger and leave the laundry smelling fresh much longer."
3.00,"Downy Unstopables In Wash Fresh Scent Booster - I like these scent boosters. They are not fabric softeners, they just add a scent to your clothes. You shake out a little or a lot into the cap and then add to the clothes while washing.                                              The scent is stronger when you add to the wash than when you take them out of the dryer. I think it fades some once the clothes have dried.                                              I think they're expensive for what they're supposed to do, although I do like this product."
5.00,"The Downy Unstopables in Fresh smells amazing. When I am doing laundry I can smell it throughout my place. The scent reminds me of Irish Spring mixed with Tide Mountain Spring Scent. The product on its own is amazing; however the drawback is the lack of scent choices and correlations with other scented products. I assume that Procter and Gamble wanted to test the waters first before they created too many scents but depending on what detergent and softener you use both scents could clash with them. My favorite detergent is Tide Total Care, but Gain Apple Mango Tango is my favorite laundry scent. I used it with the Gain and I felt that the scents almost cancelled each other out with the Downy scent being a little more dominant. I also use this to make scent pouches, I just put a few pellets in a small mesh, muslin, or gauze cloth, tie it with a ribbon and now my drawers smell amazing. One problem I have is that the directions states to use a little or a lot, there are lines in the cap to measure but it would have been nice to have some general guidelines on how much to use. I suspect that this could have been on purpose to encourage people to purchase a new bottle sooner than necessary, creating more revenue, which is fine by me, but just a thought to put out there. The last thing I am surprised at is the price here on Amazon; I was able to purchase one bottle on sale for $5.99 at Target with a regular price of $6.99. I find that overall this product serves its purpose but is not necessary as it only adds scent and could be considered a luxury laundry product. One last thing to mention, `unstopables' is misspelled, which makes looking for it online a little confusing. I hope that it was on purpose so they could trademark the name and was not an oversight on the company's part."
5.00,"I love the unstopables as they really do have a nice, long lasting addition to the laundry without having to use liquid softener. Also, just like the package says you can add a little or a lot depending upon how strong you want once they come out of the dryer. They also retain the scent while using a different brand of dryer sheet for static cling. There are a few different scents and i have tried just about all of them, so while this is not necessarily the strongest one, it is my favorite! (hint, if you want stronger the one with the dark pink lid is very strong and you really don't need that much.) Great product!"
5.00,"Unstopables are a must have in every load of laundry i do now. its amazing how fresh my sheets smell after sitting on a shelf for a few weeks, simply amazing and refreshing."
2.00,"I really like the smell of the Downy Unstopables. But what really are they for? I use Tide or Gain and my laundry always smells nice. I just don't know why you would need to add one more thing on top of detergent and softener."
5.00,"My sister in law bought these and left them at our house...I was skeptical at first I thought they were dumb and a waste of money. It took me about a year to use the first bottle of them...and to my surprise I missed them! So now I buy them as well. For the towel loads and the loads of just my clothes (not my husband's) I add them. I think it does give and extra smell boost of freshness. I kinda of consider them 'special occasion'. So if I am in the mood I use them and if not I don't. They are so strong (and good) after washing but after drying the good smell fades a bit. Still I think they are a fun thing to add for the housewives out there to treat themselves a bit lol. Ha"
5.00,"Love this in the Fresh Scent (it seems to last the longest from the other Downy scents for some reason). It leaves everything smelling fresh for days. I especially love using Unstopables with my sheets and towels. I'm hooked!"
3.00,"Ok, so, I'm not all that familiar with the scent booster products, but the commercials make them look awesome. Amazon had a fantastic price on this, so I gave it a whirl. It had the best reviews as far as scent goes. The pros? It works. You really smell that smell. The cons, the smell, while vaguely reminiscent of \"freshness\" is a little MORE reminiscent of \"crazy glue.\" My husband now goes on and on about the crazy glue smell in the bed, which, if the ads on TV are correct, should last about 5 more weeks. Awesome. I'll try this again, but maybe in a different scent. Perhaps, they have a gorilla glue scent? Update: March 9, 2014. The smell is now *almost* gone, and has entered what could, perhaps, be seen as pleasant now. Took quite a while though, no joke. GO LIGHTLY with the application on this stuff."
4.00,"I've tried the blue and pink of this product - pink is my new fav! It gives clothing/towels that extra boost of scent to give you that freshly-washed smell just a little longer than detergent alone. Throughout the use of my first bottle (blue) I did find that not-completely dissolved pellet stuck to a shirt of jeans every so often... but they have become a part of my regular laundry routine."
5.00,"I use this on all of our bedding because of the lovely smell. I also use it for my fine clothing. Too expensive to use on more but would sure like to."
5.00,"I can't stop raving about these unstopables. I sprinkled them under my sheets so I could smell the fresh scent, even- I put them in the bottom of our garbage can too- they are awesome~"
5.00,"My wife love this product and then fragance for the laundry, very goood th edelivery on time and conditions, very good"
4.00,"I totally love this scent booster. The only one thing I've noticed that only blue ones are very strong, other ones are not as powerful. The cheapest price on these downys are at Costco, moreover, they sell them in HUUUUUGE packs, which is very good too. Very glad I found these ones, bc I really like when my laundry smells fresh and clean. I use this product with all the ORIGINAL GAIN products (liquid detergent, softener). They give a wonderful smell all together."
5.00,"I really enjoy this product. The amount one would use is adjustable. No after product to throw away. I love the scents that are available. Larger quantities (19.5 oz) to choose from. The quality of this product is amazing! I'm really hooked on this product!"
5.00,"excellent product"
4.00,"First, these are way too expensive here. Get them for $2 or more dollars less locally.                                              That said, I love these.  Took a few loads of laundry to figure out the way to get the most and longest lasting scent.                                              For a large load of sheets or whatever, use a whole cap.  I know, it's a lot.  Just trust me for a minute.  The most important thing:  dry your items on LOW until they are JUST dry.  I have an anti-bac setting on my dryer, and even setting the temp on low, the scent was mostly baked out of my sheets.  Better yet, hang or liine dry whatever you can.  Not always an option, I know.                                              I only use this for sheets, towels, throw rugs etc.  And following the above instructions, I've gotten the most out of this product and love it.                                              And this scent?  Lush is right.  LOVE it for sheets and towels, I use the blue for throw rugs.  Nice and fresh.  Hope this helps someone!                                              Subtracted one star as this bottle does not last long at all."
5.00,"My mother does demos on the weekend and she had demoed these so she brought a couple of samples home for me to try. My sister came by one day for my help on something and asked if she could bring her laundry so I said yes. I still had the packets sitting on the dryer and she said she loved these things. I hadn't tried them so we used a whole packet in the wash and OMG! the smell permeated through the whole house! I wash all of my clothes with a cap full of crystals now. My jeans smell great for days! Every time I have freshly washed jeans, coworkers at work comment on how good I smell. :) I need to compare the prices here at Amazon vs the grocery store. The blue cap is my favorite. I bought some of the purple but not a fan; I haven't tried the pink yet because I'm in love with the blue cap smell. Along with my Purex Linens and Lillies laundry liquid and the Downy Unstopables, they remind me of a laundry detergent I had bought in England many years ago that had a nice strong fresh scent that lasted for days on in called Radion. Triple LOVE this stuff!"
5.00,"My towels, sheets and clothes smell fantastic and fresh for weeks after using washing. I have been using Downy Unstopables for over 7 months. I bought a new washer and dryer for a new home and thought I would give my beautiful new machines an extra perk. WOW! WOW! I have been hooked ever since. Admittedly, I do not use much at all. Because I have a new high efficient machine, I do not need much of any product. One bottle of Unstopables lasted about four months and I do about 6-8 large loads of laundry a week. I still use fabric softener and Tide with a touch of Downy and fabric softener sheets in the dryer. I do not add liquid fabric softener to my laundry when washing towels. So, I have read a few other reviewers mention the additional high cost. It can be fairly negligible if you purchase this on sale or bulk and use wisely. The reward to your nose is worth it. My scent of choice is lush (purple). It is a bit more subtle than the most popular blue labeled scent. I enjoy lavendar in many things around the house and use lavendar pillow sprays when I change the sheets to promote restful sleep. Your linen closets will smell wonderful, as will your drawers and traditional closets. This will give your workout clothes an extra perspiration anti-stink fighting boost because they already smell delicious. You will want to bury your face in your towels, pillows and even your kitchen towels, which I think can pick up odors quickly. The only thing you may want to consider is guests or family members who are sensitive to fragrance and/or perfumes. I teach Yoga and other execise classes at my home. I love washing towels for my Yogi with Unstopables, but I always have a few towels available that have not been washed with extra perfumes. Enjoy!!"
5.00,"I bought this to try because my son told me it smells good, I used it and it makes your clothes smell so good when you take them out.  I have already recommended the product to others and I plan on buying more when I need it."
5.00,"I am one of those guys out there that does the laundry. Especially since I have one of the new front loading Samsung He washers that can handle all of the clothes that I throw at it. Before doing a load, I add a half cap full of these scent booster beads to the wash, add the clothes and start the process. After switching to the dryer and they finish drying, it's so nice to have such a clean fresh smell to the wash that it actually makes folding less of a chore. Highly recommend this product!!"
4.00,"You don't need much and when you do pour it toward back of washer if using front loading machines."
3.00,"We like the Downy Unstopables, but really did not care for this scent. It did not hold it's scent very long after the wash was over."
5.00,"I like to use this in my drapes and scatter rugs, but most of all the dogs bed, the smell lingers in the air for a long time especially if you do not dry the item. I always hang my drapes damp."
5.00,"I always use this product when doing my laundry. I absolutely love the scent and love how it lingers on my clothes for weeks after the laundry is done. The fragrance spreads through the whole house when the laundry is going. Sometimes when my room isn't smelling as nice as I like, I will even pour a little in a small bowl and the product will freshen my room. I would recommend this product, as it will keep your laundry smelling nice for weeks!"
5.00,"What a brilliant idea from Downy to create a fragrance for laundry that doesn't involve fabric softener. I don't use fabric softener for my bath towels because it ruins the absorbency, but Unstopables adds a glorious scent that lingers for days and days afterwards. It's so wonderful I also use it (in addition to fabric softener) for bedsheets because the fragrance is so lovely when we go to sleep at night. Give it a try!"
5.00,"Best smell out of all of them . The fragrance last for days I like that you add it to washer at the start so I never forget to add on rinse cycle again :)"
3.00,"Yes, I only gave this product 3 stars but that is strictly based on the scent factor. The product does work and even going to my closet and pulling something out that was washed weeks ago you can still smell the Fresh Scent Booster. The problem is, it's way to flowery and my husband hates it (I'm not really thrilled with the scent either). He says he feels ridiculous walking around at work smelling like he's wearing perfume. Wish they would come up with a less feminine scent, like cotton linen or even something citrusy because while I don't \"hate\" the scent, since my husband does and I wash our cloths together, I can't use it without making him crazy. Even using it on the towels and sheets makes him unhappy because it really is a very strong feminine scent."
5.00,"Love these scent boosters! I tried them when they first came out and have been using them ever since. The Fresh Scent is my favorite, but they are all nice. The smell that it leaves with your laundry does stay for quite a while. My daughter has somewhat sensitive skin and this hasn't bothered her in the slightest."
5.00,"I use this for performance clothing since you can't use fabric softner or it ruins the quick dry and wicking effect. It works great and a few go a long way."
5.00,"I love how this makes my laundry smell. Not too strong or overpowering, and I recommend any but the lavender scents to help freshen up your boys clothes!"
5.00,"I have alot of different fabric softners, but I never seen anything like this product. It made my clothes very soft and the smell lasted even after wearing the clothes. I will continue to buy this product and I will recommend trying it."
5.00,"I do a lot of running / gym workouts, and this really makes all of those clothes smell great.  With regular clothes, you get the great smell along with the option of no fabric softner.  There is just no instructions on how much to use with your wash...."
5.00,"I like the smell, it follows it out of the dryer even! You get six small bottles of this stuff but it ends up equalling around the same amount of the large one you find at costco or walmart but are easier to move around since it is one small bottle. Nothing much to say but I love the smell :)"
5.00,"I've used this for about a year now and I like the scents and they last long. There's clothes that I don't use for weeks and when I put them on they still smell good. I highly recommend it."
3.00,"\"Unstopables\" indeed can add a wonderful scent to one's laundry. My reservation is that, since it has no other function, it is costly to use yet another product, where using Downy fabric softener would both add scent and remove wrinkles from materials.                                                                     I tried Unstopables on several loads of laundry. I found that, though any amount can add some attractive scent, for it to be noticeable or enduring requires using a full capful. (Doing so gave my bedding and curtains a wonderful effect.) I also noticed that, for whites, neither the scent of bleach nor of the scent booster is especially noticeable - apparently the combination reduces the Downy scent.                                                                     It is a pleasant, attractive addition to the linen room, but a bit pricey. I would prefer to wait for coupons and sales, and get \"Tide with a touch of Downy,\" or Downy fabric softener - scent plus cleansing or softening."
3.00,"The scent of these beads is heavenly. However, I notice that the scent does not last long - only 1-2 days after I pull the clothes out of the dryer. So, I only notice the smell when I am filling the washer or pulling the clothes out of the dryer. By the time I wear them, I can't tell that I ever used them. Therefore, I think they are somewhat of a waste of money. After using them in every load for around six months, I noticed my skin was itchy. Once I stopped using these, the irritation went away. I do have pretty sensitive skin with eczema, so perhaps this is to be expected. But, the liquid softener made by Downy in the same scent does not cause skin irritation. I say save your money and get the same scent in a liquid softener or dryer sheets - both come in the same scent line, are cheaper per load, and the smell lasts longer."
1.00,"Not a Bargain! It is cheaper to buy 4 individual containers. Just order the 4 individuals and save about ten dollars."
1.00,"I purchased the Lush scent of this product. I use Tide Coldwater He liquid detergent and                                              Downy fabric softener.  I added a capful of Unstopables as directed and after machine                                              drying, there was absolutely no scent of Lush.  The only way that the scent would come                                              through would be if you used unscented detergent and unscented or no fabric softener.                                              Otherwise, these Unstopables are a waste of money.                                                                     I've often wondered, if Tide is the highest rated, most advertised, and most expensive                                              detergent, why does Tide market so many additional additives which add considerably to                                              the cost of each washload?  If Tide detergent is as good as they say it is then we                                              shouldn't need anything else except fabric softener which I use sparingly mainly to eliminate                                              static cling.  Hint:  Never use fabric softener on towels as it reduces their absorbency.                                              Fabric softener is oil-based and puts a coating on fabrics.  This is helpful on clothing                                              because it helps with stain removal and eliminates static.  However, on any type                                              of towel - bath towels, hand towels, kitchen towels, it greatly reduces their absorbency                                              and drying time.  And of course, NEVER use fabric softener on microfiber cloths - it ruins them."
5.00,"Downy Unstopables does leave your laundry with a fresh scent.  Just do not use as much as the directions tell you to, they will not dissolve completely in a HE washer."
5.00,"This is my favorite smell of the 3 different scents that Downy Unstopables has, it is a light scent but you CAN smell it. I don't have a HE washing machine just a regular top loader and for a medium load of laundry I use to the second line of the cap and everything comes out smelling awesome. If you're wanting a STRONG smell I would go for the fresh scent (blue). There is nothing I can say bad about any of the scents but everyone has their favorite and this is mine."
2.00,"I tried the one with a purple lid. Initially I was super excited because as weird as it is, I love doing laundry. I like the way the purple one smells - sort of heady and musky with a splash of floral. Green is definately \"clean\".                                                                     The perk is that it made my entire apartment smell like the beads. The downfall is that it really didn't stay on anything I washed. I followed the directions exactly and it didn't matter what kind of water I used or how much...the scent just isn't strong. I also tried without a fabric softener and dryer sheets and it's still very weak. Once the items were folded and put away,it was gone.                                                                     I haven't bought anymore - it's expensive for a smell that doesn't stay. I would rather use dryer sheets.                                                                     I have a very sensitive sense of smell so I can be certain it's very weak."
1.00,"I added this to a batch of homemade laundry detergent -- somewhat reluctantly as I usually don't go for strong chemical scents. Over a few washes I liked the results -- you can clearly tell by smell what loads of laundry are washed and which are not.                                                                     Then I developed a rash -- atopic dermatitis -- traceable to the Unstopables -- the only significant change in my routine. Now I nickname them Downy Untouchables. Googling I quickly found many other reports of this kind of problem.                                                                     I'll retired the beads to towels and sheets only and hope that works -- no more for my clothes."
5.00,"All Downy Unstoppables are amazing! I absolutely LOVE the fragrances. Because they are a little pricey, I only use them every so often. But when I do, WOW! You can smell them from outside while the clothes are drying! BTW, I use approximately 2 capfuls of the balls. Some people say they don't smell a difference, so my suggestion is to add more."
5.00,"I was skeptical at first, like, how can little beads make your clothes smell good?! But, I decided to give these a try anyway. I just go by the lid lines (where it tells small, medium, or large loads). I love these because you can use them with, or without, fabric softener. Although these smell great and make my clothes smell as equally great, I'm not so sure the scent lasts 12 weeks. The scent lasts a decent amount of time, just not 12 weeks. All in all, I will continue to use these beads. Their great on everything, and they keep my towels smelling fresh."
5.00,"This is the best smelling of the three Downy Scents. I am addicted to these things, they make laundry smell soooooo good."
5.00,"This is the best stuff!  I love that it smells like the ORIGINAL Downy fabric softener.  It really does keep clothes smelling good until the next wash, bedding too!  Can't ask for more.  I will definitely buy this again, even with the slightly high price."
4.00,"This was a gift for my daughter. She loves this product since they have hard water, it makes her laundry smell and feel good."
5.00,"These are the best smelling laundry fresheners of all we have tried. I play hockey and my gear gets nasty. My fellow team-mates pay services to clean their gear. This is a much cheaper solution which works just as well if not better. I highly recommend this. Trust me, I have tried everything else. I tried other brands granules product and the resulting smell is awful. The blue UnStopables were the best of all."
4.00,"Love using these but will be in store instead of here next time due to pricing and having to put it as an 'add on' or subscribed item. Just not feasible to buy online"
5.00,"scent and last a very long time! No residue on clothes like liquid fabric softener,,, a little will do to add lasting fragrance"
5.00,"This smells amazing! SO glad we started using this scent booster :) My clothes never seemed to smell as good as they should and now they do!"
5.00,"I was first introduced to Downy Unstopables from a free sample pack I received from an online promotion. I was amazed at not only how great this product smells but also how long it lasted! I made the horrible mistake of buying the Lush scent (purple bottle) when I bought it at the store. Something told me to stick with the Fresh scent but I was feeling adventurous and curious.                                                                     From now on I refuse to buy Lush scent as it's very weak and doesn't last as long as the Fresh scent."
5.00,"Very nice product to add to your wash - gives clothes a nice, clean, fresh smell. I add it to all my laundry."
5.00,"My spouse loves Downy Unstoppables! Very easy too use ! Pricey, but makes laundry smell clean and fresh! Try it!"
5.00,"Lush scent is ahhhhmazing!!  I am crazy about this stuff!  It smells so great and lingers for a long time."
2.00,"for starters, This is not a fabric softener. Downy unstoppables are an in-wash scent booster                                                                     They look like pieces of Nerds candy that you add to the start of your load to provide a long lasting scent.                                                                     While it smells great and does provide a nice fresh scent, it doesn't last. I used it on a blanket. the smell wore off after just 2 days. so I really wouldn't consider it \"lasting\". I tried using more the 2nd time I washed my blanket - same.                                                                     I've had bounce dryer sheets &amp; febreeze's freshness last a lot longer. so I can't really recommend this."
5.00,"This is my favorite of the Unstopable scents. It keeps my laundry smelling super fresh and is a lifesaver when washing gym clothes (and not using fabric softener)."
5.00,"Love THIS Product,,Keeps Clothes Fresh Smelling For Weeks,,,,Only Product I Will Use !!,,Would Like To Seer More Scents Offered By Downy !!"
5.00,"Will make your clothes smell absolutely wonderful and the smell will last a few washes. What more can I say."
5.00,"These smell amazing. You can stand at your closet door and just inhale the wonderful aroma after you've put these in a few loads. It's great."
3.00,"This does give my laundry a nice smell when it comes out of the washer and dryer, but the smell doesn't last more than a day or two."
5.00,"I got this originally with a special bonus buy and now use them on all my sheets and towels to keep them fresher longer. I just pulled out a sheet set that I washed two weeks ago from the closet and they smell like they were just washed today. LOVE IT!"
5.00,"looove how amazing my clothes smell using the unstopables all of the scents :)"
5.00,"My girls love the sent of these products. They keep clothes fresh even after outdoor play! They each have different scents."
5.00,"I tried this for the first time as a free sample sent out by Downy. I loved it so much that I immediately ordered some from amazon.com. My towels sometimes smell stale from sitting in the linen closet for a while. After adding this to the washer, they smell wonderful and freshly laundered. I highly recommend this product!"
5.00,"I love the way Downy Unstoppables make my laundry smell, and this is my favorite of all the scents. I'm addicted now and add it to every load of laundry I do."
4.00,"I enjoy making my own laundry soap but my husband doesn't like that the clothes don't come out smelling like store bought detergent, so this product was our solution. I like that it is easy to use and not messy. I wish the scent was even stronger. That is why I didn't give it the full 5 stars."
5.00,"I love these. They smell good, and they make my clothes smell really good. Not sure the effect they have on my machine yet, but I like them."
4.00,"Downy Unstoppables does what it claims...the \"flavor\" lasts for a looong time.                                                                     It's easy to use, just throw a capful in when you begin the load of laundry. The little capsules break down and do their thing, imparting scent throughout the load.                                                                     The only drawback is the scent of the Unstoppable tends to compete with the scent of the detergent, until the detergent cries \"Uncle!\" and the Unstoppable scent takes over.                                                                     For those of you who like the clean scent of fresh laundry, this is a great product for you. If you wear any sort of perfume or aftershave on a regular basis, this product will interfere.                                                                     All in all, I like it and will continue to purchase and use this product."
2.00,"I was so excited to try these as I absolutely LOVE Downy Unstopables and wish they had more scents. So when I saw this I couldn't wait to try it. I am a seasonal person and use the blue/green ones and the pink ones in the spring and summer. In the fall and winter I like heavier scents so I use the light pink (lush?) and the purple. These smell very good, however it doesn't work nearly as well as they other unstopables do. You can barely smell it in your clothes at all. I was extremely disappointed. So instead of using them in my clothes I put a few in my vacuum to help make the house smell less like kids and animals. In my opinion, the purple smells just as good, is stronger and lasts much longer."
2.00,"Did not like the smell of this product, plus I found a much cheaper brand that smells better, and lasts longer on clothes."
5.00,"I love this stuff. It makes my linens and clothes smell so fresh, not just per fumy!! You wont be disappointed!"
5.00,"Great smell and long lasting smell. Even works as a freshner if added to water and put in a spray bottle and sprayed on fabrics."
5.00,"I would recommend this to everyone. I love the smell and while it's washing you have wonderful aroma in your house. I also recommend Gain."
5.00,"Unstopables reallywork! I love the smell that scents the room when my clothes are washing. I would recommend to anyone"
2.00,"This product destroyed my comforter.  It didn't dissolve like it was suppose to and now my comforter is all marked up and can't be fixed.  I used this on my clothes and towels without a problem but it attacked my bedding with a vengeance.  I wanted to like this product but can't after that."
4.00,"I actually initially bought this because my front-loader had a decidedly unclean odor.  It was fall, my kids spent most days getting dirty and/or muddy, and all of that went into the washer.  The washer did not respond very well.  I tried everything to get rid of the funk - He washer cleaners, Borax, Tide packets, nothing worked.  Another reviewer recommended these, so I thought, hey, why not?  Unstoppables actually worked!  The funk is gone, and the clothes have a nice lavender scent. I love it on the towels and sheets.  I don't wash my husband's work shirts in this, as he does not really want to smell like a flower, but otherwise I LOVE this product.  I sprinkle a little into each load.  There is no residue and the fragrance really is mellow, not overwhelming like you'd think when first opening the bottle.                                              The only drawback has been the cost - I wish it were not quite so pricey for an additive.  I do note that the price here fluctuates.  On occasion it's been far less here than at our local household store, and sometimes it's a dollar or three more."
5.00,"My mom got a free sample of this and I loved it so I bought some more! I love using this for my dance wear to keep them smelling fresh."
5.00,"I am obsessed with these things! I use them in ever load of laundry! I tried to only put them in with certain items: towels, bedding... things that I don't wash everyday. But now I cant do a load of laundry without them! I love the clean scent that fabric holds. I have been purchasing them since they came out and don't plan to stop. This is one item that I tell my friends and family about - and have gotten many many people hooked. My little girls love them too! they both still use a blanky, so its nice dragging the blankets around and having them smell fresh even two weeks after washing them. I am currently subscribing to them to get the additional discount - help me justify using an additive in my laundry. Side note - you still use your regular fabric softener, detergent, etc. These are simply just thrown in with your laundry in the same area you put your clothes in the wash. They aren't meant to clean, just meant to leave youe stuff smelling fresh for weeks. HIGHLY recommend. These are the best things ever!"
5.00,"I LOVE this product. I don't use much per load, but it does the trick to keep my laundry smelling fresh. It is a great compliment to my fabric softener"
5.00,"Ok, so when I saw this on the Vine Program I immediately jumped on it, I have been wanting to try these for a while now and I was waiting to see who would be cheaper (Amazon or Wal-Mart) when I saw the price online and saw the price in Wal-Mart it was a no brainer. (My Wal-Mart has these for $6.97). I live in an apartment complex so I have been looking for something to make my laundry have a really nice scent. I am a Gain fan and realized that their fabric softeners are not as strong as their detergents, so I have been using Downy fabric softener with Gain detergent. This has been working GREAT, so I figured I would give these crystals a try. Low and behold they are AMAZING; however I didn't use a scented softener with these crystals, because they already had a nice scent. I used an original scented softener and added the crystals all in together. My clothes came out smelling magnificent; they had a fresh and crisp smell to them. I even went back and washed my sheets (even though I washed them last week) so they could have the same scent. The reason I use a softener with them, is because the directions do not state that the crystals are a fabric softener, it states it's a scent booster and I like my clothes to feel soft and smooth, so if you want to use these instead of fabric softener then I am giving you a heads up, the scent will come through (maybe not as strong), but your clothes may not be nice and soft."
5.00,"I'm a man but that doesn't mean I like musty smelling clothes, these Downy Scent Boosters last for over a month. I got a free sample and I thought \"what the heck\", now I'm hooked on them. The Fresh scent reminds me of Bounce sheets but the scent from these crystals last longer, fresh smelling but not too foo-foo. It even gets rid of those funky sneaker odors."
5.00,"This stuff smells so good. I don't usually like plain lavender scents, but this lavender is sweeter; it reminds me of the Lavender & Vanilla Odor Eliminating Wallflower at B&BW. And it is very longlasting. It's especially good for sheets or clothing that will be stored for awhile and not used often, as it keeps them smelling fresh."
5.00,"We really enjoy using these! They keep our clothes smelling fresher, longer, and are easy to use. Instead of buying scented laundry soap (which by the time the clothes rinse hardly has any scent left) or buying watered down soap, just sprinkle in a few of these. The scent also lasts through the dryer and into your closet! We've tried all scents and this is our most favorite"
1.00,"Let me start off by saying, I really wanted to love this product. I used it first on my sheets, comforter and towels. The smell is heavenly! Unfortunately, I developed such a bad rash almost instantly, that I had to see a doctor. An unstoppable, itchy, red, blotchy, mess. My skin just does NOT like this product. Very sad. Not sure what they put in it that caused me to have such a bad reaction, but if you are the type to be sensitive to perfumes, dyes and fragrance even in the slightest bit, do NOT use this product. I repeat, do not use this product."
5.00,"I love Tide I haven't been able to find Downy with lavender scent When I found this Tide product I was very happy!"
4.00,"I love the smell, but just take care that you don't use too many. In most of the HE washers I've tried these in, they don't dissolve completely but leave a clumpy residue. Just a little goes a long way."
5.00,"I love this line of Downey to use on towels and other items that I don't use fabric softener on. I use white towels, so even with bleach in the load, they come out smelling awesome from this add in product. The spring scent is just delicious. The scent lasts, so linens or towels still smell great after a few weeks. I haven't tested it any longer than that so I can't really say if the scent sticks around for months. This is my favorite scent so far. Keep up the good work Downey!"
5.00,"I have this on autoship. I don't use them in all loads because I don't like to add cost to my laundry. However, I do always use them when I do towels and bedding. There is nothing like cuddling up with your favorite blanket and it smells so good!"
5.00,"My daughter-in-law was using this when I was visiting. Very surprising to find how long it will last. Great for bath towels, hand towels, ect... So fresh smelling."
1.00,"Dont really get this crap It;s a lot of money for something that does next to nothing !!! Puh-lease get lost"
5.00,"These things smell so great and floral! They last a while in my clothes too keeping the closet fresh. Way better than the outrageously suffocating blue ones."
5.00,"Bought this originally to try-loved it. Have had it on my subscribe and save ever since. Personally, I use it in the rinse cycle instead of the wash just to intensify the aroma. Would definitely recommend."
5.00,"I love this product. It should be cheaper to the consumer because it is a little bit pricey. This is my favorite scent."
5.00,"We live on a well and I am not fond of the way our laundry smells after time. This I add liberally to our wash and our towels, bedding and clothes stay fresh for WEEKS! I must admit, this isn't my favorite scent, I prefer the pink cap but it is very nice."
5.00,"Unstopables are really unstopable! You add a the correct amount directly into your washer and the magic happens. No more wondering if the smell of your favorite sent is really going to stay, with this product, the smell lasts for weeks! Of course be sure you really like the smell because it may take a few washes to get it out."
5.00,"I didn't think that these boosters would work any different than detergent or softener. I was wrong!                                                                     They are easy to use and don't leave any stains, which I was also concerned with.                                                                     The smell is delightful, especially on nicely heated fresh towels."
5.00,"Clean, fresh scent that you add at the beginning of the wash cycle. Makes your laundry smell so clean -- don't know how I lived without this!"
4.00,"These are quite nice and definitely do work as advertised, though you need about a capful for a full load of laundry for you to be able to smell any sort of persisting scent. I'd suggest using them on towels and bedsheets, otherwise I don't think they're really necessary on clothes."
3.00,"FRAGRANCE IS GOOD! PRICE IS TOO HIGH FOR JUST A GOOD OK RATING. If the price was lower, I would purchase again."
5.00,"Ive tried alot of different products/fragrances, and this one by far is the best one. Love the scent, and all my clothes smell so good, especially my pillowcase. You will love this product as much as I do."
5.00,"I got a sample of this a couple of weeks ago and finally tried it yesterday. We've got a lot of cats (rescued) and the odor that goes with them. I wash towels and throw rugs often. I think using this long lasting scent is going to help. A lot. And maybe they won't like the smell and will use the litterbox, which I wish they'd be using anyway.                                                                     It's on my list for my next shopping trip."
5.00,"I love this stuff so much. Sweaters that I put away in boxes for a year still smell good! I try to ration it out so it will last longer (using it on sheets and towels only), but I really love to use it on everything. I have a friend who was afraid to start using it because she knew she would become addicted to it, too. So I bought her some as a gift. True story. It's good stuff."
5.00,"My fabric softener was causing my HE front loader to get nasty build up. I used softener for the fresh smell. These scent boosters give me the fresh smell without the build up. A little pricey if you use in every load"
5.00,"I LOVE DOWNY UNSTOPPABLES I ONLY USE IT FOR MY SHEETS, TOWELS, BLANKETS..ETC..THE SCENT LASTS FOREVER"
4.00,"I love this product. I think it's a must-have item for anyone using a shared laundry room. It helps to keep the linens smelling fresh (never a mildew or old machine smell). I like it because it's fresh without being overwhelming.   That said, I use a little less than recommended because I think it might be wearing out my laundry, but I'm not really sure. Also note that this isn't a fabric softener or soap of any kind, just scented dissolvable beads."
5.00,"I bought this and use it with my laundry and the way it makes the clothes smell is amazing. Way better than the liquid Downy. If you want your clothes to smell great get this!"
4.00,"I like my laundry to smell fresh and clean. However, I'm chemically sensitive and sometimes artificial scents really make me ill.  I don't have problems with regular Downy so thought I'd give this a shot and see how it would be                                                                     For some reason I thought it would be a liquid, but its pretty little pellets of scent. When you open the bottle, the smell is STRONG, which is a good thing because that means a little goes a long way!  You can start with just a small amount like a teaspoon and then work you way up. If you like super scented sheets-add more. It was GREAT to get 'dog' smell out of my Chihuahua's dog beds as well.                                                                     It makes the entire house smell clean and fresh when you do a load of laundry, thats an added benefit.                                                                     Overall I think its s good product and really not too expensive for how long it will last."
2.00,"This is supposed to be a scent booster that goes directly into your washing machine with your dirty laundry and laundry detergent. As long as you have a great smelling laundry detergent and fabric softener there is really no need to use this. I tired it without using the fabric softener sheets after the end of a wash and the scent did not last very long. Drying my clothes with my bounce sheets actually last a lot longer than this did. Save your money and get a really nice good laundry detergent that you like the smell of and fabric softener/sheets."
5.00,"Smells amazing! Will always use in my laundry . Well worth the money and extra effort of using ! Love it"
5.00,"Oh how I love this product. Doing laundry right now and it just smells wonderful and fresh. Highly recommend! Also doesn't irritate my fairly sensitive skin surprisingly."
5.00,"Our clothes smell great for weeks after washing. It's such a refreshing feeling to pull an item from the drawer or closet and get a whiff of a pleasant fragrance, even if the item hasn't been recently laundered."
1.00,"Does anyone care about buying a misspelled product? There doesn't seem to be a pun, so it looks more like a lot of quality control went by the wayside and if they can't even spell a word right on their packaging, are they being conscientious about what goes inside?"
4.00,"This is one of the very best products on the market. Sadly though, it's far too expensivefor me to use!"
5.00,"I make homemade laundry Detergent and am happy to find these to scent it with. They smell wonderful. I heated mine slightly to melt them in the microwave for ease in blending, and my kitchen smelled wonderful all day"
5.00,"This one is the very best!! The scent is retained until you wear it again!! Can't ever be without it!!"
5.00,"I love this scent. I have also tried the fresh scent but this one is the best. I mainly use this for blankets sheets and towels. If it was cheeper I would add this to everything. My sheets still smell wonderful a week later when I take them off."
5.00,"I got two free samples of the Downy fresh scent (blue one) and I was a little hesitant to use it since people said theirs left residue, etc. So I decided to try the first sample on a load of towels because who cares if you ruin towels, right? The towels usually get a funky closet smell after sitting in the linen closet for a long time. My towels STILL smell really amazingly fresh and I catch a whiff of them every time I open the closet. There was no residue on them whatsoever either. I've even used my shower towel for a week and I can still smell the Downy unstoppable smell on the towel, even after so many uses.   I figured maybe I just got lucky so I tried the second sample on a blanket that the dog uses and smells like dog butt. Surely nothing can cover the smell of stinky wet dog tush. Well, Unstoppables did it again. I am currently curled up under a fluffy, fresh-smelling, warm blanket fresh out of the dryer and my dog can't have it back anymore. He likes the smell too because as soon as I put the blanket on the bed while I folded some other clothes, he flopped around on it and rubbed his face in it and wouldn't get off the dang blanket when I wanted him to. No weird residue on the blanket either.   I don't know how the other scents are but I recommend sticking with the blue one. It's a lovely fresh smell and it really sticks to the laundry. This blanket gets daily use and I look forward to it smelling fresh and keeping the living room smelling fresh (BIG Downy smell, tiny apartment) for a while!"
5.00,"Never thought I'd buy this. When it came out, I thought it was expensive and that I wouldn't use it. But I received a sample in the mail and I couldn't wait to get to the store to buy some. I have already recommended it and have a few friends using it now as well. WELL worth the money!"
5.00,"Great product for laundry. Smell really good the laundry after cleaning. Its a little bit expensive, you can find cheaper ones... but for the one can pay it, its perfect"
5.00,"But the scent is very nice and it makes me feel good about how I do my laundry. I'm unsure about the duration of the fresh scent but it does smell nice when removed from the dryer..."
5.00,"I have been using these pearls for a few weeks now and I adore them, recently I had a friend over and in a rush I pulled a tee-shirts out from my closet on a Saturday so I could be presentable after cleaning all morning , I washed that tee on Monday, my fried walked in an hugged me and asked if I just did laundry because it smelled so good, funny thing is that I just threw this on but I did use the pearls on this when I was pouring the detergent, they make everything smell lovely and feel soft . Very easy to use, just dump into washed when you add liquid and expect extra soft scent and luxurious hand feel, I will be getting more when I run out for sure! It makes anything you wash with it smell soft and clean, very nice waterlily scent for a hectic lifestyle or for anyone who likes a little something extra nice in their laundry."
1.00,"I bought this product after watching it's very nice commercial but it came out sooooooooo bad. I don't recommend this product to anyone because it is expensive as well doesn't work at all. It doesn't smell anything. I am highly disappointed."
5.00,"Got this for my laundry, new product and love this scent. This scent lasts a long time and does make clothes smell fresh even weeks later. Yum ! !"
2.00,"I enjoy Downy products and like a fresh light fragrance in my wash -  this Downy Unstoppable Fresh Scent Booster was overpowering and over the top for me."
4.00,"One thing I dislike is to grab a towel out of the cupboard a week or so after washing it, and finding that the fresh, just-washed scent is no longer there. Yeah, the towel is clean and I can still use it, but it's just not as enjoyable.                                                                     With Downy Scent Booster, I can grab that towel, even a week or more later, and it will still smell like it just came out of the dryer. I love that!                                                                     It's also nice to know that I can give my laundry and extra boost of \"freshness\" when I'm washing things like work clothes or sneakers....things that are generally a little more smelly in the wash.                                                                     It's not an \"essential\" buy, but something that, if you can afford it, is a nice indulgence."
5.00,"I got this from Amazon Vine a few weeks ago, and I used it right away. You could totally smell a difference!! My clothes and towels smelled wonderful after using this product. The only bad things i can think of would be that it was a very small amount for $11.00 dollars, like maybe five or six loads of laundry. I would def buy this again, though not from amazon (price is way too high)."
4.00,"I just recently used  my sample of \"Unstopables\" I like them but to be honest they kind of smell like men's body wash. The sample packet said it was for 1 load. THANKFULLY I did not put the whole thing in the load, just using 1/4 of it and after the clothes came out of the washer the scent was overpowering to me. I wish the scent would be less cologne smelling and more of a \"softer freshness\". I would use these for sheets or bath towels, but not for my everyday clothes. Since I'm a woman I wouldn't want someone 3 feet away to think I had put on men's cologne."
5.00,"I've used these awesomely scented little things for about 2 years now. They are decently priced and make our laundry smell TOTALLY WONDERFUL!!!"
5.00,"I use this in my homemade detergent all the time. Lush is my favorite scent. Very perfumy and clean. I love highly scented laundry and this does it every time."
5.00,"I have fallen in love with this product after using them on my boyfriends socks. I am always telling him \"you need new socks\", the smell would never come out. Then if i leave them in the washer overnight and I forget to put them in the dryer they would smell even worse. Ever since I got these I can leave clothes for 2 days without smelling like mildew. This is the ONLY thing that will get the smell out of socks. i couldn't believe how good the socks smelled afterwards even my boyfriend was amazed. Now I just need to find them a little cheaper though amazon would be my best bet... doesn't seem like it though."
5.00,"Well, I don't know why Amazon lists this as a stain remover also, it doesn't do that - lol - but it is TERRIFIC at making my clothes smell wonderful. You use this in the washing machine in your normal wash cycle; it's easy, they dissolve completely. No staining or residue that I have detected. Highly recommend."
5.00,"After my daughter was born I noticed that laundry detergents were too harsh for her skin, so for the past 11 years we have been using All Free &amp; Clear detergent. It gets our laundry clean but my I miss smelling the fresh scent on my clothes from using regular detergents. I have been using dryer sheets for my loads of clothes, but the scent wears off quickly.              I decided to give the Downy Unstopables a try. I bought the Fresh Scent booster. I used about 12 beads from the bottle and LOVED the smell of my clothes as they came out of the dryer. The scent lasts all day! The bottle lasts a long time since you only need 12 beads or so per load.              Now I am able to get the scent I love on my clothes and continue to use the free &amp; clear detergents on all our laundry to protect my daughters skin. It is much easier to use the same detergent and then add the Downy Unstopables to my loads than to have two big bottles of detergent in the laundry room - and the scent is much better! (Also I will add that I my daughters skin had not been bothered by the Downy on my clothes - she is only effected by long term contact to detergents. I am not sure how it would effect others with sensitivities to laundry detergents.)"
5.00,"This is my favorite unstoppable smell, and I can't find it anywhere else. The blankets come out smelling clean and it just brightens the whole room with the fragrance."
4.00,"the smell doesn't last long in clothes but in sheets, pillow, towels, smell lasts a long time. also makes the dog beds smell really good and keeps everything soft and totally static free. i can't live without them now."
1.00,"I was looking and just to let you know it is cheaper at walmart $5.99 just alittle info so go to walmart or Publix it is also $5.99"
4.00,"I like the product - just wish I didn't go through so much at a time. Will need to replenish this product on a monthly basis."
5.00,"I have cats and no matter what I do I can always smell them on my clothes. Once I started using Unstopables the smell is gone and they stay fresh. Just gives the clothes an added boost of freshness"
5.00,"I love the smell of these. I do think it's a little expensive but I'll still buy it because it smells so good and makes my laundry smell great."
5.00,"This is one of my splurge purchases. I make my own laundry detergent with washing soda, fels naptha, borax, baking soda, and oxiclean. I find that that is a cheap, but great laundry solution for a big family. However, I want the \"clean laundry\" smell that my homemade detergent doesn't give me. I LOVE the Downy Unstopables--it just smells like luxury. Also, sometimes if I leave my clothes in the basement too long after washing and folding (too lazy to carry up stairs sometimes, lol) then get a musty, basement smell to them, but I find that when I use the unstopables, they keep the \"fresh laundry\" smell for almost 3x longer than just normal detergent/fabric softener."
5.00,"I love this product. The lush scent smells amazing, kind of a lavender/floral scent. I wish downy would sell a room refresher in this scent!! The product is easy to use, you can use as little or as much as you want in your wash and it leaves a lasting scent. Love it."
5.00,"I only use the downy unstopables on our bath towels, it makes them smell so fresh! Nothing like stepping out of the shower and wrapping yourself in a fresh fluffy towel, that smells GREAT!"
5.00,"Great buy, a little cheaper than buying in the stores and it come right to your door. You can't beat it."
5.00,"I would recommend the Downy Unstopables In Wash Fresh Scent Booster...I would buy again...Love the smell.....Its easy ,just fill cup up and dump into washing machine... Add first before the clothes... Jackie :)"
4.00,"I just starting using this and I love the freshness of my clothes, I will buy this product again."
4.00,"So for some reason this scent is never on sale at Walmart or any other store we can find it (not even all stores carry this one). Amazon's price on this stuff is better than the normal prices (but no better than sale prices for the other scents)."
5.00,"I really like this!  I actually put it into the washer before the clothes, and it gives my laundry room a nice scent.                                                                     It certainly isn't for people who don't want a scent on their clothes. If you do, you'll like the nice fresh scent from the product.                                                                     It lasts a long time, because a little goes a long way. You can also use this quality to choose how much scent you add.                                                                     The one disadvantage I see is an absence of softening agents. In other words, this is a perfume, not a fabric softener. So, you'll have to use something else for that, and their scents might conflict.                                                                     Recommended.                                                                     Sean P. Logue, 2011"
5.00,"My Mother has irritable bowel syndrome and her clothes and bedding get to smell real bad even though I wash them and use fabric softener. I tried this and it takes the smell out of her clothes and bedding."
5.00,"This is similar to lavender scent.  Though I'm currently on a lavender kick such as the Mr. Clean Lavender cleaner.  I like this on my sheets but I skip it for the pillow covers for fear it would be too strong near the head.  I enjoy my clothes smelling so fresh when I put them on in the morning.  I do with the price here on Amazon was lower. Perhaps they will offer a subscribe and save soon."
1.00,"I was highly disappointed, I couldn't smell anything, I smelled more when I used Bounce dryer sheets. I used a full cup as well, and the smell was only there when wet, once dry, the scent went away. I am editing this because apparently the blue seems to work and smell more and better than the purple...haven't tried the blue yet though...as for the Lavender...couldn't smell a thing."
5.00,"I received a sample of these and tried them out, while I am not a fabric softener user at all. Turns out I have decided I can't live without it now. After a week my sheets still smell amazing!!! So good!"
5.00,"I love the unstaoppables. I love the smell and it does not bother my skin , Excellent product would recommended to a friend or family member highly. Excellent price cant beat it!"
4.00,"Downy Unstopables is a great product, and works well. The only reason I only gave it 4 stars is because it has a higher price than other brands. The little \"pellets\" really make a difference in my laundry, and the scent lasts at least a week. For some reason I can't buy this product at my local grocery store--they don't have any shelf space for new laundry products."
1.00,"SMELL IS SO LIGHT USE AN ENTIRE BOTTLE PER WASH AND DO NOT EXPECT IT TO LAST FOR ANY AMOUNT OF TIME. PAYING THIS KIND OF PRICE FOR A PRETTY BOTTLE IS NOT ENTERTAINING."
1.00,"I've purchased this from the store and in all honesty, I cannot say that this product is at all worth the money -$6.97 large, $4.97 small/med (called \"Tester). I've tested it using a little (as the bottle says) to double the amount (over what the bottle says) to half a bottle use, then in the last experiment, to whole bottle use. The Experiment: As for washing/drying: (cold water in washer, high heat in dryer) - during the experiment, laundry deg without perfumes used. No dryer sheets or other perfumes were used. Experiment did over a course of 2 weekends. With 3 to 4 medium loads of laundry each for 3 adults. Usual clothes, nothing outlandish. I used $4.97 (tester) for 1st weekend, then $6.97 start of 2nd weekend, then another $6.97 for last (had a coupon) - two different smells. Washer and dryer are both 3 years old, but not HE. Reason: I wanted to see if it really did as it claimed, because to me, just looking at it, it wouldn't, without using other products alongside it. 1st weekend) Using the first small amount as the bottle says (half cap), in it's directions, did nothing for the clothes but left a small hint, probably not even noticeable by some, once washed. I was used to the smell while moving the clothes to the dryer, so it was gone before I even started the dry cycle. Once fully dried, the smell was gone. 1st weekend) Using the first small amount then a little more, such as half of the first small amount (almost full cap, but not completely), will do the same thing as the first. Leave a small hint of smell. Once dried, it's gone. 1st weekend) Using double the amount as the first (one whole cap full then half cap) left the smell in the clothes once washed, but once dried, nothing, it was gone. Completely. 2nd weekend) Using one whole cap, plus another in the wash (2 caps full), left smell long enough to move to dryer, but once dried, nothing, once again. Downy Unstopables In Wash Fresh Scent Booster 13.2 Oz New bottle - used half. 2nd weekend) Using half the bottle in the wash, leaves smell on clothes. Left some white hue on some clothes. Not all of the product was dissolved in the washer. Found some on clothes and in the washer itself. Once dried, left a hint. Downy Unstopables In Wash Spring Scent Booster Laundry Fabric Softener, 13.2 Ounce New bottle - used full bottle. 2nd weekend) Left clothes smelling like bottle fragrance once washed, but also left a small white cloud hue on some. Came off with wet wash cloth or another washing, if it were bad (only had 2 that were bad). Only noticeable on non-white items. Just like before, some of the product didn't get dissolved in the water. Some was found on stick on the clothes and in bottom of washer, either laying there or stick to the sides. Had some hint of smell once dried. Smell lasted about 25 to 30 minutes while folding. Checked to see if towels were still smelling the next day about an hour or so after, had a hint, but didn't last long as the bottle claims, which is until your next wash. Smell was gone by the next day. Did not even leave the closet smelling nice, like when I use Bounce. My conclusion: The product smells really nice (all do; depending on your senses) while still in the bottle. I believe they'd work well for making your closet, bathroom or any small place smell nice, for a couple of hours - not days. It does not remove odors. To get any hint of smell after wash and dry, you literally will have to do what Downy is marketing, which is \"mix and match scents\" and products - which to me, is a lot to spend every time you do laundry. So all in all, a waste of money by itself. You would literally have to purchase Tide deg (owned by P&G), Unstopables (owned by P&G), Downy fabric softener (owned by P&G) and then Downy/Bounce dryer sheets (owned by P&G) for the smell to stick around longer, and the smells would have to \"match\". Hope my experiment helped someone :) a little side note.. their spelling of Unstopables; is just... *sigh*"
5.00,"My daughter told me about this product. I've always been a Downy Fabric Softener user. I love the smell and the way the clothes and towels feel soft. Adding Downy Unstopables to my laundry regiment just increased the clean smell of my laundry. I use it for every load and have recommended it to several people already!"
4.00,"I make my own laundry detergent but needed something to make it smell better and these work amazingly. They smell SO good and with a family of four this bottle lasts a good amount of time. They are a little bit more than I wanted to spend but you can almost always find a $1 off coupon for these which make it a little better."
5.00,"Right so I've used other versions of these scent boosters from other brands, and I've liked them just fine. In particular, I've used the other brands both directly in my washer with store-bought laundry soap and in my own homemade laundry soap recipe. I've found that the other brand (Purex) worked well in my homemade soap, but didn't do so well with the store bought detergent - it just didn't last long enough. That wasn't the case at all with these Downy Unstopables! A little bit goes a long way with these, which is great because they're a little bit pricier than their competition. Bonus: the scent lasts a very long time! My closet smells fantastic after using these. I've tried a few of the Downy Unstopable scents and the Glow scent is my favorite. It smells clean without smelling chemically or fake."
5.00,"nothing wrong w/ my orders pretty much ever.... it cleans..i love not having to drive to the store.. saves me a trip!"
5.00,"I first tried a one wash sample pack that came on a bottle of Tide and after getting half way through my first bottle I LOVE it. My husband and I workout everyday and get really sweaty but I only do laundry once a week. All that sweat sitting on our clothes for 2-6 days was starting to set in but I didn't want to do laundry more often. This is totally saving us. This get's those stinky marinated in sweat clothes super fresh every wash and even after a workout you can still smell a faint trace of the product. I never use more than half a cap full no matter how much freshening I need.I love it. It is now a laundry must half."
5.00,"This is the best thing to add to your laundry. The good smell last for weeks. Try it, you will like it. GP"
5.00,"This really gives a lasting fragrance to clothes but it is quite pricey. I alternate between this and cheaper version (which is good but not as good as this). Walmart does have the price I have found so far, even using coupons."
5.00,"This is great but the product needs to be added to detergent so as to not add another bottle to landfill."
5.00,"If you love for your laundry to smell super fresh, this is the product for you. I originally purchased this at the market and fell in love with the scent. However, I did not fall in love with the price... So glad I found this bargain on Amazon. I bought 2 for under 7$ each. At the store, its 8$ and some change. Some places even higher. Will be purchasing from here,  from now on."
1.00,"I stopped using this product once I started having skin irritations resulting from my my clothes in this product. Not recommended."
5.00,"I thought washing my husbands fishing clothes was a lost cause. No matter how much detergent I used it was no use, they still came out stinking of bait and dead fish. Then I received a sample of unstoppables in the mail and thought, what the hay, can't hurt to try. Man am I glad I did!! I was able to put my nose right on the fishing clothes and not gag lol. They smell amazing! I will definitely be adding this to my laundry musts. I tried the fresh sent but am looking forward to trying the other scents as well."
5.00,"THE PRICE WAS RIGHT AND THIS ITEM SMELLS SO GOOD."
1.00,"used the unstopables in my HE washer and they did not dissolve and left little grease looking spots on my comforter and pillow cases. Will not be using this again!"
4.00,"This is little beads of scent that you pour right into your wash water then add your detergent.  I would suggest you use 1/2 cap full to start.  Then when I toss clothes in the dryer, I use unscented/hypoallergenic dryer sheets as my preference...seems to work out better because you are getting a scent from these beads. The scent doesn't seem to be a problem with my allergies, maybe because it was washed in the fabric and not dryed in from the dryer.  After a few loads of laundry, I have decided to use these for certain items, like that blanket for the back of the couch, or our jackets, and some seasonal clothing that I am presently washing before storing for next season.  I think it is too costly for everyday clothing that I will put in the hamper at night."
5.00,"Simple to use, works great. Just sprinkle a little in each load of laundry, and the scent is evident on the laundry coming out. It doesn't smell perfumy, just fresh."
5.00,"I got a sample of this product when I last purchased Tide liquid detergent. I used it almost immediately and I am so impressed!! My washer &amp; dryer are on my garage and not only did my garage smell like 'Fresh Scent' Unstopables, so did my entire house! My clothes smell so fresh and crisp I just can't get over it. The package said for the ultimate experience to combine the unstopables with liquid downy, which I did not do. I can't imagine how amazing it would be if I had done that!                                                                     I also reviewed this product on my blog: &lt;...&gt;"
4.00,"I have been using these with my el-cheapo washer for months now. Works really well on the washers that don't have the separate softener compartment ."
5.00,"I'm constantly washing my clothes between working out and wearing scrubs at the hospital. Those are smells that I do not want left on my clothes! Downy did a great job in creating this product."
5.00,"I love this laundry scent booster. I've tried one other, which did not have the lasting effect that Downy Unstoppable did. I can take my clothes out of the closet, or a drawer weeks later and they still smell fresh like the scent! Ahhh! Please, try this, it's the best thing to ever happen to laundry! I haven't tried the purple or pink versions yet, but soon will."
4.00,"Target deals<br/><br/>Tide Pods 35 ct or Gain Flings - $9.99<br/>Buy four, get two 9.7 oz Downy Unstopables or Gain Fireworks... http://t.co/EqvJJ8Rycn"
5.00,"I LOVE THESE! The smell is phenomenal, it lasts until I have to wash again. I don't have to use any body spray or anything to cover up the \"dryer smell\" because all you can smell is the unstopables. They should be cheaper, but we will deal. Coupons help that."
4.00,"Smells wonderful but doesn't last but only a couple weeks. It's still worth the smell though! Haven't tried any other brands to compare it to yet."
5.00,"Keeps clothes smelling fresh and clean for weeks! How I ever got along without it before is beyond me! !"
5.00,"I absolutely love the green unstoppables. The smell is amazing and lasts a long time. Even though I'm a smoker people still smell the unstoppables rather than my smoke. Thanks downy for keeping my families clothes fresh!"
5.00,"Love this Downy product. It really works and last 2-3 weeks after the wash. It also is so easy to use just put it in the washer before you put your clothes in to wash."
5.00,"I use this product in my washer The scent is fabulous and my clothes come out smelling great...would recommend this to every one."
5.00,"One of my sons came home from college and as he was passing me I smelled something wonderful. I said what smells so good and he told me about unstopables. Best thing ever!!!!!!! I use it now all the time!"
4.00,"These Gain Flings and Downy Unstopables got my laundry rm and clothes smelling sooooooo good."
5.00,"My family loves these scent boosters. I use fragrance free laundry products with the exception of these beads, and the scent lasts for weeks. My kids especially love it when I use this on their sport uniforms as the smell releases more as the fabric warms up."
1.00,"The tiny beads do not all dissolved. I found pieces attached to my clothing, especially sweaters. I prefer the liquid vesion."
5.00,"We live and work on a dairy farm and our work clothes get filthy dirty and smelly. When I add a capful of this into my hot wash water with my favorite Era detergent it makes even our dirtiest work clothes smell great. When I'm doing a load of laundry or drying a load, I can even smell this throughout my house.                                                                     I now love to walk into my closet as when I walk in I can smell the great fresh scent of Downy. It makes all your clothes smell so fresh and clean. Besides getting the dirtiest, smelliest work clothes smelling great, it's especially great for getting towels and bed sheets snuggly fresh.                                                                     The container this is in is really user friendly. It has a removable measuring cap on top and a snapping cap on the bottle. You can use as much or as little of this as you want. For our dirtiest clothes I use almost 3/4 of a capful. For our other clothes and towels I use only 1/4 of a capful. The bottle looks deceivingly small, as this lasts through several washes. It doesn't take much of this at all to get averagely soiled clothes smelling great. I love the way my clothes smell if I use fabric softener during the rinse cycle, but, I usually too busy to put it in most of the time. So, I love that I can add this at the BEGINNING of the wash before I add the clothes and I get a better than fabric softener scent.                                                                     I absolutely love this and will definitely be repurchasing and making it a staple in my laundry room. Awesome stuff! I hope they will come out with new scents as well."
5.00,"My husband it retired and does a lot of different sports. Sometimes his clothes need a little extra help. The price so far is the same as in the store."
5.00,"I received a sample of this in the mail. Once I tried it I love the fresh smell. All my clothes and linens smell so nice. Its like sleeping on a bed of flowers."
4.00,"I love the light scent of lavender in this product, but oh what I wouldn't do for Tide to bring back my beloved Simple Pleasures line. It's been years since I've been able to buy a bottle of the Lavender and Vanilla scent, but I still think about it. Just keep hoping the execs at P&G will either bring it back, or something very similar. I know the demand is there."
5.00,"this really makes doing the laundry a little bit better. I love the way that the clothes feel and how they smell while using this product."
3.00,"I like my clothes to smell clean, and by clean I mean a light fragrant scent that lasts a bit which makes this seem a perfect fit for me. Unfortunately, it's too strong, and at this point I am using very little, well below what is suggested. I find the little round bits to be a bit of a pain too, but I use a front loader. I put them in ahead of time now because otherwise you're watching them bounce off the clothes onto the floor. One word of caution for pet owners and around kids, these things look like little hard candies. Just be cautious about dropping them anywhere."
4.00,"I washed a shirt for a friend before I sent it as a gift, and got compliments on how good it smelled. I'd say that's a win. I love that sheets and towels smell nice and fresh with these."
5.00,"He used the downy unstopables in wash fresh scent booster 13.2 oz first 2 months ago. Live in venezuela and here in my country, not sold, so buy box of 6 units can be stored without having to worry to finish this product. Downy unstopables in wash fresh scent booster 13.2 oz, left m clothing with a aroma impresionanate, with only a small amount, with soap and use it as a deodorant. Any rncon hecharlo in may (hidden) in your home to your environment deodorizes. Elimnando odors germs and leaving your environment with a real fresh aroma ... Recommend it 100%...I LIKE"
5.00,"While I don't use it often as it's a tad on the pricey side, I love to use this for towels and sheets. It gives a level of freshness that is unmatched by detergent and a dryer sheet alone. It's not overwhelming but, it is definitely there. Being that it's used in the washer (versus the dryer) makes it just as easy to use as it would be if you were putting it in the dryer. Additionally, I like that it's kind of 'use what you need' kind of product. I've figured out that with the large bottle of Unstopables, I can use about a quarter cap-full on a load of towels to achieve my desired level of scent. One warning -- if you want to hang on to the scent through the drying cycle, don't cook the article(s) in the dryer. I like to pull things out when they have just a bit of dampness left. Otherwise, by cooking them dry, I think you drive off the scent. Two huge thumbs up from this guy... will definitely buy again!"
5.00,"love this it makes every thing you wash smell so good.and it last for weeks try it and you will fall in love with it to"
5.00,"This is the most wonderfully pleasant smell on bed sheets, towels and blankets. I love laying my head down on my pillow at night and smelling the gentle, sweet lavender scent. I absolutely always wash my robe and favorite pjs with it too. I could breathe this stuff in all day long!"
5.00,"I LOVE this product. It is a bit cheaper on Amazon than in grocery stores if you are buying it as an add on. I love this scent in particular and also use it in my candle warmer. The scent stays with you for awhile and makes clothes smell fresh. Highly recommend!"
5.00,"I used the sample of Downy Unstopables and just loved it! However, I have been looking in various stores, Publix, Wal-Mart, Sam's, and I can't find it. So I bought the Purex brand . I think Downy was a bit slow on the roll out. Gave out the samples, people went looking for the product , and it couldn't be found. I won't waste my time looking for it. I'm satisfied with the Purex brand product."
5.00,"I've become addicted to certain scents and these really work. I hang all my clothes to dry, I never use a dryer. Proud to say in fact. A sprinkle is all I use so last a long time. You do not need a capful. And the scent does last a long time."
5.00,"The first time I smelled this product was when my upstairs neighbor used it and the smell came wafting through my condo. I went upstairs and asked my neighbor what that wonderful smell was. I have not been without this product since. My sheets, towels, clothes, everything in my home smells wonderful all the time now. All my company comment on the wonderful way my condo smells, which is a good thing considering I share my home with furry friends. The great lavender smell lasts from washing to washing. I love crawling in bed or wrapping myself in towels after ​a shower. I have always loved Downy, but this is their best product ever. I no longer have to watch my washer for cycles, or clean out the gum from the dispenser. This product is one that I will no longer live without."
5.00,"I use this as often as I can with my clothes. I like all the Unstopables scents, but this one is my favorite. I like that I can use a few little pellets or the whole capful depending on the level of scent I want in my clothing. Makes my comforters and sheets smell heavenly. I use less on my clothes for a subtle fresh scent. Definitely recommend the 19.5 oz vs the 13.2 oz -- better value for your money! Highly recommended for high efficiency washers -- make sure to put it in the drum!"
5.00,"I LOVE these things! They're a bit pricey to use on every load, I generally don't use them on regular clothes. However I do love to use them on towels and sheets, and my newest love...I use them on curtains. I use a lot, and it leaves my room smelling nice when I rehang the curtains after washing, and the bedrooms smell nice because of the sheets having been washed with these little pellets. I also like that they don't appear to cause any issues with people who are a little sensitive. My husband is sensitive to some detergents and softeners...there doesn't seem to be a rhyme or reason to it at all, some bother him, some don't, and thankfully, these do not! Wonderful...every time I come in the front door I get a slight whiff of the scent as I pass by the front window!"
5.00,"I love, love, love these things ! The smell lasts ! Recently donated some of my daughter's last winters clothes. They STILL had the Unstopable smell. The only thing, I'm stingy with em, always afraid I'm going to run out !"
5.00,"The other reviewer didn't even use the product before giving it a 1 star review. I recently bought this from {common chain store starts and ends with T}. The smell is very strong while in the container, but it's not bad when it's on your clothes. I was mostly concerned that it may leave oil spots or stains on my clothes but my bottle is almost empty and I have yet to have a problem with that. I came on to Amazon to see if I could get a better deal or a bulk discount because I plan on using this forever. It's cheaper to buy it in the store I originally purchased it from. If you're interested, I suggest you pick some up and if you happen to not like the end result, give it to someone else!"
5.00,"I LOVE these. They are expensive, and they really only make your clothes smell good, they don't clean or anything else. That said, I have tried other brands and just am not impressed with them. Everyone comments on how fresh from the laundry my son's clothes always smell, and I love that all day long I can smell the laundry fresh scent. It's perfume for your clothes, and it actually works! I would say it is definitely worth the couple extra dollars to get these instead of Gain or Purex. I couldn't even smell a difference with those two products."
5.00,"I use this stuff with every load of laundry that I do and love that the smell lasts for a long time afterwards."
5.00,"I bought 2 of them for my girlfriend. She loves the Downy Unstoppables! I think it may be cheaper if not the same price in the store but I had gift cards so I went ahead and got it for her. This product makes our clothes smell so good and fresh! I definitely recommend it."
5.00,"It's all in the details of self care...those extra little steps we take to make sure that everything is just right. Downy in-wash Scent Booster is a great product consisting of scent pellets that you can add as little as a single shake, directly to your wash and enjoy fresher smelling laundry long after you've put the clothes away. My favorite is the blue bottle \"Fresh Scent.\""
5.00,"I just got this product and it smells wonderful! My clothes come out of the washer smelling fresh, and I dont have to worry about adding fabric softner to the wash."
4.00,"I like this product. The smell is nice and sticks around for a while. I wish it came in more smells though as one scent gets old after a while."
3.00,"I purchased both the Blue( turquoise - Fresh Sent) and the purple-fiolet ( Lush ) the Blue fresh sent is good , the clothing still smell nice not overwhelming but the Lush sent , I don't smell anything after air drying of my clothing , and I put the cup full , it does not smelled even while washing , maybe old ? well I tried , but still like better the liquid , if you want to try go for the Blue Fresh Sent , cotton t-shirt was smelling more than other mixed fabrics will not order again , waste of money.. go for liquid as there is no 12 weeks of freshens if the clothing don;t smell after wash , nah maybe the BLUE as well but still it is waste"
3.00,"I love the Shimmer scent. It's feminine, but not overpowering. It has a light, citrusy smell. I only gave 3 stars because the scent doesn't seem to last very long, and the product is pretty expensive for something that only scents your laundry and has no other purpose. I smelled other products before purchasing this one, and this is hands-down, the best smelling scent booster I've found. Another reviewer suggested using the beads around the house and in your car as potpourri. While I love the smell, I don't think I will purchase this product again because it really doesn't do anything except smell good in the container."
3.00,"I do like the smell of this however I do not think the scent last for weeks. I knocked off a few star for the smell not really lasting as that is what the product is suppose to do. I am not sure if I am going to continue to buy this or not."
5.00,"These smell wonderful, but can have some trouble dissolving. I've learned that I can really only use these on linens. So I use the liquid Downy for my clothes and unstopables for my sheets and towels. The blue fresh scent is amazing. I can smell it on my linens for weeks! This is much appreciated since my husband is a gross sweaty beast and usually stinks up our sheets even though I swap them out once a week. This scent stays on their all week!"
3.00,"I love the way my clothes smell after using the unstoppables. The price, even on sale, seems to be high. Because of that I don't know that I would buy these again unless they were on sale somewhere and I have a coupon."
5.00,"This is my forever scent from unstopables and really keeps clothes smelling just washed even after 3 months. I havent tried any other brand to compare this to but I feel if its not broken then dont fix it."
5.00,"Ok I love good smelling clothes but most detergent's I've used just don't cut it and I usually buy what's on sale, and right now I have unscented detergent. I picked up a two pack of the fresh scent at a local retail store and first tried these on an average size load of clothes. There are 2 lines on the cap of this product, i don't know if these are meant for measuring or not, as they are never referred too, but I measured to the first, lowest line and dumped in before washing the clothes. Took the clothes out, put them in the dryer and they smelled great. Took them out of the dryer and the smelled great, but not as pronounced as I was expecting. Was a little deflating because I was expecting a more in your face scent experience. I put the clothes away in drawers and went to washing my bed sheets, mattress cover in another load and my flannel comforter after that load.                           In both of those latter loads I filled the cup to slightly more than the second line. Again, the sheets and comforter smelled good but not in your face. I put the bed sheets on and comforter on my bed and went down stairs for the rest of the evening. At this point I wasn't sure if I'd buy the product again because I wasn't wowed. Well I went up to my bedroom later that evening, about 4 or 5 hours later and as soon as i walked in the door I was hit with a fresh smell. It smelled like my whole room had been professionally cleaned. I was amazed! This is especially great considering my master is around 750 sq feet. To fill the room like it did, with such a great scent, I was sold. I took out my pajama pants out of the drawer and those also smelled great! much stronger than when straight out of the dryer. I went to bed thoroughly pleased and smelling a great scent. I woke still amazed at how great the bedding still smelled, even after a night of sleeping in it. Same goes for the pajama pants which still smell great as I type this!                           I love this product and will now use it every time I wash clothes!                           Update 12/27/12. Ok, now fully a week after I washed my bedding and it still smells great! In fact it still makes me room still smell fresh. Totally sold on these!"
4.00,"These allowed the scent to linger quite a long time. I have a washer that, when clothes come out, seems to create a nice smell but by the time the clothes are done in the dryer I have very little scent left unless I put a dryer sheet in.                                                                     These work well at keeping that fragrance alive. Easy to use - scent is quite nice. It can be a bit overpowering but it may just be an adjustment due to not usually having a smell in my clothes (unless I have worked out lol)."
5.00,"Love the smell of these, now will get these on auto delivery, I like how my laundry smells now especially the sheets and towels. Was at walmart and the cashier said she tried the other brand and it's just not as nice. She also tried the dryer ball and that was a terrible decision. Just thought I'd share that."
5.00,"I love the way Downy Unstopables makes my clothes smell. I even washed and packed my bedspread when I was getting ready to move, left it packed away for six months and when I took it out it smelled as fresh as the day I washed it with Downy Unstopables!"
5.00,"I got this stuff and promptly did a load of clothes just to see how well this worked...kind of silly I know but I love to see if stuff works as advertised and needed to do laundry bad! Anyway, this stuff IS really good at making the laundry smell incredible and for a long period of time. The fresh scent is not overwhelming at all, just right so as not to bother sensitive or allergic people. The whole family loves how the laundry just smells so much fresher even though we still use our softner it just gives a nice boost. The towels smell sooo good. Use more for more fragrance and less for well, I think you get it :  Too bad they don't make it for the dryer too!"
5.00,"Makes my clothes smell great. I use about 1/4 of a cap with every load, and it lasts for awhile."
5.00,"I love using these. My clothes come out smelling great and my laundry room smells amazing while I'm doing laundry. I sometimes do laundry just for the smell :)"
5.00,"First and foremost this product works exactly as advertised. You sprinkle a cap full in the wash and it leaves your laundry smelling terrific. Secondly, I read on Pinterest that a woman put some of these little beads in a diffuser that is usually used for essential oils. I ordered this from Amazon and since I don't have a diffuser I pour some into a candle when the was was melted. It smelled delicious!!!! According to Pinterest the beads melt like wax (which was my experience) and form a solid when they get cool. UPDATE: So far the fragrance hasn't caused any skin irritation and we are a family with very sensitive skin!!!"
5.00,"I bought these for my laundry and then read how they can be used for so much more. I have since made small sachet bags for my closets, car and as gifts. I also have placed some in my disposal to air it out and my garbage can. They can be melted by Wax Warmers to put off scent (and are much cheaper than wax bars!) A good buy with so many uses! Very happy!"
5.00,"The 13.2 ounce bottle has been hard to find lately. I am not sure why. The price was good also. I stocked up for me & my mother-in-law."
1.00,"Save your money....doesn't make your clothes smell any better than just using regular ole fabric softener. I tried adding more...then less..results were still the same. Bah humbug."
5.00,"i use this regilously my clothes smell just great..they smell good for at least a week...i would reccommend these to anyone!"
5.00,"We live in Poland and if you didn't know but washing your clothes using local detergent leaves your clothes smelling like sweat and flowers. Use this product and it takes the sweat away! Its a nice refreshing smell from home while living in Europe. Amazon prime sends them right away and I tell you the morale in my house has soared! We absolutely love it! We will buy again and when we get back stateside they will be regular purchases!!"
5.00,"Kudos to Downy for helping the detergents smell even better. The detergent pods don't have as much \"small-good, freshly laundered\" scent as the boxed loose-pak did. Well, this takes care of that problem and is easy to add for the great aroma it has when the laundry is finished."
5.00,"Love this stuff! Have been using it for years, makes all your clothes and linens smell amazing and the scent lasts! This is now a staple in my laundry room."
4.00,"I do like the smell that these things put on my clothes and towels, but I cannot imagine that it would last months like the ads say. Thus, I only get them when I find a coupon. This pink bottle smells the best, in my opinion."
4.00,"I love the idea of adding an extra touch of scent to my laundry, especially for sheets, blankets and towels. Just a sprinkle in the wash and you get an incredibly powerful scent that lasts and lasts. I was amazed at how much scent I got with just a sprinkle. It says to use a capful or less. I recommend just sprinkling a small amount at first, until you see how much you like it. It is very strong! But as someone once said \"Some is ok, some is not alot\". With such a large bottle, I know it will last me a long time. I love having fresh smelling sheets and blankets, so I used a bit more for those items than I did for my clothes. My whole laundry room was filled with fragrance. I would only recommend being cautious if you have any allergies to fragrance. It could be a bit overpowering, that is why only 4 stars.  Much better than fabric softener and scented detergent alone."
1.00,"If it turns out you are allergic to it, you can break out in hives and/or an itchy rash! Both my son and I broke out after using this in our wash. Never again!"
5.00,"I got these free as an online sample at absurdlycool.com and forgot all about it until i accidentally tossed it into the laundromat washer by accident with my clothes.  I was worried I didn't have enough detergent for my large load of clothes that I wear for work but I had already added the detergent in earlier, so even though the washer was stuffed with my large load of work clothes, I added in the sample pouch size of unstoppables.  Afterwards, I found that the pellets REALLY boosted the fragrance of my clothes.                                                                     I was also afraid like other reviewers that these small pellets would stain all over my clothes like detergent that's not mixed in well with the water OR that the pellets would somehow remain in the washer and clothes.  But somehow the pellets disappeared in the cold washer water.                                                                     You don't need a lot for a large boost of fragrance.  I like the fact that the small pellets don't weigh a lot like fabric softener liquid and that they're not messy like detergent powder since I've got a lot of clothes and laundry products already to carry to the laundromat and clean up after.  I can carry a few of these rice sized pellets in a small plastic sandwich bag, use them all up in 3 loads of laundry and then throw away the bag and not have to carry anything back and not have to clean up after these pellets.                                                                     If I see them again at my local Walgreen's or supermarket, I'll be sure to buy them, at least occasionally, even if they are kind of pricey."
3.00,"If you are sensitive to fragrances (i.e. you dread sitting between two ladies on a plane because inevitably one will wear perfume) DO NOT BUY the lush scent. The scent is horribly strong and gives me a headache. It's like being assaulted by one of those perfume shop workers in the mall, once a minute until you can change clothes. I had to wash the clothes twice (with white vinegar added in) to get the smell to a bearable level. Maybe my boyfriend poured in tons since other reviewers can't smell the product? Here's the boyfriends review. I do muay thai, jiu jitsu and judo twice a day 5 days a week. So you can imagine the status of my gis and hand wraps at the end of the week. They are all really thick so even the wet smell on them is annoying. This is the first product thats strong enough to overcome it. Now if ur gf is allergic to it maybe u shouldnt wash all your clothes in it, but otherwise its a good product that gets the job done."
4.00,"I came to Amazon hoping to purchase this product cheaper, and possibly put it on a subscribe and save, only to discover that even using the $2 coupon offered, it is still several dollars more expensive than walmart.  Our walmart offers the exact same weight product for $6.97 which I originally thought was kind of pricey, until I saw Amazon's price!                                                                     As far as the product goes, it really does add such a great fragrance to your laudnered clothes! My husband, who normally doesn't notice anything related to laundry mentioned it and said he likes it! He even said that since I started using it, his co-workers always say that they like the way his clothes smell and that he now has a smell that singles him out from everyone else.  They have even asked him to allow his wife to do their laundry! :D"
5.00,"I love this stuff. It is so easy to throw in the washer.  Scent is great  I would recommend to anyone."
5.00,"I just love this laundry booster...glad that downy came out with it..just what I needed to bring out that clean smell to my laundry and it lasts too."
5.00,"The scent is great in there little tiny pellets. I have used them before and really loved them, I am glad I bought them again. I love the extra refreshing scent they give my clothing, blankets and towels. I do however feel that the scent is not as prominent as when I had first tried them, and I am not the kind to skimp on the amount I throw in with my wash, so I doubt It's just me."
5.00,"The scent from this softener lasts so long! I pulled out some shirts that were washed and tucked away, and they still had a fresh scent to them. They are definitely worth the money."
2.00,"This applies to the lush scent. I may try the fresh scent after reading some glowing reviews.                                              I loved the scent of this, it was on sale &amp; I had a coupon. I'd read reviews about the scent being very strong so used in sparingly in the first load. Nothing. Tried it again and filled the entire cap, as I was doing a big load. Some items had a light pleasant fragrance, others none at all. It seemed that only the all cotton items carried the scent. However it would be far too expensive for me to use it regularly. And after a few hours, the scent is definitely fading. I folded a few t shirts to see if any scent remains in a week or two. It was fun to try it and I may use it on towels and sheets sometimes for a treat.                                              Update: A very mild scent after a week."
5.00,"My towels, sheets and clothes smell fantastic and fresh for weeks after using washing.   I have been using Downy Unstopables for over 6 months. I bought a new washer and dryer for a new home and thoight I would give my beuatiful new machines an extra perk. WOW! WOW! I have been hooked ever since. Admittedly, I do not use much at all. Because I have a new high efficient machine, I do not need much of any product. One bottle of Unstopables lasted about four months and I do about 6-8 large loads of laundry a week. I still use fabric softener and Tide with a touch of Downy and fabric softerner sheets in the dryer. I do not add liquid fabric softener to my laundry when washing towels. So, I have read a few other reviewers mention the additional high cost. It can be fairly negligible if you purchase this on sale and use wisely. The reward to your nose is worth it.   My scent of choice is the lavender (purple). It is a bit more subtle than the most popular blue labeled scent. I enjoy lavendar in many things around the house and use lavendar pillow sprays when I change the sheets to promote restful sleep. Your linen closets will smell wonderful, as will your drawers and traditional closets. This will give your workout clothes an extra perspiration anti-stink fighting boost because they already smell delicious. You will want to bury your face in your towels, pillows and even your kitchen towels, which I think can pick up odors quickly.   The only thing you may want to consider is guests or family members who are sensitive to fragrance and/or perfumes. I teach Yoga and other execise classes at my home. I love washing towels for my Yogi with Unstopables, but I always have a few towels available that have not been washed with extra perfumes.   Enjoy!!"
5.00,"I am a very scent oriented person.  I burn scented candles continually, buy my detergent based on the scent and so on.  When I purchased Downy Unstopables I expected it to do nothing for the quality or care of my laundry except add an extra scent boost and boy oh boy does it ever.  I absolutely love this product.  Sure the price isn't what I would like it to be (my grocery &amp; local stores have it much cheaper than here on Amazon) however I have found myself cutting back on the amount of fabric softener I use since purchasing Downy Unstopables.  When my wash is finished and I put my clothes in the dryer the smell is very strong.  Upon taking them out the scent is not as potent but very very reasonable in my opinion.  I travel alot for work and I find myself pulling items out of my closet last minute to pack and when I take them out of the suitcase or even pull them to wear after they've been there for awhile the scent still remains.  I come from a non-smoking home if that makes any difference.  Your clothes just smell so fresh &amp; clean when you use this product.  I have no hesitation in recommending this product to friends or family (which I have done several times).  Being a scent nut that I am, the price to me is worth it, mind you I am a single person and don't have to do the amount of laundry a family would.  I hope Downy keeps this product on the shelf.  I'd hate to do laundry without it."
5.00,"This is the most amazing laundry product I have purchased in a LONG time! I am a fanatic about clean smelling laundry; some soaps and dryer sheets just do not leave the long-lasting, fresh scent that I am looking for. This, though, does the trick! The best thing about it is that I can control how much or how little I put it. Throw a bunch in with towels and blankets and the smell lasts for weeks! The fresh scent one is amazing and I am eager to try the other scents!"
5.00,"This product is amazing. All my friends and neighbors are hooked on scentables! I love my bed smelling fresh and this product keeps my bed smelling just washed for a week."
5.00,"These little beads are amazing! The smell sticks to laundry like crazy & can last for a couple weeks hanging in your closets! Very satisfied! Highly recommend! Great for those stinky work clothes of men or kids mucky clothes!"
5.00,"Makes laundry smell clean & fresh"
5.00,"I love Downy unstopables they are great for clothes keep the scent and you can use them in wax warmers and make your house smell fantastic!"
5.00,"This product helps laundry smell so good for weeks to come. And, that is saying a lot when the men in your life perspire heavily."
5.00,"I absolutely adore this product. Detergent and softener impart a nice scent, but it usually fades after a day or so. Downy Unstopables give laundry an extra boost of freshness that really lasts. I especially appreciate it on jackets and coats that aren't necessarily washed as often as other items. It's also done very well on the throws in my living room, giving a sense of freshness in the room. The best is that you can determine how much of that fresh scent you want to add.                                                                     I'm a little weird in that I really do enjoy doing laundry, and this is one spectacular product!"
5.00,"This is a bit pricey comparing to other similar products that are double the size for same price or less but the scent is stronger. I think it's more concentrated. I prefer, and ordered the pink bottle, unfortunately Walmart sent me the \"golden\" one (different scent), but not worth exchanging. Scent is not too bad either in the one with the \"golden-beige\" cap. The pink one is more flowery and the scent is not too strong (as in the blue)."
5.00,"I really like downy unstopables, it always leaves my clothes smell so fresh, even after being stored away for the season. I also trust downy products. Thank-you downy, would you please make a larger size, and coupons that do not expire in one month. Thank- you DOWNY!"
5.00,"I just bought the purple one because I live in dorms, and recently after I washed my clothes here, everything just smelt funky and kinda mildew-ey to me.  I couldn't stand my own scent haha. So I decided that this stuff may be my solution.  I chose the purple because I felt the scent wasn't as overpowering as the blue.  It just smelt more subtle.  I'd describe the scent as fresh and warm.  It kind of reminds me of the smell of my shampoo, which I like.                                              So, I love this stuff!  It did exactly what I wanted it to do.  I only put about 1/3 a cup, because I'm usually not one to like really perfumey, strong smells.  This worked perfectly.  It's not too overpowering but I can still notice it.  I honestly can't stop smelling myself! haha, so yes, highly recommended. :)"
2.00,"Thought I would give this a try and frankly I couldn't notice a difference. I prefer just using the fabric softener. Just something else to spend your money on."
5.00,"This is the first product that ever made my husband's work clothes smell fresh. The freshness continues even through the dryer cycle. I am a true fan!"
5.00,"I gave this 5 stars because it does just what it says, fresh scent booster. You can adjust your level of fragrance which is outstanding. When folding clothes, it nice to have that extra freshness. If only clothes could fold themselves. Lol.. Overall Great Product!"
5.00,"This worked great in my high efficiency washer. It is pricey I think, and so it will be up to you whether it is a good value. I vote yes."
4.00,"Love the smell of our clothes when they come out of the dryer with these! This is definitely our favorite fragrance of the Unstoppable line! My only negative is that it's a little pricey for the amount of loads of laundry you get from one bottle."
5.00,"This is a must for any laundry. I use it while deployed here in afghanistan. Makes clothes smell 100 percent fresher than without."
4.00,"This was my first time using this type of product, but i was pretty impressed. The scent wasn't so strong that it burned my nose like other products."
5.00,"This product makes your load smell nice for weeks to a month at a time with only a little needed per wash."
5.00,"If your addicted to pleasant aromas you must try these magical little beads. I always had a hard time knowing when to add softener to my washing cycle. I love these because you put them in with the detergent. They truly do keep your laundry fresh smelling for at least 3 weeks!"
3.00,"I was hesitant, to say the least.  I like a little, mild scent on my laundry, but I don't want it to be overwhelming.  I use all natural detergent, which is all-but fragrance-free.  So I was hopeful that this product would provide a little scent.                                                                     When I sniffed inside the bottle, I knew it would be strong.  The directions state to use how much you want, and I only use a small amount.  1/2 tablespoon, at the most.  I just toss them into my front-load washer and then put the clothes in.  I've never had deposits from the scent booster wind up on my clothing, so I'm quite happy about that.  It seems to rinse away equally well in both hot and cold washes.  And, since the pellets are blue, I was hesitant about it leaving stains, but so far there are no stains.                                                                     I have found a couple of not fully disintegrated pellets inside of my washer here and there, but nothing significant.  Unless you use a large amount and do a lot of laundry, I don't think it will clog any part of your washer.                                                                     As for the scent, a little goes a LONG way.  My small amount I use makes my laundry have a light scent that lasts several days.  It's enough to smell fresh and clean without causing a scent overload.                                                                     The cap secures on well, but it still makes my laundry area smell like it.                                                                     I do like the fact that you can really control how much scent you want.  But I highly recommend starting small and working up."
5.00,"I just throw a small handful of these scented beads into my front loading HE washer after I put the clothes in. They all melt I guess, and leave the clothes smelling really fresh. I use less than the recommended capful and am very pleased with the results. My drawers (of the dresser and in the dresser) smell really good. And it is long lasting. I wear scrubs to work and someone commented on how good I smelled. Since we aren't allowed to wear cologne or smelly lotions at work, they were commenting on my freshly laundered scrubs! Also works wonders on my husbands stinky work socks. Good buy here on Amazon for about 4 bucks. I would never pay the 10+ dollars I have seen it for at the grocery store. Side note -- if you have a front load washer, be sure to check inside the rubber ring for stray beads."
5.00,"This stuff makes your clothes smell great! My wife usually puts less than the recommended amount and yet the clothes still come out smelling fresh and clean."
5.00,"They make all of my laundry smell great and the scent lasts for a long time. Towels and sheets coming out of the closet smell great. I recently handed down some children's clothes and my friend said her daughter loved the smell of them! Highly recommend."
1.00,"(note: Even if it had worked exceptionally well, the product is still extremely expensive)"
5.00,"These are less mess then the liquid and dont have to worry about them in the mail being damaged and leaking everywhere."
2.00,"I used the fresh scent in my towels. I was really impressed while it was washing. It made my whole house smell clean. However, it turned my towels blotchy blue in color. I have a HE washer that automatically does an extra rinse and I as well turned on another rinse since I am sometimes sensative to dyes and scents, so I know rinsing was NOT the issue. I would NOT recommend putting this in with clothes."
5.00,"I had originally got a sample in the mail for this item, and tried it out with my towels. The rest is history, the Fresh Scent really makes the bed sheets and towels smell great for a couple of days. Not sure about 7 days, but maybe for 4 days or so. Plus the fresh scent is not over-powering and has the right balance of scent. I would definitely recommend you try this out at least once, you may not turn back afterwards"
5.00,"We have tried all of the unstopables scents and they are all very nice, but this is our family's favorite. It's a nice, fresh scent and it lasts forever. It's so nice because our clothing and linens smell fantastic even after sitting in the closet or drawers for weeks. Although the scent is long lasting, it's not at all overpowering or annoying."
5.00,"I love the way this leaves my laundry smelling. I would use it more often, but it is a little pricey."
5.00,"I can only ever find this at Target, and am super excited that I didn't have to go to Target to get it, as the nearest Target is really far away. Thank you Amazon for carrying this amazing smelling product!"
3.00,"The product only rate 3 stars as it doesn't quite make it through wash, rinse and dry. Downey is noted for being first class, but my previous order fell short. Wish you luck in the future and hope your next formula meets your reeputation."
5.00,"My laundry has never smelled better. Love this product. Have put this on my subscribe and save items. I have an HE washer that doesn't always smell great. Now my laundry is better than ever and wait until you wash your sheets. OMG. Smells wonderful."
5.00,"I really love the smell of fresh laundry, and the smell of Downy. But many things, like towels and exercise clothes, are not supposed to be washed with fabric softener, because it leaves a waxy coating and plugs up the pores in the fabric, cutting down on absorbency and \"breathability\". I was hoping somebody would come up with something I could use to give these things a lasting clean smell without the softener. Downy Unstopables is exactly what I needed. I've only tried the Lush fragrance so far, but plan to use the others to test them out. I'll probably also use it in addition to softener on all our laundry, because it smells so good, and lasts longer than the fabric softener scent. Also great for sheets and to make the linen closet smell wonderful.                                                                     One thing to keep in mind is that a little goes a long way, so you may only need a sprinkle of the fragrance beads, and not a whole capful. You can go from just a hint of fragrance to a lot, or anywhere in between, depending on how much you use. I don't think I'd want to use a whole capful."
3.00,"After using this a few times in my wash, the smell is kind of like a medicine smell. It smelled good in the bottle but I do not care for it. Everybody has different tastes. I like the Purex brand smells better and they are cheaper. Both the Fresh and the Shimmer just smelled icky to me. I'm sticking with the Purex. It's cheaper, you get more and it smell MUCH better!"
5.00,"I was desperate to find something that would work on my teenagers football gear. NO matter how hot the water, how long the cycle I was never able to get the funky smell out of his gear. On a whim I picked these up and tried them on all the \"normal\" clothes from the rest of the family and it worked wonders. Next came the big test...a washer full of jerseys, socks, under shirts, and leggings. What a wonderful surprise it was to open the washer and do the smell test on these garments. Held my breath and waited for them to dry, no disappointment here either. The product is a little on the steep side, price wise, for our family of 6 but if it gets me through football season its well worth it."
5.00,"This stuff really works. We've been using them for a few months now. Towels really do come out of the closet several weeks later smelling good. I doubt the 5 month claim... but after 5 weeks, towels were still smelling good. Like I say, we keep buying this stuff now instead of using a fabric softener... as this stuff does keep it's scent for a long time."
5.00,"Downyhas always been my favorite scent for my laundry, but only wished the smell would last longer. This definately has made a difference. It has made my whole house smell fresher. My kids feel better about they way their clothes smell. Aparently they didn't smell as good as other kids??? Anyway, we are happy with the product and love getting it shipped to us regularly on our subscribe and save program. It costs me about 5.79 each that way."
5.00,"I love this product and would continue to purchase it at this price and deal. Great smelling clothes and continues to hold the freshness in my clothes and towels. My mother told me to try it and now I dont was without it. Try it you wont want to be without it! Sunshine"
5.00,"Go to Target. It's only $5.99 there! I just saw it there today!  It smells heavenly and you can put as much as you want before you load clothes in wash."
4.00,"If so, Downy Unstopables are for you :) This is not soap or fabric softener, it is like perfume for the laundry. I love the way it smells -- the scent is long lasting but not overpowering."
5.00,"Our clothes smell yummy! I like the gain fireworks and this is just as delightful. So glad I took a chance.."
5.00,"A little goes a long way...this is a great product...in addition t fabric softener, I use it for air freshener in my car. My daughter melts the pellets in a spray water bottle and makes her own Febreeze. I am going to do the same thing!"
5.00,"Laundry smells great. I only use enough to cover the bottom of the cup and my laundry smells great. Will buy again."
5.00,"We use this on all of our loads. They smell great for weeks after and when you open your drawer or closet you can smell the freshness."
2.00,"After hearing so much about this product, I decided to go ahead and give it a try. Who doesn't love to smell the fresh scent of laundry long after the clothes have been washed? Well, I wasn't thrilled with the directions (to use as little or as much as you want). I like being told what works and what doesn't. Otherwise, I'm worried I'll overdo it and waste the product or underdo and waste the product. Well, I tried several different loads of laundry with several different amounts of product in the cup and, while they all have a nice scent, I'm not really sure it smells any better than other products I've used.                                              I felt like this was a bit of a waste of money for me when my other products (Gain especially) do the exact same thing. I'm usually fairly easily amused, but I also really like not wasting money on products that aren't necessary in addition to what you already use."
5.00,"This product is awesome! It leaves the perfecr smell on your clothes without damaging stains. Scent lasts a long time too."
1.00,"I got the bright idea to try this new product. I had a terrible allergic reaction that took me two weeks to figure out that it was from the Downy Unstopables. So I had re-wash all my clothes again, and I have had no problems since. So if you find yourself breaking out in welts that are very red and itchy and your using the Downy stop right away."
5.00,"Finally my uniforms and clothes here in Afghanistan smell like home... I really enjoy my clothes no after the laundry..."
4.00,"I always wondered how some peoples clothes smelled so good . well until i started using the unstopables my fabrics were just plane . now i enjoy having the nice smell of clean laundry ."
5.00,"Love the ease of use - no messy liquids. Has a long lasting fresh scent tat stays on even after the dryer."
5.00,"Used it with my sons football wear and it helps so much. Nothing will get the smell out of his jersey since its old and been worn by how many kids, but this with Tide Active really helps a ton!! Its so easy to just put in the wash and right away you smell how nice it is. Not to overpowering either once the wash is done."
4.00,"These are a nice fragrance but pricey for the amount of laundry I do. I can always just add an additional cap of fabric softener and get the same result. Nice for the clothes to smell nice before the fabric softener cycle but with our water the smell isn't overly noticed after going through the dryer."
3.00,"It smells great when starting in the washer. And it is disappeared after pulling out from the dryer. I compared two loads; one with it and one without, it does not make any difference. It’s not a bad product sine it works for some people but I think it’s a waste of money."
2.00,"Although it bears the Downy name, this product is not a fabric softener, it is simply a \"scent booster\". Not worth the cost just for the scent, in my opinion."
5.00,"Works great especially when combined with the Downy Infusions. My daughter's dance outfits have never smelled better."
5.00,"I used this recently when I washed my blankets and towels, and I was definitely impressed.  Just a small amount (half a capful) was necessary to give my blankets and towels an extra burst of freshness.  The scent is a little bit floral and lasts for a few days.  I put the Downy booster directly into the washer. (Instructions say NOT to put in your dispenser) And it does work fine with high efficiency washers.  I do recommend this for times when you may want extra freshness for your clothes or towels."
5.00,"Tried different scents and just love the way it makes my clothes smell You use it along with your Landry detergent-Wow it really makes clothes smell so good Amber087"
4.00,"The smell could be better, I expected it to be much nicer scent, but when I wash a load with it I will see if it smells better."
4.00,"I live and work in a war-zone. The laundry service here sucks because once it is retuned to me, it has no sent... so adding these sent boosters makes the whole difference. I love it and now tha i have shared \" my little secret\" to my colleagues they will buy some too! I also put some in the cap, and put it in my waredrobe closet, oh it smells great now! :)"
5.00,"I was using the other one, green bottle that the unstopables come in, for about 2 months, and although I enjoy the scent, it was a little too perfume smelling and both of us was not a real fan of it. So I tried this one, purchased through Amazon using the Subscribe &amp; Save program (which is cheaper where I live to do it this way, and I'm factoring gas, time and product cost at T.!) and I'm very pleased. The scent stays in the cloths, even though a workout (that I was surprised about!) and well I'm a fan."
5.00,"Wonderful fragrance NOT too strong but leaves a fresh after scent on all our clothes & towels! I will always buy this stuff!"
5.00,"The scent is wonderful and lingers for at least two weeks"
5.00,"This product leaves my laundry smelling amazing. You pour the little beads into the washer with your detergent and they dissolve leaving a very fresh laundry scent. I use a little more than called for because I found the scent to be a little weaker than I liked with just the capful. The product does not leave any kind of residue on the fabrics taht I could notice. HIGHLY RECOMMEND if you like fresh smelling laundry and if you aren't allergic to scented laundry products. I would not have used this when my children were smaller because they had terribel excema and needed to use scent free products."
5.00,"I fell in love with this product when I used the free sample I got a few weeks ago. I had seen this product on Facenook and was wondering, \"Why is this product such a big deal?!\" When I used the sample at the laundry mat, It's scent filled the air. I instantly was in love. The scent even lasted till the next time I washed my clothes. I'M HOOKED! This product is the real deal and I think its worth every penny because it lasts a long time if you don't over do it. Thank you Downy for this wonderful invention!"
5.00,"I love all the Unstopables...its all I want for Christmas!!!! Actually, my whole family is hooked on these darn things...great stocking stuffers!!"
5.00,"I love these things. And it always a good thing when you can find an online coupon! They are quite expensive in stores."
5.00,"My clothes are fresher when I use this product. This is a very good product and I will be using it for a very long time."
5.00,"Throw out your fabric softner, this is the best stuff ever. and the fragrance lasts and lasts. Only need very little"
5.00,"I buy a few canisters and pour them into a neat lidded glass jar in my laundry room. When I'm in there folding laundry, I open the lid just to get the clean fresh scent in the room. OH, I also use it in my laundry, ha ha."
5.00,"This works great with home made laundry detergent. My only complaint is that I wish the price point was lower."
5.00,"I tried these by accident and wow was I thrilled with the scent which lasts. I can't imagine doing laundry now without these."
4.00,"It works the way it should, it makes your clothes smell awesome! Some friends of mine that smoke in their house use it and they don't even smell bad when they leave their house. For them, a bottle would only last about 4 loads. For me, about twice that. The only problem is it is a little pricey for 8-loads-worth of washes. Couponing would help."
2.00,"It cleans well but I find the scent doesn't last long and it doesn't smell the same as the regular unstopables scent."
4.00,"This product works well to remove or cover (not sure how it works) lingering  odors in the laundry.  This works well for laundry when our  12 year old, occasionally incontinent, dog  suffers a bout of leaking."
3.00,"I got a sample pack of these as a freebie not very long ago, I finally decided to use them today. First, I don't have my own washer, I live in an apartment like complex and have to resort to using their washers. They smell fabulous, they made the whole laundry room smell really good, a fellow neighbor even asked what I was using, so no problems there. What I did have a problem with is that they had not dissolved whatsoever during the wash, leaving little globs of glue like stuff all over my clothes, I had to end up picking each individual one off and hoping the dryer would melt any remainders and NOT stain or ruin my clothes. Now I can't attest that this is a problem with the product itself, or the crappy 80s era washing machine my complex has. The smell also lasted, and was pretty strong, BUT being a lady it would clash with any perfume or body sprays I would use, but I think they'd be really nice to use with towels and blankets. I'd say this product is definitely worth a try, but not if you have a crappy washer!"
3.00,"I had good results with this product, but I found that I received the same amount of fresh scent with this product as I usually do with my fabric softener. Next time I may add a little more to the wash and see if there's any difference, but overall, Unstoppables is nice for an extra scent boost. I don't know if I'd purchase it in the future, but it was nice to try."
5.00,"We love Unstopables in our household. We use them on our sheets and towels, which keep a great scent! Extremely satisfied."
1.00,"I got this mainly to use with sheets, towels, and my workout clothes. once home, I opened it and sniffed- not much of a scent, but I figured maybe it was released in the water. Washed the first load using about half a cap full of the product. I barely noticed the scent when I opened the washer at the end of the cycle. Once the sheets were dry...nothing. Tried it again, this time using a whole cap full of the pink pellets. Same thing again. No scent on the towels, at all! It's not just me- my husband can't smell it, either. This is a waste of money. I won't be buying this again and I'll certainly be wary of Downy products."
4.00,"I love this scent! Makes the clothes smell good for months. It doesn't last long though. It can easily be gone in about five loads."
5.00,"These are my new favorite, they make your clothes smell so good! If you haven't tried them you should, they are great!"
5.00,"My sister asked for these for Christmas, I purchased every scent Walmart offered, she loves them and says its the best scent for wash! Personally, I have not tried them but I shopped around, Walmart had the best price, most scents and free shipping which meant no use of time in a car and gas."
5.00,"Made clothes smell fresh and clean. Easy to use. Great product overall. I will use this again and again. I give this an A+++"
2.00,"When I first tried this product on my sheets I LOVED LOVED LOVED it!! My entire bedroom smelled AWSOME! The second time it was ok too on my towels, but thereafter the scent all but vanished. I use an HE front loader washer and at this point I really smell nothing different in my clothes/sheets even if I were to dump half the bottle in there! WHY? Is there some buildup going on in there that doesn't give me that awesome scent anymore? Now I just smell it very faintly but believe me it is NOTHING like it was at first. Anyone know why? I'd really LOVE to get that scent back. I've tried cleaning my machine as well numerous times with no change, I still can't hardly smell it anymore. The two stars is only because it was GREAT for the first couple washes, but I won't spend that kind of money anymore since it doesn't work for me anymore."
5.00,"I love Unstoppables because I (sometimes) have a bad habit of leaving laundry in the washing machine overnight almost always resulting in a musty smell and having to wash them again. Unstoppables eliminates the need to rewash! Keep in mind, this is NOT a fabric softener. It is just as it says \"in-wash scent booster\" and you should still use fabric softener when using Unstoppables. I do not like the regular price of this product in stores, but when purchased using coupons, it lessens the pain a little. I recently stocked up (bought 8 jars) at a wholesale club using their store coupon as well as manufacturing coupons and only paid about $3 a bottle. PS Due to how expensive this stuff is, I do NOT fill the entire cup. I usually go about 1/2 way (even less if it's my kid's clothes) and still get great results. I also use a little less fabric softener too now. (I used to always fill the cap all the way to the top just to get a stronger scent)."
5.00,"Best smelling out of the 3 scents offered by Downy. Does what it says it's supposed to do. Will buy again"
4.00,"This scent takes a little getting used to. If anyone is like me and is trying to decide how big 50oz is, it's the tiny one!! I overpaid bigtime after shipping charges! I should have just gone to KMart! And I will in the future."
5.00,"If you enjoy aromatherapy and smelling like incense, this product will do you well. Somehow this product penetrates the clothing fibers and leaves clothes smelling fresh and clean. I do my laundry in the damp basement, and sometimes the clean clothes can have a slight must scent despite my best efforts. I have had nothing but fresh smelling laundry since I started using this product. It does exactly what it claims, and it does it well."
4.00,"I make my own laundry detergent which has no scent. I missed that \"clean laundry smell\" that permeates the house when I'd do the piles of laundry. This particular scent, \"Fresh Scent\" is refreshing! It keeps the clothes smelling good for a few days and gives the closet or drawer of clothes some freshening too. Just be sure to not use too much as it will overwhelm when you want to wear perfume/cologne. The directions are sketchy when it comes to top-load HE washers. Put it in before the clothes? After the clothes are loaded? I've tried both and it seems to make no difference but I feel more comfortable putting the booster in last thing as my washer pumps all the left over water out of the tubs before starting the wash cycle.Does it make a difference, probably not LOL."
5.00,"Used as directed, these little pellets make your clothes smell better. To me the scent is a little overpowering at first (that happens with any laundry product for my nose) but when the clothes are done washing it's not too strong. At first I thought that this was just another fabric softener but you actually add it in the wash cycle as the title implies. I like this scent although I actually prefer the purple scent called Lush that smells like lavender. I got that one at Wal-Mart and I'm not sure how much I paid but it was most likely less than what is being charged here. At a cheaper price you should definitely try this and the other scent."
5.00,"I use these EVERY time I do laundry. It makes my clothes smell wonderful. Will be using this brand a LONG time."
5.00,"Front load washer necessities! Keeps the gross smell out of my front load washer and keeps my clothes fresh and clean smelling!"
3.00,"I was really anxious to try these because I love the smell of regular Downy and was excited about a product that would keep my clothes smelling that way longer.  Unfortunately both of the scents that the Unstopables comes in currently are different smelling than original Downy.  I tried the wash fresh scent.  It's clean smelling and fresh, but it's a bit too strong for me.  I used about a half of a cap the first time and about a quarter cap the second and both loads were a bit too strong smelling for me.  If they had this in the original Downy scent, I'd be thrilled, because the scent really does last and stays on your clothes well after they are laundered."
5.00,"I have been making my own laundry detergent for a few months now and it is wonderful!  My clothes have never been cleaner, my towels never as fluffy, not to mention how much money it saves.  However,  it has absolutely no scent.  Personally it doesn't bother me, but my husband missed the \"clean \" smell.  These pellets solved the problem nicely.  Just a bit sprinkled in the washer with the detergent added the touch of scent he was missing.  I use WAY less than recommended - We just wanted a hint of fragrance, not to be knocked out by it.  I would say a small palmful for a large load.  The price here on Amazon is comparible to the grocery store but with free Prime shipping it comes right to my door.  The crystals are not fabric softener, but my clothes come out fine without a softener anyway."
1.00,"Let me start off by saying, I really wanted to love this product. I used it first on my sheets, comforter and towels. The smell is heavenly! Unfortunately, I developed such a bad rash almost instantly, that I had to see a doctor. Itchy, red, blotchy, mess. My skin just does NOT like this product. Very sad. Not sure what they put in it that caused me to have such a bad reaction, but if you are the type to be sensitive to perfumes, dyes and fragrance even in the slightest bit, do NOT use this product. I repeat, do not use this product."
4.00,"If you can find a coupon for this product or find it on sale, it's worth buying.  The scent lasts a long time and even infuses dresser drawers and closets with the same pleasant smell.  It also does a good job of removing the \"stale\" scent that occurs from time to time in HE washing machines without resorting to a waste of a hot water cycle using bleach or vinegar.                                                                     That said, the price is the only thing that keeps me from buying it on a regular basis.  It costs a little over three times as much as Purex laundry enhancer crystals.  Granted, Downey's scent is stronger at least initially, but I find the length of time the scent remains and the amount of product used per load are exactly the same. It's no wonder Purex crystals are often sold out but there are lots of bottles of Unstopables still on the shelves.  Downy would probably have more of a hit on their hands if they'd lower their price a bit.                                                                     5 stars for the quality of the product and truth in advertising for performing exactly as the description says, -1 star for price."
5.00,"I wash in cold water to try and save energy but the down side is my clothes don't smell fresh. I can't blame my machine, it's trying to compete with a husband who is a 7 day a week certified gym rat (who looks AMAZING by the way) and 3 loveable but smelly dogs who think our bed is theirs. What washer could compete with all that smelliness? So, I started using Downy unstoppables and now the clothes smell fresh and clean again. I like all the scents but this one is my favorite. It reminds me of flowers however the scent isn't so overpowering that my husband complains his clothes smell like \"perfume\"."
3.00,"Love the scent of this product.  Unfortunately, you do have to add more for a stronger scent, therefore not lasting very long.  To me, not worth it for the price."
5.00,"Love this product and I dont need add a ton to my laundry load."
5.00,"I am addicted to this product. My 8 year old actually commented on how yummy her clothes smell ! I have yet to find a better price even on sale and with free shipping it is a no brainer."
1.00,"The 170 load bottle with the spout is less than $30 at the grocery store! Even if you do subscribe and save you're still spending $40.75 for only 144 loads. Go to ANY grocery store and just buy the giant bottle, it will save you a lot of money! :)"
5.00,"I cannot live without this product. It makes your clothes smell great. I wish they could include the fabric softner in with this."
3.00,"I was very excited about trying this because I like a crystal or non-liquid idea of fabric softener, however it is VERY expensive and you must use a lot to get a fresh smell result. Although Purex crystals aren't wonderful either at least they are reasonably priced. I'll stick with them until someone comes up with something that works and doesn't cost so much."
5.00,"Smells good, which is a personal opinion, of course. You may not love the scent. I use it in the loads where I don't want to use softener, like the dog blankets and towels, etc. The scent lasts, and you can use more or less in a load of laundry depending on your preferences."
5.00,"I consider this product a luxury, because it is expensive if you use it frequently, and let's face it, you don't need it. But I love it on sheets and towels. I would use it more often if it weren't so pricey (or I could use a coupon more than once in a lifetime)."
5.00,"not overppowering just right! easy to use and the pour top is nice.bottle is easy to hadle with smaller in middle of bottle."
5.00,"They smell great and they last and last. Couldn't believe how few it takes for a long lasting smell. We will reorder when we run out."
1.00,"This product made me break out into hives. Can't use it I think my husband brought on sale. Never again"
4.00,"I started out using this on blue jeans, towels, bed linens, and sweatshirts (things that I may use more than once or twice and want to always smell good). Obviously the scent fades over time, but I enjoyed it so much that I decided to use it with all of my laundry. The price point is a little high, so if you're someone who has a lot of of laundry (I don't), then I would recommend saving it for those special loads like I mentioned at the beginning."
5.00,"This blue one is the best! Wonderfully fresh fragrance! Pink one is okay for cute chicks cloths, smells sweet. Don't recommend purple one, smells like a dying grandpa."
5.00,"So if you've seen the TV ads, you probably understand that these 'crystals' are dry.  You put them into the washer when you begin the was cycle - with your detergent.  I was skeptical - I've been the victim of Downey's many 'new scent' campaigns... which were largely a disappointment.  I always came back to the classic product.                                              There is good news with this one!  This is actually more convenient (to use in the wash cycle) than regular Downey (which I had to use only in the rinse cycle)and it does NOT discolor clothes like the 'concentrated' Downey can do to whites.                                              Hooray!  Finally a better product.                                              Yes, even though you put these in the was cycle, clothes come out smelling good and static free.  I absolutely love the tight seal cap that snaps open and closed to keep the small pills in the container in case the tall plastic canister tips over.  I've used it now for several different loads and have had nothing but positive results.  I recommend it."
5.00,"I got this to use with my clothes and I like the results and comets I get.  I will use this again"
5.00,"Smells great and lasts a long time. Is it necessary? Probably not. But it does smell nice and I get compliments sometimes that my clothes/sheets smell really good."
2.00,"I like my laundry to smell nice and the scent lasts as towels and sheets are put back in the closet."
5.00,"I use these in every load of laundry! They have a long lasting scent and are much better than the generic ones. I do think they are a bit expensive but again, they are much better than other, less expensive brands I have tried."
5.00,"These are great to use when washing gym clothes, sheets, and towels. They smell fresh when I put them on the bed like they just came out of the dryer when it has been weeks since they were put in the closet!"
5.00,"I absolutely love how this makes your laundry smell fresh. When I wash my blankets, my kids just want to wrap themselves in them so they can keep smelling it. Love it!"
5.00,"I have tried different scent boosters available from different brands in order to make my laundry smell clean and fresh for days after washing. I had received a free sample of Unstopables in the mail when they first came out, and I loved the scent but forgot the brand so I kept trying different ones. I had tried different crystals (some straight-up made me nauseous), liquid detergents, and fabric softeners to get that wonderful fresh scent of clean laundry, but the Downy Unstopables were the scent I fell in love with. I have put these on the Subscribe-and-Save since I kept purchasing them, and there is no sense in ever running out! I use about 1/3 of the cap full in a large load of laundry, and the scent is absolutely wonderful. I have tried all the different scents and the Fresh Scent is the absolute best to me. The Lush Scent reminds me of my grandmother's house, while the Shimmer reminds me of bubblegum and crazy lip gloss that 14 year-old girls wear. The nice thing about the Fresh Scent is that it's like a spring day mixed with fresh cotton, very warm and home-like. I'm sure this may sound strange, but I even use these in my car as an air freshener. Like many others, I have those socks that never seem to have a mate, so I took one of them and put about a capful of Unstopables in the sock, and then used my wife's sewing machine and closed up the other end. When the prep-work was complete, I threw the sock under my driver's seat and the scent works wonders in my car."
5.00,"The TV ads on this one are true.  The pleasant scent goes on and on.  After a week my sheets still smell wonderful."
5.00,"As long as my clothes don't stink I'm pretty happy, but my wife has become obsessed with the smell of clean laundry. I was able to pick this up as an add-on item with coupons for a ridiculously good price (thank you slickdeals)."
5.00,"This is by far the Best Scent Boosters, the smells lasts until you wash again( just like in the commercial) and it smells GREAT! LOVE LOVE LOVE would never change! if you haven't gotten this you have to get it!"
1.00,"This does not work for me. It has barely any scent. My clothes do not smell any stronger than just with Downy fabric softener. Smells good but is very faint when you open the container but no matter how much I add to the load, barely any scent is there when the load is over. It is as if it just goes down the drain. I even tested this in a cup full of water to see if the water would activate it. I tried both hot and cold water. It took forever for the product to melt even in hot water so I think they are just washing down the drain in the rinse cycle without releasing the scent."
5.00,"I'm in college, and we have over 500 people using the same six wash machines, and well they're high efficiency and they don't get cleaned like they should and therefore no matter how much detergent you use, your laundry still stinks. Instead of trekking 4 hours back home every weekend to do my laundry in a washing machine that does not smell like mold, I just stick the downy in there and bam! my laundry smells great. They're a little on the pricey side, but it's better than going around with clothes that smell like socks. The knock off version by gain does not work as well. the scent for these lasts for weeks, depending on where you keep your clothes. They don't clog your HE washer's filter. they're wonderful."
4.00,"I had a horrible problem with the sulfur smell in the black jeans my daughter got for school this year.  We tried everything: vinegar, borax, fels-naptha, soaking again and again.  The smell would not come out!  I received a sample of Downy Unstopables in the mail and tried it on the black jeans.  They smell great!  All of the sulfur odor is gone (or at least masked).  We're on the second wash since adding the Unstopables and they still smell great.  It's a little too pricey for everyday use, but if you have something that's really stinky, this works well!  Five stars if the price comes down."
5.00,"I wasn't so sure about this at first now I can't get enough of it. I was worried that they wouldn't dissolve they do and the smell is wonderful."
1.00,"They don't last that long, these are much cheaper in the grocery stores. I will not purchase these again. They don't work"
4.00,"I REALLY LIKE THE UNSTOPABLES AS THEY DO LEAVE YOUR LAUNDRY SMELLING GREAT.  DON'T THINK SCENT LASTS AS LONG AS THEY SAY, OR MAYBE I JUST BECOME USED TO IT QUICKLY."
5.00,"Only buy these if you plan on becomming addicted. I seriously smell myself all day after I have been using these, and they should use me as a promo girl because I run around telling people to smell my clothes and then promote the product. I am in love with this. It makes folding laundry an olfactory delight. Also I put some (in a pair of super thin dress socks) in my car (Pinterest tip) and it smells AMAZING. And some in my closet, AMAZING. Towels, sheets, clothes, EVERYTHING. I wish I could sprinkle these around the perimeter of my apartment. My only worry is that there must be a ton of chemicals in these to make them smell so good for so long, so I choose to stay ignorant on that for now but eventually may taper down the use."
5.00,"I just love this new product. I have now tried all of the different sents and this is my very favorite."
5.00,"I love my laundry to smell extremely well. A refreshing scent and not a perfume smell. It's reasonably priced. It gets my recommendation."
5.00,"I'm not one for scented laundry but these Downy Unstopables are great. I sprinkle in just a little and everything smells wonderful. No need to use a lot...so the bottle lasts for a while!"
5.00,"\"Lush\" is my favorite laundry smell ever! After I wash sheets with this added in, I can still smell it after they have been sitting in the closet for months. With my clothes, I get whiffs of this randomly during the day. Like this \"Lush\" scent much better than the \"Fresh Scent.\""
5.00,"When the box first arrived in the mail I of course opened with glee because first off I love Downy and second...did I mention I love Downy.I being the \"follow the rules kind of gal that I am\"... {cough} read through the instructions.*How to Use: Downy UnStopables go directly into the washer drum to infuse a fresh unstoppable scent.Shake a little or a lot into the cap.Toss into the drum of HE or regular washer before you start the wash.Drop in any machine-washable cloths, towels and other fabrics.Enjoy lasting fresh scent.**DO NOT PUT INTO YOUR LIQUID DISPENSER OR DRYER.Use with or without fabric softener.Ok directions read and understood...check!I immediately use in my next two loads of laundry. Jeans and then towels.Upon removing the jeans from the wash they were a bit over powering in scent because my fabric softener is scented as well.My towels smelled SO good. I do not add fabric softener to my bath towels (so they are more absorbent).The best thing happened when I pulled a towel out of the bath cabinet almost 2 week's later. They still smelled fresh and not that stale \"I've been in this cabinet way too long\" kind of scent. A fresh \"I was just brought in from the laundry scent\"! I loved it!I have made the choice to continue using the Downy UnStopables for my towels and sheets. Oh you really have to try this on your bed sheets. I wash mine weekly and they still smell great although dirty at the end of the week.You can find Downy UnStopables in the laundry aisle in your supermarket. With two choices of scents.Fresh - Clean, Airy, CrispLush - Luxurious, Relaxing, Romantic"
5.00,"I was kind of skeptical at first, but I received a sample in the mail and tried it and loved it! Now it's becoming a part of doing our laundry every day, between two kids and a husband I definitely needed this freshness added."
5.00,"I have used Tide for years! Just would not use anything else. I like being able to order it from Amazon in quantities and have it delivered to my house and I get it at a better price!! I like that. I will probably continue to order it from Amazon!!"
3.00,"I am a military member deployed overseas and I brought this to give my undergarments a \"boost\" as advertised. My clothing did get a boost after the inital wash but the boost didn't last very long, maybe a couple days at most."
5.00,"love it makes my clothes smell so fresh no more sheets"
5.00,"LOVE this!! The scent is absolutely my favorite! I got the one in the blue top, I think it's the clean scent. I will definitely buy again!"
2.00,"my clothes didn't smell any different no matter how much i used. a few years back they had a much better product that lasted on clothes for a long time. I'll just stick to detergent."
3.00,"I love that my laundry always smells fresh and clean, however this product is too expensive. I can get more bang for my buck buying the regular Downy FS at Costco."
3.00,"I use a front load washer and I had to remember to put these in first or they would fall out if laundry was already in. I use downy fabric softener and I couldn't really tell a difference of using this or the softener. I will stick to fabric softener."
5.00,"Great long-lasting scent! I use this for my sheets. It doesn't require much for a load to make a difference."
1.00,"Tried using this product with Tide liquid detergent and could not smell any \"boost\" when I pulled my clothes out of the washer and same result after they came out of the dryer. Maybe if I dumped the whole bottle in....??? If I want a scent boost I will just buy Gain powder detergent. The only possible use I could see for this is adding some to home-made detergent....but that's a big maybe."
3.00,"If you already use scented laundry detergent or fabric softener, there is no real value in using Downy's Scent Booster.  The product does work. You pour up to a lid-full of the tiny scent booster granules directly into your wash machine before adding the clothes.  The strong-scented granules dissolve in the water and the scent permeates your clothing. It doesn't smell bad, I am just not sure the advantage of using this product over purchasing a scented laundry detergent or fabric softener, unless you have an issue with really, really stinky clothes."
5.00,"I was really excited to try this product. I read the instructions and realized I would have to experiment with the amount that I used the first time. I washed towels and just covered the bottom of the cup. Perfect. The smell is amazing and my bathroom smells wonderful.                                                                     I used my usual detergent and did not use any kind of fabric softener in the dryer. Didn't need to. Next I washed my sheets using a little bit less. Worked out very well.                                                                     The cost is expensive, but you don't have to use very much. I will purchase when this is gone. Love it."
2.00,"Nice spell and worked good but it did not last as long as advertised. Expensive for the amount of product you get."
4.00,"I could stand for the scent to be a bit stronger, but these make my laundry smell a goo bit fresher, longer."
5.00,"I would use this product sparingly paying close attention to how large your loads are for optimal results. Nice scent!"
5.00,"These are the best! I have found that they work great for towels and sheets, the fragrance stays for a little while. Make sure to put the beads in the water prior to the laundry so the beads can dissolve. I would recommend this product."
5.00,"This product is a scent booster. It doesn't do anything in the way of cleaning or softening, but in the way of fresh scent it dominates.                                                                     I first came to this realization when I opened the towel closet and the fresh scent washed over me like a wave. I took my towel into the bathroom with me and used it after a shower. What an amazing fresh scent. It may be an unnecessary luxury item, and one I probably couldn't afford if not for the Vine Program, but how nice to slip in a shirt and relive the freshness every morning.                                                                     If fresh scent is a priority, this Downy product could do no more to please you."
5.00,"Great addition to a load of laundry to give it a great scent. A little goes a long way. I've had one bottle for over three months. 20 grains or so is all it takes!"
3.00,"I bought this product based on the high reviews and because I really needed to try something of this nature. My husband is a marine and his uniform that he wears every day to work comes home dirty pretty much every single day. About a week ago I washed it on the heavy cycle, with extra rinse, tide detergent, and fabric softener... TWICE, and then used two dryer sheets in the dryer... and it still came out smelling like dirt. We just purchased a brand new washer and dyer so I've been experimenting with a lot of different products to see which work the best. So, I hit the store, determined that I was going to fix this \"unfixable\" situation and make his uniform smell nice. I purchased the tide \"febreze sport\" detergent instead of just the regular tide. And I tried this product- the downy \"unstopables\". I added an entire cap full into the bottom of my washing machine along with my new detergent and my fabric softener. Then threw it into the dryer, again, with two dryer sheets. And.... disappointment. They came out with a very, very faint nice smell. And a couple of HOURS later? Completely gone. This was before he had even put it on. And of course.. when my husband came home from work the same day- smelly clothes. Now, I do have to say this isn't a normal case. Asking to get these smelling nice is like expecting a miracle- and I understand that. I just thought maybe, maybe this would be that miracle. I washed a load of towels next with the same amount of unstopables and they did smell stronger, but actually not by a lot- not a lot more than they normally smell. I did give it a couple of stars because of the way my towels smelled- but to me it isn't worth the money. I'm glad other people are having such success with it- and like I said my demands were a little high."
5.00,"I don't use softener, so this is just what I've been looking for for years! I wrestle human alligators for a living, and my clothes now smell good even after a day of slobber (theirs) and sweat (mine). LOVE it!!"
1.00,"I've been using the normal green one for many months now and have raved about it.                                                                     However, I just switched to lush and got skin rashes in areas where clothing contacted my skin and hives from sleeping in bedding that were washed in it. I did a bit of research and found that I was not the only one getting allergic reactions to this product. (I have no other allergies that I know of)                                                                     Needless to say I threw away the bottle of lush but may switch back to the other scent if I'm feeling daring (or stupid)."
4.00,"This really does keep its scent for months and I use very little in each load. I'm only giving it 4 stars because I'm a little concerned about what it is made of that it smells so long. I'm truly a little scared to use it on anything other than towels and bedspreads. I think anything else and it would really bother my allergies because it is so strong."
5.00,"I like this new laundry fragrance. It's very easy to use, you simply add it at the beginning of your wash and your laundry will come out smelling great. The \"Fresh\" scent is exactly that a very clean and fresh fragrance which I find pleasant. The scent seems to last quite a long time I could still smell it on my clothes after working a full day in them. I only wish this scent booster would double as a laundry softener but for that you will have to buy a different product."
3.00,"The smell is very strong, so I only use this on my sheets and towels, but I don't think this would be something to use with regular clothes."
5.00,"i really love the way these make my laundry smell.my laundry smells fantastic and stays that way for days.even keeps my dirty laundry from smelling bad"
2.00,"I really want to enjoy these scent boosters, but every time I use it, my clothes come out with stains. I have a top load HE washer. I cannot have the washer start, have water in it then add my clothes to it so that option is out. I thought maybe because I used cold water, the beads weren't properly dissolving and were staining my clothes, so I tried it in hot water and nothing changed. I am going to try it one more time by dissolving the beads in water in the microwave and adding it to my laundry before I start my wash. Does anyone have any suggestions on how you have successfully used this product without staining your clothes?"
5.00,"Heres a little tip. Mix a small amount of these in water and place in a spray bottle. You have febreeze at a way cheaper price!"
5.00,"I'll admit - I was skeptical about this product.  I mean I already use Tide w/Downy and Downy fabric softner - why would I need these?  Well - technically I don't since Tide and Downy clean and soften my clothes but even those products don't give me the long lasting fresh smell.  As a pet owner - 1 dog, 3 ferrets and 3 birds - this product is wonderful for me.  Even after playing with my animals for hours, my clothes don't smell like them - I don't have to change my shirt before going out in public.  And true story - one day at the store I work in, I asked a customer if they used Downy because they smelled good.  She said \"No -it's not me - it's you\"  Sure enough I sniffed my sweater sleeve and said \"Mmmmmm - it is me\"  She then asked me what I used and I told her. That compliment is much better than hearing you smell like wet dog or stinky ferrets. LOL"
5.00,"Downy Unstoppables is my new staple when it comes to doing laundry. These things are absolutely amazing!!! They keep my clothes, towels, and sheets smelling so fresh for weeks!! There has been a few times where I forgot to throw the laundry in the dryer and then it gets that musty smell and then you have to re-wash the whole load. I have been using these unstoppable for a couple months now, and the other week I had forgot to switch the laundry into the dryer (oops!) and to my surprise there was no musty smell what so ever! They still smelled so fresh! However, they are pretty expensive and you are supposed to use a capful for each load. In order to save a little money I usually fill the cap only half full. This makes the container last a little longer since I have to put them in every load that I wash now. I love that they keep coming out with new scents as well. My new favorite is the Shimmer!! Smells so delicious!!! Even though these are expensive, they are well worth the extra money! I would definitely recommend everyone to try these at least once."
5.00,"I have to admit that I wondered what I was thinking after I ordered this. I have a fabric softener and even the downy sheets that add plenty of scent. I just knew that this was going to be a disaster - like dumping perfume in the washer. What a surprise. It is a well-blended light scent that smells fresh when you open the washer but not overpowering. Then it goes through the drying and retains this very fresh scent instead of the slightly stale scent normally found in even freshly-washed clothing. Let's face it: most of our water does not smell that great when you hold it up to your nose and fabric softeners seem to just mask with perfume. This booster is definitely different. Two weeks later I can pull my blouse out of the closet and it does not smell like perfume; but it does smell fresh and lightly scented when I hold it up to my nose. A winner"
5.00,"Love this scent. Not a fan of the other scents but this one I love. I use this along with the honey blossom liquid softener and my clothes bed linen, towels smell fresh for weeks. People at work even notice."
5.00,"I do like it. I had never smell my clothes like that before. Thank you very much.                           Regards              Saeed                           &quot;Can you send me a free one :D&quot;"
4.00,"Leave sheets with a nice scent.....this product is not over bearing."
5.00,"I use these in my laundry and throw a few in my my rainbow air freshener so the whole house can smell like laundry day. I know it's just an additive and isn't really necessary, but I just love the smell."
5.00,"I love the smell of these so much will be it getting it regularly everyone comments like nothing I've bought before it amazing"
5.00,"Smells great - I have the FRESH scent. I use less than half a capful because the smell is so potent. I use it on bedding mostly, and my couch cover - not on my regular clothes because I also use body sprays and don't want too many scents going all at once."
5.00,"SMELLS GREAT--AND MAKES THE CLOTHES SMELL REALLY, REALLY GOOD. I WILL CONTINUE TO BUY THIS PRODUCT IN THE FUTURE BECAUSE IT REALLY SEEMS TO GIVE OFF A NICE SMELL TO THE CLOTHES."
5.00,"This is a nice addition to my laundry room. I make my own laundry soap, so this little add in adds a nice fragrant smell to our clothes. Good deal and a coupon to boot! Thanks Amazon :)"
5.00,"Love this product! Only negative is the price. :) Scent does seem to linger on my clothes and towels for quite a long time!"
5.00,"Leaves my laundry fresh smelling!"
5.00,"I love this scent, but it was much cheaper here than in the store. I will continue to buy this, and it's a larger size than in stores."
5.00,"Love this stuff! It makes my laundry smell so fresh! I like the convenience of home delivery! It makes life easier!"
5.00,"The Downy Unstopables are great! Sprinkle in your wash and everything smells good!You can over do it. Less is more here. I also just leave the lid open to freshen the room! Two different scents. Both are great! If you are looking to freshen your world the Unstopables are for you. I Wouldnt buy it from Amazon again. I paid 15 dollars and then they showed up at our local grocery store for 7 with an introductory deal and they ended up being 2 dollars!"
5.00,"I bought this for my husband's pillow case that tends to smell not-so-nice. My daughter used it for her gym clothes and then her boyfriend started using it too. This is good for smelly clothes. We use Method detergent that isn't fragrant, so when we want to overwhelm stinky clothes with a more pleasant scent, this is our go to product. Recommend."
3.00,"I make my own laundry detergent but needed something to make it smell better and these work amazingly. They smell SO good and with a family of four this bottle lasts a good amount of time. They are a little bit more than I wanted to spend but you can almost always find a coupon for these which make it a little better."
1.00,"We use this item to freshen up our wash as our HE machine gives off a non-clean odor. It works for that purpose though the real solution is to get rid of the side load HE machine. You can find this item for 6.99 at local stores."
4.00,"I have been a purchaser of Downy Unstopables since receiving a sample in the mail when they were released. I hoarded that sample, waiting for the perfect time to experiment. I used it on a batch of towels--the amazing scent lasted for DAYS (until they needed to be re-washed that is!). Also, I cannot use fabric softener because of my sensitive skin (I break out from the \"softening\" grease or whatever it is)- so while everyone in the household smelled fresh, I just smelled...well, \"clean\" I guess. However, sometimes we'd get a cheaper detergent on sale, and the smell wouldn't be so pleasant on it's own- forcing me to spray all my clothes with Febreeze or perfume before leaving the house. This has solved EVERYTHING! While they are a tad bit of a luxury item (I will ONLY buy them on sale and usually with a coupon), they do work fantastically! I've purchased both the \"Fresh\" and \"Lush\" and, while I like Fresh better, both have worked well. I use a typical, old-school top-loader and have had no problems with spotting or undissolved beads. I also wash \"warm\" which is really more of a \"lukewarm\" on my washer. The smell of \"Lush\" definitely doesn't stay as much as \"Fresh\" does (I have a thick denim trenchcoat I washed with \"Fresh\" over 2 months ago, and it STILL SMELLS AWESOME! It was to the extent that my mother kept walking past where it was hanging and asking why all my laundry smells so great all of a sudden. I caught her huffing my jacket!) However, I have just washed all my bedding with \"Lush\" and mixed in a little bit of \"Fresh\" and it was an absolute pleasure to crawl into bed last night. When I made my bed this morning, I still smelled the freshness. This is also in a room with 7 small animals (I run a rat rehabilitation and rescue) and seven cats that run around the bed all day. It helps to not only scent the fabric, but the room as well. Sadly, I will only give 4 stars because of the price on here (it IS cheaper in the grocery store). Also, I have not compared this product to others like it, simply because of not wanting to spend the money on something that may not work. It's sort of my \"if it ain't broke, don't fix it\" mentality. Though I hope to get some samples of other brands in the future to compare. And a second note- I have also read the article about \"alternate uses\" for Unstopables. While I love the idea of making fragrance sachets and scenting things in your car--DO NOT PUT THIS IN YOUR CAT'S LITTERBOX!! In reality, cats aren't even supposed to have scented litter, because naturally they need to smell where they've \"been.\" While most cats will tolerate scented litter, to add this much fragrance is simply an irritant and not safe for them. If you wouldn't let your baby stick their face in the bottle and rub it all over themselves without washing, you shouldn't let your cat do that either. Cats clean themselves, and this shouldn't be ingested! That being said- it is a great product for WASHING your pet's bedding to keep it fresh. Just don't go throwing beads all over them and their environment...that's not what the product was made for."
5.00,"I use with every load of laundry.It leaves your clothes smelling great and does an even better job when you you a same scent softener."
4.00,"Everyone in the house knows that the laundry is in the wash as the whole house will be filled with fragrance. There is no need to apply perfume as it smells great out of the wardrobe. Even the wardrobe smells great! Ummmm...."
5.00,"I love this product! I wish it came in bigger bottles, and was a little bit cheaper because I use so much!"
3.00,"I saw the commercial for this product and got excited. I've wanted nothing more from my laundry than a strong fresh scent. I picked this item up for about the same price as an average sized bottle of liquid downey. First off, I have to say that although packaging has never tilted my opinion of a product one way or another, the unstoppables bottle is awesome! I love the colors and I love the shape of the bottle. I ran two loads of laundry using the unstoppables as well as liquid downey, as I was hoping for twice the scent power....In one load, I used a small amount of the beads and though my clean laundry smelled a little better than usual, the scent did not smack me across the face (and I was hoping it would). In another load, I used a lot of the beads and the laundry smelled better but I wasn't overwhelmed. About a week after doing the loads of launrdy, I went back to smell the clean clothes to see whether the scents lasted and sadly I wasn't impressed. Simply put, it appears, at least in my personal case, that I will have to use A LOT of the unstoppables to achieve a strong, long-lasting scent...And if I use A LOT, I will be going through a bottle of the unstoppables every 2 weeks and that is not financially smart for me since doing the launrdy in the past with just downey liquid softener is enough to get a decent smell. I think if you are willing to throw in a ton of the unstoppables in each load of launrdy and can afford to keep buying as it will run out quickly, then it is a great buy. Because I had to use so much of the product to achieve what I was hoping to with less and combined with the not so cheap price, I gave it 3 stars."
5.00,"I simply use this product the way it's instructed. I add it to my laundry and it leaves my clothes smelling good for weeks! It is amazing what a little cap of these can do! Definitely worth it!"
5.00,"this is the best i have come across for Laundry. they need to make different scents. other wise a great project"
5.00,"I use Downy Unstoppables in EVERY load. they make my clothes so fresh smelling long after the wash cycle."
4.00,"It's all about life's little pleasures ... like opening one's linen closet and being welcomed with a fresh scent. That was pretty much what I was seeking in Downy Unstoppables. Here is my report:                                                                     -When I saw the blue hue of the product, I had an instant worry: \"Will the color deposit on my clothes? Especially those washed in a delicate cycle? Or laundered in cold water?\" Answer: There was no color deposited whatsoever. Not on my whites, not on my delicates washed on gentle, and not those wash in cold water. Good news, right?                                                                     -Second worry: \"Will these little tablets completely dissolve or will they leave a mess in my washer?\" Answer: Happily, there was no residue (at all) on the inside of my washer. They dissolved completely.                                                                     -Last worry: \"Will the scent be too feminine for my boyfriend's clothes?\" Answer: No, it is merely a fresh scent. It is more subtle than I imagined, but it is definitely present. The scent can be described as just plain \"clean.\"                                                                     Since the overall scent was slightly more subtle than I expected, I'm not certain I would buy these again (since it may seem that my fabric softener and dryer sheets leave a somewhat similar fragrance). However, I should note that after placing my towels in the linen closet and returning an hour later, I genuinely was greeted with a lovely smell upon opening the door. That may be worth the price after all!"
5.00,"I tried out Downy Unstoppables when I received a sample in the mail, with a load of sheets. I was thoroughly impressed!! Since then so have switched to the Lush scent & have not regretted it. For those concerned about extra cost, I buy the \"try me\" size on sale with a coupon & then use just a small amount only on things I don't wash every single day, such as curtains, comforters, blankets, etc & on linens. I also use in the loads of seasonal clothes that I pack up. So far, so good. Also, my husband is allergic to practically EVERYTHING & I can't use Febreze so I just dissolved a little bit of this with water in a spray bottle & use it as a fabric refresher & it works wonders!!! DEFINITELY worth it!!"
5.00,"I purchased this product after hearing about it since it's release.  I really wanted to have a fragrance booster for use with towels and sheets since I don't use fabric softener on those two types of items.  As for towels, when washed with fabric softener it makes them smell great for sure, BUT you can end up standing there forever just trying to get yourself dried off with them due to the water repelling nature of the softener!  For sheets, I was told by my dermatologist that the use of fabric softener actually leads to breakouts and clogged pores due to the chemicals in fabric softener.                                                                     So, on I went to give the \"Unstopables\" a try.  Wow, is all I can say!  Not only do these make your towels, sheets, and whatever else you choose to use them with smell amazing, but the scent lasts such a long time.  The linen closet in the bathroom has never smelled fresher, and the laundry room as well!  It's also wonderful when you are actually doing the wash, as the scent from the Downy flows throughout the area and is so nice.                                                                     As for the use of these, you simply take off the cap and pour in a little or a lot - this depends on your desires for the level of scent.  That's all there is to it.                                                                     It is important to note that you cannot put these in the detergent or fabric softener tray on front loaders as per the directions - you simply just toss it in the wash with the laundry before you start the load and you are off to fresher, cleaner smelling clothes.                                                                     By the way, you can find these cheaper than Amazon at Wal-Mart and Target, so I suggest checking there before purchasing online!                                                                     2 thumbs up for these in my book!"
4.00,"Love the scent. I thought I was getting a deal but in fact it would have been less expensive had I purchased this item at a local store."
2.00,"Has a very pungent chemical smell which overpowers the floral scent. More expensive that Purex Crystals and doesn't work as well. I did not notice much scent when I removed towels from the dryer, nor after being stored in the linen closet. Tried this product once more and disposed of the bottle. Will not purchase again."
5.00,"I received this product through VocalPoint prior to its release in stores.                                                                     You can add as much or as little of this as you'd like to your wash, and you put it in at the very beginning.  I don't typically use any fabric softener during the wash - just detergent.  My washing machine is older and there's no dispenser for fabric softener, and I don't really like using the Downy ball.  So, this was really nice to be able to just throw in at the beginning and then be able to have the nice, long-lasting smell similar to what fabric softener would give you.                                                                     It's very fresh and clean smelling - something that's appropriate for my clothes and my husband's clothes.  I didn't use it on every single load, but I really liked using it for things like sheets and towels.  They still smell fresh even after being folded and stored away for a little while.  The first day I wore an item of clothing that had been washed with the Downy Unstopables, I could smell it on myself throughout the day, but it wasn't overpowering or offensive - just a nice, clean smell every now and then.                                                                     Depending on how expensive this is in stores, I would definitely consider purchasing it.  I haven't seen it yet, but then again, I haven't been in the laundry section recently either.                                                                     Overall, I would recommend this product."
5.00,"I love this stuff, I wish they sold it in larger bottles. It keeps my laundry fresh for weeks. I tried another brand and it does not compare. I will be going back to this!"
5.00,"This is a great add-on to laundry detergent plus it keeps the front loaded washers smelling fresh longer!! Highly recommended"
5.00,"I use this to help my son in laws work uniform smell a lot better  Very Pleased  I will get this again"
5.00,"I use it in every load of laundry! I put a little in a cup in my car to make it smell fantastic! I even melt it in my tart warmers and my whole house smells fresh! so being a member of Prime and having this stuff on automatic delivery was a must!"
1.00,"These things are horrible and I will never buy them again. They leave oil stains on clothing. The first time I used them I noticed a few shirts were stained when I was hanging them. I thought maybe I didn't notice the stains before I washed them. I just used it on my bedding which was not stained and now it has dark oil stains all over and is ruined. I cannot believe they sell this crap!"
4.00,"I love the Downy scent boosters, makes my laundry smell amazing. However in general they are expensive. I bought this using an AMAZON coupon so got a great price. Also you can use these in tart burners for a cheaper way to make your house smell great!"
5.00,"I got this item for my diy laundry soap I make and I really love the smell of the Shimmer Scent"
4.00,"Works good but should be cheaper in my opinion. If you want your clothes to smell really good you need to use a whole capfull and at that point the bottle wont last very long at all..."
5.00,"The scent of this is truly amazing. I wouldn't have believed it until I ordered it. It is just delightful!"
5.00,"I love this product. I mix it in my homemade laundry detergent to scent it. It dissolves easily and leave my clothes smelling wonderful."
5.00,"First let me say that I agree with those that have said that Unstopables is pretty pricey. I typically save it for my grocery runs where I have a little room to \"splurge\" on a few things. I rarely see them on sale but this week they were $1 off at both Target and here on Amazon so I stocked up!                                                                     I work part-time as a waitress and as you can probably guess, often come home smelling like \"restaurant.\" I wear an older coat that I don't mind getting a little smelly or stained. Last week I washed it with Unstopables and in the 4 shifts I've worked since then, it STILL smells wonderful! In fact, when I walk into the break room that's the first thing that I smell! I've heard coworkers comment on how good it smells in there. I also use it when washing my uniform and I always smell just as good when I leave as when I get there, which really says something. The scent is not over-powering, though. To me it smells as strong as a fabric softener (which I use as well), it just happens to last longer.                                                                     Of course, like other reviewers said, towels and sheets stay smelling nice longer, both when being used and being stored. I use it when washing our comforter and it leaves the whole room smelling wonderful for a couple of weeks afterward. Overall, I'll keep buying as long as they keep selling it!"
4.00,"I had company stay at our house and I washed the guest sheets with detergent and used the free Unstopables sample about a week and a half before company came. (I don't use dryer sheets because it is bad for the dryer thermostat, and I don't use fabric softner because it is bad for the washer.) Our company commented on how wonderful climbing into the bed was each night and how well it smelled. After they left we got busy and I didn't get around to washing the sheets right away, but when I did a month after they were washed the first time, they STILL SMELLED great! I wish it wasn't so expensive, but I now use it for all our sheets and towels. If the price comes down I might use it on all of our wash."
3.00,"This does nothing to help clean your laundry - all it do is add scent to your clothes.  If you really like 'clean' scented clothing then you will probably like this - it's easy to use, all you do is add the little 'pebbles' to your washer before running it, and that's it.  To me clean smelling clothes have NO scent at all, a scent is not needed to indicate clean clothing, it's just an added benefit.                                                                     I liked the scent of this product, but it was just way too strong on our clothing after a full wash and dry cycle, it just lingers in your nostrils and never goes away until you take the clothing off.  If it wasn't so strong I would like it more.                                                                     If you have somebody who is very sensitive to scents/perfumes than this product likely is not for you."
5.00,"Tide is always a good detergent. I never have problems with this brand it gets clothes clean and is not overly heavy with perfumes."
4.00,"I have used both scents & prefer the lavender (purple). Kind of pricey so I only use the product when washing towels that need a \"scent boost\"! I would use more often if not for the cost."
5.00,"Lets face it. Liquid fabric softener is a mess. No matter how careful you are you're bound to get it on the outside of the washer or in places that water doesn't normally touch which leaves stains to clean up later. With pellets it's just dumb and go. No spills to clean up. Unless you spill the bottle on the floor."
2.00,"I tried the sample of this that came in the mail. It was way too stong for my liking. I had used it on a comforter so during the night I had to get up and move it to the closet. The smell still came through. I ended up moving the comforter downstairs. If you need something strong to cover odors, like smoke or pet, then I'd say this is a good choice. If you are looking for something to lightly fragrance your laundry, you should probably pass or use about a 1/3 of the recommended amount."
1.00,"I ordered it after all the reviews about it and also seeing others use it. I did use it as directed at the start of the wash cycle and guess what, the pellets did not dissolve completely and left all the white residue clinging to my socks. This would have been forgotten if they at-least smelled, but nothing. No smell, no scent or \"NOTHING UNSTOPPABLE\" about this. Waste of money. Use it to buy dryer sheets which are way more effective than this.."
4.00,"I've been using a laundry washing product without any scent, and it gets the clothes really clean. I missed the nice fresh scent so I went this route. Perfect solution! Don't expect the scent to last several weeks, tho. The scent may be stronger than a simple rinse with liquid Downey, but it lasts only a few days longer than the liquid alternative."
5.00,"I will not do my laundry unless I have my Downey Unstopables....and what they claim is true about the smell lasting for weeks... And all you have to do is fill the top of the cup to the desired line and throw it in with your dirty clothes and that is it...and when they come out of the dryer, WOW, they smell so wonderful....You must try this product, you will love it... So will your family!!!!"
5.00,"Goodbye dryer sheets and messy fabric liquid fabric softener! We're relatively sensitive around here(my kids were getting excema when I was using dryer sheets and reguar laundry detergent). Now using free and clear detergent but thought I'd give these a try. So far, no bad reactions but I'll update if it become problematic. This is my favorite scent- very fresh and springy without being cloying."
5.00,"Perfect for my husbands work clothes and the other garments that you can't use Fabric softener."
5.00,"I used these in my wax warmer and it made my house smell amazing! They took a little longer to melt than traditional wax melts."
5.00,"I have to say I'm addicted to this product. I use the Fresh Scent in combination with method unscented detergent (I like Method) and downy softener. I put the product directly on the washer, then the clothes, and for towels and sheets I put a bit more after (on top), just because I love the smell so much. I get dizzy with strong smells, and this is just the perfect amount of scent. I am also very allergic, and this product is ok on my skin. The smells does not last for a long long time, but it will hold a couple of days on your sheets and towels. I always get compliments from my guests about the smell on my linen, so I guess it is not just me who likes this product."
3.00,"I've seen this product on the shelf at the store; it made me very curious. Is it a softening booster, or just a scent booster...or what *is* it? I'd take them down and sniff, and wonder what their purpose was.So, when I finally got a bottle of it, I was really anxious to see what this stuff would do. Who wouldn't like having sheets and towels that still smell fresh a long time after laundering?The instructions tell you to add this product (as much or as little as you want) directly to your washer. I have a front-loader so I was a little hesitant to try this, I thought maybe I'd end up with little bits of undissolved product all over, but it did fine. (I did two loads, with different amounts of Unstopables beads in them)While my washer was going, the rooms all around my laundry room smelled fabulous, and ditto while the clothes were drying! I had high hopes for this product and pictured saving it for things like comforters, towels, sheets...But once I took the clothes out of the dryer and hung them up, I didn't notice any extra scent above and beyond what I normally get with a liquid or sheet fabric softener. The bonus to the softeners is added static repellency and softness; the Unstopable is just a fragrancing product. The smell was fabulous, but it just didn't 'stick'.Bottom line on this, I had better results with the GAIN laundry products for lasting scent. GAIN products are just about ALL fragrance and leave a long-lasting scent. The Downy didn't give results anywhere near the GAIN products, and the Downy product costs a lot more. I did put the rest of the crystals into some old socks I had, tied them up, and they are now fragrancing drawers, closets, under the bed, etc."
5.00,"I LOVE this product!! My husband is a Heating Tech. in Alaska and sometimes comes home smelling like the fuel we use to heat our homes! Since starting to use this product, his uniforms come out of the washer smelling great!! I've also been in animal rescue for over 40 years.... No matter what I've used in the past, stinky dog bedding doesn't always come out of the washer smelling very fresh and over time I just throw it away. They do now!! Our everyday garments, towels, sheets, etc... smell great too! This is one product I'll continue to use! Faithfully!!!"
5.00,"I love the way this makes my laundry smell. I use about a cap in a large load, and it smells wonderful! I recently went on vacation and all the laundry packed in my suitcase smelled lovely, even the items that were not washed with Downy. The scent lasts quite awhile too. At least 3 weeks, is what I have kept track of. It's great for washing towels and bedding in before putting in linen closet. Love the way my sheets hold the scent even when put on the bed!"
5.00,"Makes your clothes have a great smell and your linen press. I never put a full capful ... only use a good sprinkle but that would be up to the individual. My children love it as well."
5.00,"I often want my clothes to smell well and so far this is the only softener that does it really well"
5.00,"It really made my laundry feel and smell fresh and wonderful..Just cannot live without smelling the scent on my clothes.."
4.00,"These beads smell so amazing. I don't use it in the wash. Instead I put it in small mesh bags and put them in my dresser drawers, shoe closet, and just around the house. They aren't nauseating/overpowering, yet the fresh scent lasts for weeks and weeks. The only reason its 4 stars and not 5 is because it doesn't actually serve any other purpose but for smell. I wish it actually washed AND smelled great."
2.00,"I'm a HUGE fan of Unstoppables...just not this fragrance. It's incredibly strong & smells like nothing you'd expect from Downy (i.e., fresh, clean, etc.). I guarantee this scent will be pulled sooner than later. For now, stick with the blue & purple containers. They smell AMAZING!!"
5.00,"My mom uses this for my laundry in the wash especially because I tend to sweat and my dirty clothes smell not so great at times. But, she uses only a little bit in a load like almost less than half of the cap and it smells great. I just had to get my own for when I go to college because it leaves my clothes smelling amazing. I get compliments that I smell like laundry sometimes just because of this product mainly. Just to say how long the smell lasts I packed up some of my clothes for college a little over a month ago but I took a shirt to wear from this box just the other day and it smelled the same from when it first came out the dryer my mom said she could smell the laundry smell on me. We pretty much stopped using dryer sheets because of Unstopables because they became useless when my family started to use this product. I love it! Its also a little bit cheaper here than in grocery stores if you want to save a few cents and is delivered on time."
5.00,"This is the best laundry product I have ever found. It smells amazing and lasts forever. People around me are constantly trying to figure out what smells so good. (it's me) :) My favorite use is for my sheets. It lasts forever and I can't wait to crawl into bed after I've washed my sheets with Unstopables."
5.00,"Nice change. I'm a fan of Unstopables and this scent is more subtle and calming for me. Good stuff. :)"
4.00,"I love this stuff. It makes the wash smell so fresh and clean. The scent lasts quite a while, and you don't have to use much so the package lasts through many, many washes."
5.00,"Downy Unstopables.... Oh how I hated you(for the price) when you were released, however after getting samples I cannot go without them. The Blue is definitely the way to go. I do not use the cap, and I eyeball the amount I add."
3.00,"Great scent but my Gain detergent lasts just as long. To me, this is an unnecessary purchase. I suppose it might be good for some really stinky clothes. :-)"
2.00,"I got a sample of Downy Unstopable fresh scent, boy is it strong. It said it was for one load but I have done 2 loads so far, put a few of the pills around my house in different rooms and still have half the sample pack!!! Now back to my review on Purex Crystals...Went to Walmart to buy some Downy Unstopables but found that the Purex Crystals were cheaper so I figured they would be the same so I bought it, WRONG!!!! After I got it home I noticed that the scent was NO WHERE NEAR as strong as the Downy Unstopable but decided to give it a try anyway. I put the full amount that the directions called for in the wash and did the load. When they were dry you could barely smell any scent at all. When I compared it to the clothes I washed with the Downy Unstopable it was laughable!!! The Downy Unstopable wash was done 4 days earlier and still had in my opinion a little to strong of a scent where the Purex Crystal wash that was done and hour ago, barely had a scent at all!!! The Downy Unstopable wash had ONE QUARTER the amount the directions called for and the Purex Crystal wash had the full amount the directions called for. I am TAKING THE PUREX CRYSTALS BACK and getting the Downy Unstopable..I will save money by using one quarter the amount in my wash and I will have plenty of scent in my clothes compared to the Purex Crystals. Do your self a favor, smell the Downy Unstopable and the Purex Chrystals bottle at the store...Downy Unstopable is much stronger and it will be stronger at home. Might be a little more expensive but you will be using a lot less of the Downy Unstopable in your wash. Long run the Downy will be much cheaper. Sorry Purex Crystal but you are getting returned for Downy Unstopable!!!"
5.00,"I never knew about this product and when I saw it I said what the heck why not try it. I am addicted!! I love it and the scent lasts pretty long on the linens depending on how much you put .. I like all the scents so far"
4.00,"No matter what we did or what detergent we used, my husband always felt his clothes did not smell that great after washing. This product has changed all that.... A cup full of the beads before I put the clothes in the washer makes it all come out smelling good. If you like your laundry to have a scent, I definitely recommend this product."
5.00,"I tell everyone at work about this product. It is amazing! I use it especially for bedding, towels and workout gear. The smell it delivers can be overwhelming for some, but I absolutely love it. It almost smells like a perfume and it definitely adds softness to my clothes. I love getting in to bed on freshly washed sheets, because this smell is evident and it's a relaxing smell at bedtime. For obvious reasons I would recommend this product for workout clothes/towels also. I will most definitely buy this product again."
5.00,"I've purchased this product in the Shimmer scent, it comes in a pink container. Not only does this product make my whole house smell amazing while the clothes are washing, but my laundry smells amazing after having been in the drawer for weeks, or if I've used them on bed linens and comforters, they STILL smell incredible! I love having sweet smelling clothes and towels!"
5.00,"i really like the fragrances of several downy softeners, but this stuff is fantastic. i think it makes a difference. my clothes smell wonderful for such a long time. i just add a capful with every load during the wash cycle. i get it automatically delivered every month with my save and subscribe!"
1.00,"I love the smell but the crystals did not dissolve in my brand new high efficiency whirlpool washer. I placed them in the drum per direction (not in the solution drawer) and when the washer was finished the undissolved crystals were stuck in the drain holes of my washer."
4.00,"I love these! They are easy to use... just ad a capful of the beads to your regular wash load at the same time you ad your soap. I've had no problems with them dissolving or leaving residues. They make our laundry smell extra nice and come in a few different scents. These are also nice to use on towels, sheets, comforters, and pet bedding."
5.00,"I have a front loader washer and this is the only fabric softener that actually makes my washer smell good!!! My clothes have a nice, subtle smell that last for weeks and my towels always smell fresh!!!"
5.00,"Nice clean sent, love this!"
5.00,"Excellent product. Makes your clothes smell wonder and the smell lasts for days and days. Only wish it came in a bigger container and lasts longer !"
4.00,"This product is probably not for the average household as it will add quite a bit of expense to laundry costs just for a little bit more scent. We don't usually have a problem with our laundry and between the detergent and the dryer sheets, our laundry ends up smelling fine for quite awhile. It does add a nice scent to the laundry but not that much more than before. You also might end up with objections from the male personnel in your house regarding how their clothes end up smelling, perhaps a bit too fresh for their liking? For me, I like the results but probably won't spend the money or time for every laundry load but save it for my special clothes or for linens we would reserve for guests.                                                                     This is a really nice product that seems to do what it says but may not be useful or cost effective for every laundry load but would definitely be nice to have on hand for special laundry loads. I will definitely buy this product again when I use up this bottle."
1.00,"These are nasty and way too purfumy. My friend uses these and i gag when i hug her. Bad product"
5.00,"We have used this product for years, I buy through amazon because of the subscribe and save savings, along with the amazon mom savings its a steal. Be sure to \"clip coupons\" that are avail on amazon too - you'll save even more :-). In winter you may still need fabric softner to eliminate static cling if you live in a dry climate."
4.00,"I thought I'd try these out to see how well they work. The directions advise one to add a little or a lot - pretty vague - so you have to find your way.  I've found about 1/2 cap works great on towels when using no fabric softener.  I've found on clothes that you have to add a fair amount to overpower fabric softener scent at which point the odor can become a bit cloying.  I believe going forward, I will only use this product for towels and bedding, but that's OK as these flakes/crystals impart a fresh scent without being overpowering for these items.  I will buy again."
5.00,"Downy unstopables are the best. I don't know that I would ever stop using them. They make the laundry smell so wonderful for quite a long time."
5.00,"I am a gym addict and my morning begins with cardio and weights, or hot yoga; but as much fun as my workouts are, trying to keep my clothes fresh is quite another problem - and here is my challenge: After working out I get ready at the gym and go to work, leaving my work out clothes stuffed in the little plastic bag the gym provides, which then stays in my gym bag, in my hot car...for the entire work day! The end result is not pretty!! My beloved gym outfits from Athleta which look pretty and cost a pretty penny...do not smell pretty, even after a good warm wash!! The cooking of sweat in a plastic bag all day is hard for any detergent and machine to boot and these clothes cannot withstand a hot wash! Enter Downy Unstopables....they work!! My go to routine is Tide (ideally with a good strong scent) a warm wash and a liberal scoop of these beads! My work out clothes smell wonderful!! In fact, the smell stays several days so when I retrieve my outfits out of my closet, they still have a pleasant but not overwhelming scent compared to fabric softener which tends to dissapate very quickly! These have become a lifesaver for me and my workout clothes...and Amazon prices are pretty great too!!"
1.00,"I got a free sample of this.  The smell was so bad I had to wrap it in plastic and take it outside.  It was that horrible fake chemical smell.                                                                     Not sure how it works."
5.00,"these smell sooo good.. the bottle says it lasts 12 weeks... I don't agree with that but it does last awhile.. & the price is awesome... esp with add on option"
5.00,"I really like the long-lasting scent this imparts. doesn't do anything for static, but I'm fine with that. I never have much luck with traditional fabric softener for that anyway. the smell lasts for quite a while. Definitely recommend!"
5.00,"I'm a college student living in the dorms and i have to share the washers with hundreds of other people living in my building, so you can imagine how often they get cleaned (my money's on never) and i have neither the time nor patience to clean them myself. so after a while everything that was coming out of my wash had kind of a nasty dirty-washer smell (and i have a very bad sense of smell, so if i could smell it, it has to be bad), and i really don't like going around having my clothes smell like that. I remembered seeing commercials for this and thought i'd give it a try. anything was better than smelling like the dirty washers, so i bought it and gave it a try. since i wasn't sure how much to put in, i put in very very little and am happy to report that even that did the job wonderfully. So if you're living in a building with community washers i highly recommend this product because it does leave your clothes smelling nice."
5.00,"love love love it !!!!!!!!!! This produt is one of my all time favorites. My dog sweaters smell great. My husband love the smell of his work clothes.I use very good laundry detegents and fabric sheets but the smell does not last as long as the Downy Unstopables."
5.00,"This has the freshest, most wonderful smell. There is nothing else like it. I thought I liked the blue Downy Unstoppables, but this Scent Booster is the BEST!"
4.00,"I really love the smell of this product. It reminds me of one of Victoria's Secret scents (I believe it is the Pink color one). I added about half the cap into my laundry and I can smell it faintly on my laundry. I actually poured some of this in a little open container to put in my closet. It helps to disseminate the smell a little. It was a good one-time buy (since it was on sale), but I am not sure about long term."
5.00,"Well, after a short trial, we subscribed for this. It is great and half what the food markets want. Duh."
5.00,"You are definitely going to want to purchase an entire case of this scent. The fragrance is a very light scent but it truly does resemble a melon candy of sorts."
5.00,"I love these little beads. All my laundry smells great. Perfect for the husband's stinky gym clothes. Now when he sweats, his clothes still smell good!"
5.00,"I have had the same bottle for a few months now since you really only need to use a little bit. I try to line dry everything so this works at leaving a nice scent behind. I have tried this one and fresh scent and both are nice."
5.00,"very pleasant scent, which lasts long, even my walk-in closet smells amazing because of this, recommended... one cup is more than enough for a single load"
5.00,"This stuff is awesome...Makes our clothes smell yummy... I have found that I only like this scent though as the other Unstopable scents are a bit too strong for my taste. Love this stuff!"
4.00,"Walmart - Tide pods are back! Tide Pods - $2.24 Use-$1.50/2 Tide Pods, Gain Flings, Downy Unstopables or Gain... http://t.co/6VyS5qf9M4"
3.00,"I received a packet of the blue Downy Unstopables as a free sample in the mail. The package said to use the whole pack in one load so I did. The smell was absolutely amazing! I could smell my clothes through the laundry room wall all the way through my apartment (my apartment shares a wall with my floor's laundry room). The smell lasted for weeks! I loved it.So, the next time I had some extra money, I went to the store. A feeling inside me urged me to stick with the blue ones since the sample was so extraordinary but, as we do sometimes, I ignored that urging voice and threw the purple Lush Scent into my cart instead.The first time I used it I must have used way too little because I barely smelled anything in my clothes. Some of my clothes had NO scent on it.The second time I used it I put the equivalent size as the sample package and while the scent was stronger than the first time I used the Lush Scent, it still did NOT come even close to the strength of the blue ones.The third time I washed, I put even MORE in and still, not as strong as the blue ones but at least I smell something in all of my clothes and bedding.I don't think I'll ever purchase this Lush scented Unstopable again. I'm sticking with the tried and true blue package."
5.00,"Makes our clothes smell great - I'm really impressed! I use a little more than half a cap each time."
3.00,"I bought this because I wanted to use it for my guest room linens thinking I they don't get used often at least they will still have a laundry scent for the next guest (I usually wash immediately after a guest leaves so its fresh and ready for the next). But I tried on towels and I think when the towels are wet it smells a little funny."
4.00,"The Fresh Scent is great for my somewhat musky smelling athletic wear, mostly yoga clothes but sometimes I find it a bit overwhelming for sheets and such so this scent is perfect those things that need less scent boosting."
5.00,"Upon receiving this I was a bit perplexed by the instructions.  Essentially, it says \"shake a little or a lot\" of the Unstopables into the cap.  Then add to your load before you start the cycle.  I was confused by what a little or a lot would mean so of course it took some experimenting to find the balance for me.  I am sure that, depending on they type of machine you have and the size of load you are washing, results will very.  But honestly that is no different then experimenting with any other laundry product.  After about five cycles I have mastered the proper amount and the results are fantastic!  I have a front load washer and found that I only need to use a very small amount (between 15-20 kernels, full load) of Unstopables to achieve a fresh scent, that isn't overpowering and will last for weeks.                                                                     The best way to describe the result is that I can put my towels away in the closet and even after 2 weeks they come out smelling fresh.  It's not so overpowering that every time I walk past the closet it is all I smell.  When opening the closet you do receive a lovely clean waft of fresh air.  If you compare it to the man/woman that wears to much perfume/cologne... this is not the case.  Sure, if you hug me, you'll smell it and say, your clothes smell really clean.  But, if I walk through a room you won't even notice it.                                                                     Ultimately, the simplicity of this product is what makes it great.  It doesn't harm the color of your clothing and is perfect for all colors.  It even works to add fresh scent to white's you have thoroughly bleached. Considering the amount I use per load, this will serve around 80-100 loads.  Well worth the investment to complement the large detergents serving 96 loads."
5.00,"I just love how the add a boost of great scent to my wash! It almost has a slight mint scent which also makes the house smell good while the washer is running. I don't use them every load but I do especially with towels and gym clothes!"
5.00,"I tried these for the first time and much to my surprise it had a really nice smell. It was not overpowering as so many on. I would recommend this product."
5.00,"Love this liquid detergent!!! Leaves your clothes smelling \"just washed and dried\" for several days. It is kind of difficult to keep in the grocery store."
5.00,"I love adding these to my laundry bags, it leaves your clothes smelling super fresh but not overpowering! I recommend it to anyone deployed that has to turn laundry bags in!"
4.00,"I love using this product in my washing machine during the wash cycle. The smell is very nice and lingers on the clothes. I especially like when I take out towels and sheets and I still get a whiff of the aroma."
5.00,"This stuff makes my whole house smell good while doing laundry. My clothes smell great for a really long time, and I get compliments from people about how great I smell. I work in a hospital and it hasn't ever upset anyone with allergies either."
4.00,"The instructions say to put as many as you want in the cap and put them in the wash.  So the first time it was for some towels so I put just over half a capfull - it was WAY too much!  My laundry room was very, very \"scented\" and so were the towels.  In fact, using them after a shower I discovered the scent transferred to me.  I had to re-wash them all.                                                                     Next time, I was using it for a few undergarments and white socks I used very few -- maybe 1/6 of a capfull.  That turned out pretty good and now everything has a nice smell but not overpowering.                                                                     A good product but just a caution to not overuse!"
4.00,"I like this product and for the size, the price was good. I use this in all my dark loads and it leaves a nice scent."
5.00,"I first used this product while staying at a friends house, washed all my clothes before leaving town. Later on when I arrived to my place I noticed the fresh smell Gosh, it was worth it, it's really neat to smell the freshness every time you put your clothes on.                                                                     It's expensive, no doubt about it, at that price point seems more a luxury than something you buy without hesitation."
5.00,"I LOVE THE SMELL of \"Shimmer\", it's fresh & clean & feminine!!! I use the \"Fresh Scent\" for my husbands clothes and he too LOVES the way his clothes smell. Our clothes smell so good and for a week or two after I wash them! I especially LOVE it for our bedding/sheets, towels as well as clothes. Our house smells good on \"Laundry Day\" as it permiates through the air and actually for the first time in my life makes me enjoy doing laundry & I NEVER thought I'd hear myself saying that!! Thanks Downy for FINALLY coming up with something that actually keeps your laundry smelling as fresh & clean as the day you washed them!"
5.00,"I use these in the washer & line dry my sheets and comforters vs. the dryer! They smell so very good, my sister stayed over and wanted to know what on earth I was using."
5.00,"Our homemade washing powder which cleans very well has no fragrance but we take these and throw a few in with the load and the clothes always smell wonderful and one bottle last us several months ( maybe 2 of these a year ) plus 15$ every two years for the washing powder (easy) and you save a ton over the going every month and spending 10$ to have laundry detergent in a bottle that takes a lot of trash can space up (saving here too) because you wont be buying trash can liners as much. For clothes that smell great when we spend 39$ every two years. And 10$ x 24 = 240$ THATS SAVINGS TO ME."
5.00,"I am going to be spoiled with all these great scents. I love the fresh clean smell my laundry is left with."
5.00,"I'm a sucker for that fresh out of the wash smell and this product, as it name implies, boosts that scent. It's particularly great to use on gym clothes, or on our dog blankets. The fresh scent smells the 'cleanest' whereas the other scents smell more perfume-y, but to each their own."
1.00,"We have a nice HE washer but miss the nice smell of the standard washers. Skip this product. No scent added."
5.00,"I received a sample of this in the mail a few weeks ago - the blue scent. I had to decide what I wanted to try it on because the packet only contained enough product for one use. After some thinking, I finally decided to use it on my blanket. My blanket is already blue, so I cannot attest to weather the product stains or not, but I did not notice and discoloration. I used Arm & Hammer (yellow bottle, purple cap) laundry soap, plus the entire sample packet of the blue Downy Unstopables. When I took my blanket from the washer, the smell wasn't very strong and I was extremely disappointed! I threw it in the dryer and waited. I didn't have to wait for long though! As the blanket dried, a wonderful smell wafted up the stairs to meet me. I loved it! The whole house smelled fabulous, and after getting the blanket from the dryer - so did my room. That first night was a little powerful, I may have used a little too much - but it wasn't unbearable. Both of my dogs sleep at the end of my bed, on top of the blanket. The next day, only a little of the smell had worn off, just enough for a nice fresh smell. I also noticed my dogs also smelled wonderful from sleeping on the blanket, and I checked for rashes - they didn't have any. After about a week and a half, I noticed the smell starting to fade. After a full two weeks, the smell was as strong as normal fabric softener and a dryer sheet would produce. About halfway into the third week, the smell was very faint. With this product, before ordering from Amazon I would suggest going to a local store and finding which scent you enjoy most. I personally love the blue scent, but to each her own!"
5.00,"I was skeptical about using the Downy Unstopables because I was hesitant about the scent...What if I didn't like the way my towels smelled?  That would mean that I would have to re-wash an already clean batch of towels and sheets to get rid of what I perceived to be an offensive scent.  Well, that didn't happen as the fresh scent of the Unstopables is definitely a scent that I liked a lot, not flowery or overly sweet.  I do wish, however, that there was more information as to whether the scent would be obliterated when the towels were put into the dryer with dryer sheets which carry their own scent."
4.00,"I just LOVE this scent!  As do most of my family. It helps keep all our laundry (and I have five kids aging 2-16, currently) smelling fresh. An added bonus is climbing into bed each night for an entire week with sheets &amp; blankets that smell like they've just been washed that day.                                                                     &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 this!                                                                     (I don't dare ask what the ingredients all are for fear I'd not want to use it. But with severe asthma in three of us, it's the only fragrant item we've used that doesn't trigger asthma/allergy attacks! So it still gets my 4 stars, 5 if it miraculously had all green/healthy ingredients.)"
4.00,"Does have a nice smell but I can get that with fabric softener. If you want a booster on smell of washed clothing this is for you. nice product..........."
5.00,"These things make your laundry smell amazing. I use them every time I wash anything in the washer. I'm not a fan of the purple ones though but the blue teal ones are great."
5.00,"I used this instead of my usual mouthwash which is also crest and after 2 weeks I can see a difference and my mouth feels fresher after using it. Great product!"
5.00,"I love this brand. Its the only brand I buy for my whole family. It leaves my teeth feeling clean and white. I have always used the brand as a child and so have my kids. I don't forsee myself ever switching!"
5.00,"Yes, this product is pricier than some others. But my Granddad used to say, \" You get what you pay for.\" And that is very true for this product. With continued use it seems to keep your teeth cleaner longer."
4.00,"I really felt like this toothpaste got my teeth clean. It was a little higher in price."
5.00,"I was happy to be able to buy this product at Amazon, all other stores have stopped carrying and it is the best tooth paste to really clean your teeth."
1.00,"I bought this toothpaste at target because it was on sale for $2.17, now I know why. I've only been using it for about 4 days now and have already developed multiple sores inside my mouth because of it, it also seems to make my teeth very sensitive which they normally are not. How this product got past testing phases completely baffles me. This is designed to prevent oral irritation issues yet it does the complete opposite! Crest should be sued for letting this into the market, buyer beware."
5.00,"Love how clean my teeth feel afterwards and has a great flavor!"
4.00,"This product gets used every day in our house. I like how it freshers breath and makes my mouth feel clean. I cannot believe the difference it makes with bad breath. It works from the first use. It does have to be used daily for bad breath. I would recommend this to every one."
4.00,"Using the mouthwash resulted in a fresh feeling that lasted throught the day."
4.00,"I have used the Crest Pro-health rinse for several years now and there are many things that I like about it, and one that I don't. The rinse cleans up your mouth well without the burn that some brands have. The flavor is good too but that brings me to the negative. Do not use this rinse if you are going to eat or drink anything for about an hour. There is a linger taste that really ruins food/beverage taste. Otherwise, a good oral rinse."
5.00,"Leaves my mouth feeling clean. Love crest products!"
4.00,"It was pretty good toothpaste, nothing spectacular, but it got my teeth clean."
4.00,"I don't always like the taste of mouth wash, but this one I like a lot and my teeth don't feel like they have that icky film left on them."
5.00,"Loved how clean this made my teeth feel. My mouth was fresh for a long time."
5.00,"I use it everyday. With my sonicare electric tooth brush. My wife use it too. She use what I buy."
4.00,"The crest toothpaste makes my teeth feel like I just had a cleaning. The taste was so refreshing! I would recommend it to all."
5.00,"it made my mouth feel fresh and clean until the next brushing. it was great. it is already on my list to buy again!"
4.00,"The Crest Pro-health has minty crystals (not sure exactly what the correct term is) and it is very refreshing and clean feeling. I really like the way it makes my mouth feel, and my teeth seem whiter after using it for two weeks. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is the cap....maybe it's just \"user error\" but I don't like the flip cap. Toothpaste seems to ooze out and makes a mess. I like the screw tops on toothpaste. I would recommend using the toothpaste!"
5.00,"I love this new toothpaste. It tastes great and leaves my mouth feeling fresh."
5.00,"Loved this toothpaste. It left my whole mouth feeling clean."
1.00,"I can't believe I'm writing a review of something as trivial as toothpaste but I'm pretty angry right now. Me and my girlfriend just got a Costco membership, and we decided to buy toothpaste in bulk so we wouldn't have to buy single tubes anymore. I just grabbed this pack because it was the one closest to the register and figured which toothpaste I chose wouldn't matter because toothpaste is toothpaste...well apparently not.                                                                     This toothpaste sucks. First of all, it doesn't seem to foam up as well as other toothpastes and it leaves a really crappy feeling in my mouth after brushing. Brushing your teeth usually feels refreshing and other toothpastes I have used leave my mouth feeling minty. My mouth feels like crap after I brush my teeth. My mouth is very dried out and my tongue has a really unpleasant aftertaste. The worst thing is since I brush my teeth before bed, after I wake up my mouth feels even worse and even drier. Guess what the first thing I do when I wake up is?                                                                     On the way to work I noticed that for some reason there was a mucus like substance in my mouth and I had no idea what it was. It looks like I know what it is now.                                                                     It sucks even more now that I'm basically stuck with 4 tubes of this junk. I can't believe that I feel so ripped off buying toothpaste."
5.00,"I will have to get used to mouth rinses...This one is the first I tried and does the job right."
4.00,"Left my teeth feeling clean all day. My mouth was refreshed. Better than the Aquafresh toothpaste I use to use."
4.00,"Great product! I'm quite pleased with the good cleaning results and pleasant taste."
5.00,"Crest Pro-Health Clinical Plaque Control Toothpaste really gets the job done.My teeth feel like a million bucks when I brush with it unlike most other brands of toothpaste.I love this stuff!"
5.00,"mouth felt fresh for longer the most mouth washes."
5.00,"Made my teeth feel super smooth and clean. Loved it"
4.00,"I like this mouthwash because of the plaque control..It has a great taste and doesn't sting my gums."
4.00,"I love the minty flavor of the Crest 3D white Multi-care Whitening Rinse. I drink a lot of coffee and tea and the product claims to protect against stains. So far, so good!"
4.00,"Made my mouth feel fresh and clean. Would buy it again."
5.00,"The toothpaste is wonderful. My kids liked it and we will be using it in the future."
4.00,"I really liked this toothpaste. The flavor was good without being overwhelming. It left my teeth feeling clean and my breath smelling fresh. Thanks for sharing...I will absolutely consider purchasing this product in the future."
5.00,"I have always been a fan of Crest toothpaste. Crest pro-health was another hit with its plaque control...my teeth felt fresher and cleaner than ever."
5.00,"Happy mouth and teeth.. :) will keep using these products"
5.00,"This mouthwash doesn't burn and leaves your mouth feeling fresh...Husband loves and will buy again!"
1.00,"I tried this mouthwash for the first time and I will never use it again! It numbed my taste buds for days after I used it and I couldn't taste anything. It felt like my tongue had been scalded badly with hot soup or coffee. They need to pull this crap from the shelves. What a waste of $5+."
5.00,"I love that just from the dentist feeling, and now I get it every time I brush."
5.00,"Despite being advertised as a toothpaste for people 50 and older, the packaging provides little explanation of what exactly people over 50 need in a toothpaste that those in their 20s and 30s do not need. Comparing the active ingredients to Crest's regular toothpaste, 50+ has 0.454% stannous fluoride (0.16% w/v fluoride ion) vs. 0.243% sodium fluoride in the regular. From doing a little research it appears that stannous fluoride is more effective at preventing cavities, plaque, and gingivitis. Wouldn't everyone want the best possible toothpaste regardless of their age? Either way, Crest Pro-health seems to work well enough. The mint flavor is not overwhelming, and whether or not it is the result of the stannous fluoride, the toothpaste leaves your mouth feeling like you just came from the dentist -- that clean flavor."
4.00,"I liked the way the mouthwash tasted. There was no burning sensation either. I intend to continue using this product."
4.00,"i liked this product. it left my mouth feeling clean. like toothpaste should. its a little pricey."
5.00,"I've been lucky enough to have never had a cavity in my life. Unfortunately for the last several years I've spent a lot of time at the dentist due to issues with my gums receding. My dentist recommended this toothpaste about 6 months ago. I've been using it and I'm happy to report that the last dentist visit I had showed less recession than my previous visits. If you're familiar with gingivitis you know how uncomfortable it can be, this toothpaste definitely helps reverse the symptoms. Highly recommended."
4.00,"Nothing so good as a tall iced coffee on the patio on a warm spring morning! This is my social drink."
5.00,"Cleans teeth so well and leaves your mouth feeling clean!"
5.00,"I really liked this toothpaste. It gave a great feeling of cleanliness and freshness. With most other brands I've used in the past, the fresh feeling goes away very quickly. What I really liked was my mouth felt super fresh long after I brushed. I think at my next dental check up my mouth will be in better overall health!"
1.00,"My teeth have never had issues with discoloring and I get regular 6 month dental checkups. I was given a trial of Crest Pro Health Multi-purpose mouthwash to use after the last checkup. I recently started noticing patches of brownish gray staining on my front teeth and in the corners between the teeth. It's embarrassing and I researched to find out what could have caused this so quickly with no diet changes. Then I read that this product I started using is not only NOT making my smile better, but it is the reason for the staining. I'M NOT HAPPY CREST! Research your products better before releasing them to the public. Now I have to see the dentist again just to see if they can buff the stains off or see if I need some sort of bleaching to correct it."
1.00,"This toothpaste is horrible.  I got it because it was a whitening toothpaste and I fell into the \"pro-health\" marketing hype.  I saw the warning that it may stain teeth and thought that it was the same warning that sometimes comes on at home whitening systems (warning it may temporarily stain the gums white).                                                                     But after using this toothpaste for a few months, two of my front lower teeth turned brown in a very noticeable way.  It took me a bit to realize that it was the toothpaste, but I immediately stopped using it when I did.  The brown stains on the surface of my teeth, and forming in between a few, did not come off when I switched back to my regular toothpaste (or used at home whitening products).  It made me self-conscious to smile or talk.  Until one day I happened to buy a dental pick from the store that also came with a scraper.  I decided to see if the stains could be scrapped off.  Luckily they did come off and I was very relieved (I was considering professional whitening).                                                                     I do NOT recommend this toothpaste at all.  And I think it's a sick irony that Crest would dare put a \"whitening\" toothpaste on the market that turn teeth brown.  And Crest knows it does b/c they even put a warning on the box, though they don't mention your teeth will turn brown, and try to pretend that they've done something to guard against the potential for staining (how about taking this horrible toothpaste off the market?).  And apparently the Crest pro-health mouthwash has an even worse record for turning people's teeth brown (or causing them to loose their sense of taste).  Therefore I will also be pouring out the last of my pro-health mouthwash as well (it burned my mouth like regular mouthwash and caused me to lose my sense of taste or to have a metallic taste to foods).  I'm never buying Crest products again."
5.00,"I love how fresh my breath feels after I use this toothpaste! I will be buying this again!"
5.00,"I love this product. After using it your mouth feels cool and refreshed."
4.00,"I love to have my teeth feel like this after. It really made me notice how they can be abused during the day. Crest is always a household favorite."
5.00,"This new toothpaste fits the brand perfectly! The texture of some whitening toothpastes gets to me, but this was perfect. The flavor was not overwhelming and most importantly, it did the job!"
4.00,"I'll definitely buy this product in the future. My teeth felt great after using it. I am planning on trying the other products very soon."
4.00,"I use it and I have my teenagers using it, too, for extra insurance with braces and afterward."
4.00,"I didn't like the taste so much, but it did work. I don't really like the taste of mint and this was really strong. For mouthwash, though, it was better than average since it worked better than most."
5.00,"This is a good tasting toothpaste that helps to reduce plaque and to help stop it from coming back. Its formula protects against plaque, gingivitis, cavities and tooth sensitivity, while also whitening teeth and freshening breath."
5.00,"I have used this product for over a year now. It does a great job with cleaning and freshness. I recommend this to everyone!"
5.00,"This is a very good mouth rinse. Before I tried this one I was using Crest Pro-Health multi-protectio rinse, which was recommended by my dental hygenist. Their both good mouth rinses."
3.00,"I ordered a product called \"Night Mouthwash\".  The item I received looked very similar, but did not say \"Night\" anywhere on the bottle."
5.00,"I love this mouth wash it makes me feel so clean and fresh."
5.00,"I really loved this toothpaste. A good, fresh taste and long-lasting clean feeling!"
5.00,"Crest comes out with one Excellent product after another and Crest Pro-health For Life is another hit. This particular product is for people over 50. (Hello) As we get older our teeth need extra care and this toothpaste addresses those issues. Gingivitis, tartar and sensitivity are my problems but this toothpaste also addresses cavities, plaque, whitening and fresh breath. Even though I'm getting older, I still care about my smile - how it looks and feels. Taking care of our teeth is even more important as we age because mouth heath affects heart health. This Crest tastes fresh and my teeth feel like I just left the dentist office. The Great thing is, I can have the \"just left the dentist office feeling\" Every day : ) THUMBS UP!"
5.00,"We've been using Crest Pro-Health toothpaste for over a year now. I like the clean feeling I get from using it. My teeth feel really clean, like when I leave the dentist's office. And my dental appointments have been very good since I started using it!"
5.00,"This is a great product. I like the tast of it. It isn't overpowering and has a smooth texture to it. My teeth felt so clean after I used it."
5.00,"I have never used a Crest toothpaste product I didn`t like , and this one was no exception. I will continue to buy this and other Crest tooth paste products"
1.00,"YOU DO NOT WANT TO USE THIS RINSE! It will stain your teeth to kingdom come and take some doing in the dentist's chair to get rid of all the brown spots! Might be helpful for those who have major problems with decay, but otherwise there are better products out there and you should spare yourself the headaches and hassle."
4.00,"great rinse-didn't burn- made mouth and teeth feel clean"
3.00,"This is a decent mouthwash. It contains no alcohol. I happen to prefer a non-alcohol mouthwash. It does contain artificial color (Blue #1). I dislike that. I don't need pretty, artificial colors in foods or health goods, especially in a product marketed for \"people over 50.\"It feels strong in my mouth, but not overpowering. Some mouthwashes feel like they are weak/watered down. I do not notice any medicinal smell during or after use, something I do find in some mouthwash products. It is advertised as \"Smooth Mint.\" While the flavor itself is very mild, the mouthwash does create a very strong astringent effect, as if it instantly dried up all the moisture in my mouth. I didn't particularly care for that feeling.After use, my breath does seem to feel fresh/clean and it lasts for hours.I am not sure what the different is between this \"for people over 50\" product and usual mouthwash. In fact, I compared the ingredients for this product and the \"regular\" Crest Pro-Health. The active ingredient, cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC) at .07% is identical in both products. The Crest web-site says the product has been \"Selected for people over 50 because it is alcohol-free and provides a unique sensation.\"This appears to be simple marketing. I am not saying the product is ineffective, it seems to work. I just find that mouthwash makers seem to love to market their products as \"restoring\" or does this or that, or in this case \"for people 50 and over.\" Yet the products seem to be virtually the same.Over all, this is an OK mouthwash, however I am not sure I can get past the astringent feeling."
4.00,"My teeth felt clean and smooth when I used this toothpaste."
1.00,"I didn't use this product long enough to suffer any of the other consequences mentioned.  I googled simply because I was curious if others felt the way I did about this product.  It appears they do.  Beyond all the other potential problems it has, this toothpaste tastes so bad, I used it once and threw it away."
5.00,"I am really pleased with this toothpaste and I will continue using it for myself and my family."
4.00,"It kept my mouth feeling clean and fresh and helped keep my teeth whiter."
3.00,"Tried during a recent hotel stay and it was average at best. The product dissolve quickly and did not give the refreshing experience after teeth brushing."
5.00,"I love that I am not left with a terrible taste in my mouth after using this mouthwash. It is effective and I feel better knowing that my teeth are clean and protected each night when I go to bed."
5.00,"liked the refreshing flavor! Made my teeth and breath feel clean and fresh!"
4.00,"This product helped my breath feel fresher than the last kind of toothpaste I used."
4.00,"I truthfully did not care for the after taste..other than that, this rinse did a good job and left me smelling fresh..but i just did not care for the after taste. Sorry"
4.00,"I really liked this product! It always made my teeth feel clean and for longer periods throughout the day! Will definately be buying this product!"
4.00,"Wow, hysteria on Amazon! I'm used to the opposite! Many products on Amazon receive what I consider to be fraudulent reviews in favor of poor products but now I see it goes both ways!                                              Regarding this product: Anything that kills the crud growing on your teeth will leave the dead crud as a brownish film on your teeth. I have used other products that do the same thing. One is grape seed extract or GSE. When I first started rinsing with that it left my teeth brown! I did panic a bit but then found I could simply scrape the brown off. It's like a rock in a river with moss on it. The moss weakens the rock because of the roots but take the rock out of the water and in to the sun and the moss dies and turns dark but then can be easily scraped off leaving a more healthy rock or in this case a healthy tooth.                                              Another such product is MMS or sodium chlorite. When used properly to gargle in the mouth it kills everything.                                              I've used Crest Pro Health for a few days now with no problems and I feel like a few people panicked and are now blasting Amazon with negative reviews on this product. Crest Pro health is a good product!"
4.00,"I liked the way my teeth looked and felt after using this toothpaste! I feel like my teeth were whiter and I liked the taste."
4.00,"I have used Colgate for years, but decided to try this as I also got a new Oral B electric toothbrush. I love both! I have had trouble with excess foaming when using an electric toothbrush, but this was great. My mouth feels clean after brushing."
3.00,"The toothpaste tastes like Crest Complete but I didn't like the medicinal aftertaste. I think this is better for those with plaque issues. For now, I will stick with Crest 3D White."
4.00,"Loved how long the clean feeling lasted, although after about half an hour the 'after taste' from the mouth wash started to get a little funky."
5.00,"I loved the crest clinical strength mouthwash.Doen't burn your mouth plus keep it fresh for longer!!!"
5.00,"Great minty taste and my teeth felt very clean. Thumbs up!"
4.00,"Doesn't burn. My wife and I use daily and have no teeth browning. Don't know what others are complaining about!"
5.00,"Oh, I love this rinse, makes my mouth feel so fresh and germ free!"
4.00,"both my husband and I tried the crest prohealth with plaque control and it had a great taste and works wonderfully. we both will be using in the future"
2.00,"I was almost afraid to open the tube of Crest Pro-Health Clean Mint Toothpaste after reading the reviews here. I did though, and fortunately haven't experienced any of the side effects mentioned here. With that being said though, I really do not like this tootpaste. The first thing I do not like is the taste. The only way I can describe it is that it tastes \"unpleasant\", and the taste lingers. The toothpaste is also abrasive and like brushing with sand. I will not be using Crest Pro-Health Clean Mint Toothpaste again."
5.00,"Great. Improved my oral health from one visit to the next. Gets better as your health gets better. Try it."
5.00,"Love the taste, and the way my mouth feels afterwards -fresh and clean for a long time."
5.00,"loved it the rinse !!! my mouth feel so fresh and clean without that alcool feeling"
5.00,"We loved this product, it got our teeth and mouth feeling really clean and fresh, we use it all the time now."
4.00,"It goes on smooth. It's firm not sliding all over the toothbrush. It tastes good and leaves my mouth feeling clean without that medicine taste. All in all I don't what else to say except that I would buy this product and my dentist would be happy."
4.00,"Crest Pro-Health For Life Smooth Mint toothpaste is a product cleans my teeth while reducing the sensitivity I experience. I can't say whether it has made my teeth whiter or not but I feel like the toothpaste is doing its job and keeping my teeth clean. The flavor isn't my favorite but I'll get over it."
5.00,"I loved this product! It makes me feel clean every time I use it!"
5.00,"Made my teeth feel really clean, almost dentist-clean!"
5.00,"Really cleans and makes my teeth feel smooth and my mouth feel fresh"
5.00,"these were a good price, so i got them. this is the only kind of toothpaste we use now. We find it works great."
5.00,"This rinse works great, leaves your mouth feeling very clean..we love all the ProHealth products and this is a great addition!"
4.00,"This product made my teeth feel clean and my breath fresh."
5.00,"hae been using this for about a week now. it seems that our teeth are getting a little whiter. like all toothpaste it isn't going to happen overnite. i think with this product if one continues usage over time you teeth will become whiter and whiter"
4.00,"I really don't know why Crest needs to come up with a toothpaste directed at the 50+ crowd. I'm 60 and I had the same dental conditions I had when I was 40. The toothpaste has little to distinguish it from other Crest products, which I do like. I would prefer peppermint to spearmint, but it is not appreciably different from any of their multi-complete-whitening toothpastes. I would buy it and use it again, but would not pay a premium for it. I suspect the marketing of a new Crest toothpaste is more about filling shelf space and crowding out competitors than about offering a formula that does anything different."
5.00,"I loved this mouthrinse! It has nice fresh smell and taste, it's very gentle - doesn't burn your mouth when you rinse. It's antigingivitis/antiplaque - very important when you care about your dental hygiene and health."
5.00,"I absolutely loved the way my mouth felt after using this product. Fresh breath and my teeth felt like I had just left the dentist!"
5.00,"I gave a bottle to my Mom and she loves it! I like how fresh it leaves my mouth. Clean and fresh and alcohol free!"
5.00,"I loved the way my teeth felt and the fresh breath lasted. I higly recommend this product."
4.00,"The product tastes much better than I thought it might ... and it does so many good things for your teeth, gums, and mouth!"
4.00,"I really liked the new Crest Pro-Health Clinical toothpaste. It left my teeth feeling squeeky clean and fresh. Fresh feeling lasted throughout most of the day."
5.00,"I love the entire product line, they have helped with gums. I have my entire family using these now."
5.00,"I loved the fresh feeling in my mouth after using this toothpaste."
5.00,"My dentist recommended the wash. I use an oz every night before bed. It has a wonderful taste & it really works."
4.00,"I have always been a loyal Crest user, so I am always excited to try new products by them. I did enjoy the toothpaste, but it did not leave me with the overall \"Wow!\" clean feeling that I get from another Crest product line. If I had coupons and found this at a great deal, I may purchase it, but it would not regularly replace my current toothpaste."
1.00,"Wish I'd read about this before I bought it. I wanted a flouride rinse with no alcohol. For the first few days I noticed a weird aftertaste, but today is the worst so far. It's been over 12 hours since I used the rinse this morning and my tongue still has a metallic taste and burns a little bit. Can't find my receipt but I still might take it back to the store tomorrow and suggest they pull it from their shelves. Absolute crap. Glad it hasn't stained my teeth yet, as I've seen is the case for other users. How is this still on the market when complaints started rolling in in 2008???"
5.00,"Ive been using this since it came out and its my favorate toothpaste. a;ways keeps my teeth and mouth fresh and clean"
1.00,"Here I thought I was doing something so wonderful for my mouth and teeth and now I have brown stains in between teeth! Beware!"
5.00,"We love the Crest Pro Health tooth paste! I wouldnt let my family use anything diff!"
5.00,"This isn't a whitening tooth paste but it sure feels and looks great! I can't believe how much it works. All I can say is IT WORKS!"
5.00,"Sorry to see it going away. We've been using it for ages! Hope something else comes about when we've used up this recent purchase."
5.00,"What a blast of flavor. My breath smells great,fresh and clean, after using this for several hours. I wouldn't advise using it just before eating though or it's all you'll taste. Works fast and love the measuring cup cap. I've used it for just a week and have an area inside the bottom two front teeth that really seem to get plaque build up very quickly and this appears to be getting rid of some of that so I figure over time it will most likely get rid of that problem. That will be nice because the plaque in your teeth can give you bad breath and I'm in direct sales so that's a very bad thing. I did find it for less at WalMart though."
5.00,"I would certainly recommend this product to others. I'll be purchasing it again."
5.00,"liked this product as much as I do all Crest products."
4.00,"I love the crisp, clean taste and how it made my teeth feel really smooth and clean. Will definitely buy again."
5.00,"I loved this toothpaste. It did what it claims and left your mouth feeling fresh and clean and as perfect as when you leave the dentist's office. This is my new toothpaste of choice! It should be yours too! :)"
5.00,"I loved the Crest plaque rinse and the toothbrush as well. I have sensitive teeth and sometimes even rinses will bother my mouth, but this one didn't. It was a very pleasant taste and did not overwhelm my mouth with a strong odor or after- taste. It left my mouth feeling refreshed and clean and it lasted for hours. I would defenitely recommend this product to my friends and family."
5.00,"I like the way my mouth felt after using it. I was extremely impressed when my son used it. He had grinding dust enbedded into his teeth (little black specks) he used it last night and the specks dissappeared. I will keep using it."
5.00,"I absolutely loved this product. My mouth felt clean and fresh all day. I seen a difference in the color of my enamel and my gums brightened. The product works however, this would be a luxury item in my household."
4.00,"We are trying to instill good habits for the mouth with our son. Our son loves how his mouth feels after a visit to the dentist. Since we have started using the family of Crest products, he has stated that he loves how his mouth feels. Yea!"
5.00,"I guess the only thing I can attribute this to is crest products, their value and quality is excellent and these are no different!"
5.00,"I love all the Crest premium toothpastes, and this one is no exception. It leaves my mouth fresh and clean, with a great minty taste."
5.00,"oh what a feeling! wowza! My teeth feel like we've just come from the dental office - so smooth, such confidence in my smile. A pleasure to brush longer."
1.00,"I've been searching for a no burn mouthwash for adults, because basically every adult mouthwash either has a strong mint flavor (not my preference)or has alcohol. I also wanted to choose one that does more then kill germs, and this seemed like the perfect solution. Clean mint isn't overpowering as far as mint flavors go, but IT STILL BURNS! What is the point of putting \"no alcohol\" on the bottle? That only implies one thing, that it won't burn. This does, in fact, burn. Luckily I haven't experienced the brown spotting that others note, but that's probably because I can't stand a full 30 seconds with this stuff in my mouth. I wouldn't say I have a sensitive mouth or teeth either. If you're like me and seek a mouthwash that doesn't burn, just pass up the entire Crest Pro Health line. I guess it's back to ACT kids bubble gum flavor!"
5.00,"It does the job of whitening teeth quiet well without tasting like medicine."
4.00,"This rinse has good flavor. It makes my mouth feel clean!"
5.00,"Crest Pro-Health Whitening Fresh Clean Mint Toothpaste 7.8 Oz (Pack of 4).              Can you tell me what is the date of exp? Thank you!"
5.00,"Love this toothpaste. It made my mouth feel so clean and fresh. The only problem with it is that it made the inside of my mouth peel."
5.00,"As someone who struggles with bad breath, this product is a great help in keeping my mouth fresh feeling!"
4.00,"I really am satisfied with this product. It makes my mouth feel fresh and clean for hours."
5.00,"I really liked this toothpaste. I have problems with ssensitive teeth and have liked this toothpaste the best for my teeth. The texture of it is great and really makes me feel clean!"
5.00,"The toothpaste was pleasantly surprising. It was not too \"harsh\" feeling and the clean feeling really did last for a while after brushing."
4.00,"I really liked this product as it had a fresh and pleasant taste, unlike some of the other toothpastes. The taste and freshness lasted even after eating food."
5.00,"Enjoyed crest prohealth toothpaste,clean,fresh taste and mouth feels grrreat after use"
4.00,"If to mouth rinse with Crest before the bed, then there is no bad feeling in the mouth in the morning. I like it."
5.00,"Works great, will start to burn if you are not used to mouthwash at first. Teeth feel better and whiter almost instantly!"
5.00,"Crest is a great company and yet again proves that they offer high quality products! This mouth wash was unlike others in that it did not leave a terrible after taste and left my teeth feeling absolutely clean!"
2.00,"I was impressed with the mouth wash! My mouth felt so clean after."
1.00,"I bought this product not on Amazon but should have read the reviews first. I only used it for 2 days and almost didn't wake up on 1-20-14. I am very lucky that I did. I was gagging, my tongue was swelling and my throat was swollen out past my chin! I took a Benadryl and went to the ER. I am on Benadryl, Prednisone and have to carry an Epipen all from this mouthwash! I have seen my Allergist Doctor and tomorrow I see a Ear, Nose, Throat Doctor as I am still having issues. I have been a Crest user since I was a kid and this is the first time I tried the mouthwash and it TRIED TO KILL ME! Don't use this product. I have seen over 500 consumer complaints on the internet about this very thing since then. It is not just me that this is happening to. My bills are skyrocketing from this product. Update as of Jan 23rd. Saw a ENT Doctor today and I still have residual allergic reaction swelling. More predinsone and benedryl with a recheck next week. I haven't used this mouthwash since Sunday night and it's still causing issues! My doctor and I are reporting it to the FDA. If you have a reaction to this product please also report it to the FDA to get it off the shelves! Update as of Feb 10th. Still have jaw and tongue swelling and more medical bills. I just reported it to the Better Business Buerau. ***This product won't get off the shelves unless your report it to the FDA and the BBB online. It is very easy to do both. Just doing a review like this won't get it off the market. Please do the reports****"
4.00,"I loved the feel of the toothpaste, the taste wasn't bad either! My teeth felt clean and I didnt feel I had to brush them again after I had my coffee, like I do with other toothpaste!"
5.00,"Love it, works great your teeth feel like you been to dentist."
5.00,"My son loves to brush his teeth with his Jake toothbrush and toothpaste, he calls it \"his paste\", which makes us both very happy."
4.00,"Love the Crest products! I am not usually fond of mouthwash, but I like the that this one fights plaque and gingivitis both!"
4.00,"It left my mouth feeling clean and fresh even hours after I brushed! I really liked that."
5.00,"My teeth felt super clean after using this product. By the time I got half way through the tube I had noticed a big difference in how my teeth felt. I have to be careful though...something in the toothpaste makes my teeth a little sensitive so I'm alternating between Crest and a toothpaste designed for sensitive teeth."
4.00,"My breath smelled great for hours and my mouth felt clean for a long time after using."
5.00,"Very good product"
5.00,"Great toothpaste from a brand I trust. Would definitely purchase again!"
4.00,"My family and I are very excited about this new product from Crest.We have tried other sensitive toothpastes and most are just fine for the price and value. What is so different about Crest Pro-Health toothpaste is it works it really really works! It takes care of those sensitive spots that so many of us have, it's gentle and it leaves your teeth feeling like you just left the dentist's office. If you want to try one new product this year treat your teeth and your smile to this new product."
1.00,"I initially bought Crest Pro-Health for my husband in December 2007. A few weeks after, he began to experience a rash and itching on his legs and arms. We didn't link it to the change in toothpaste, not realizing that a product as common as toothpaste could cause a rash elsewhere on your body. Therefore, he had continued to use this toothpaste, with the rash persisting, until recently. In July of 2008, I bought the same toothpaste for my teenage daughter. A few weeks after, she also began to experience a rash and itching on her legs and arms. After consulting the doctor and reviewing any recent changes that may be causing this rash, Crest Pro-Health was the only change that occurred. A couple of days after discontinuing use of this toothpaste, the intensity of their rashes has lessened greatly. Apparently they are allergic to the stannous fluoride (versus sodium fluoride which is found in regular Crest). This is not a common allergy, but nonetheless, should be considered if someone is experiencing a rash. I will not be buying this product again, nor will I buy any other products with stannous flouride."
5.00,"Love this product. My mouth feels really clean afterwards!!"
4.00,"I love this toothpaster, Its awesome, and great especially if you have sensitive teeth, they have a line geared to that!"
5.00,"This is the most innovative mouthwash I haev ever tried! I love that it foams up in my mouth, making me feel as if my teeth are getting extremely clean. My mouth tastes really fresh afterward, and remains that way for a long time. I will definitely buy this product again!"
3.00,"Crest Pro-Health Smooth Mint Mouth Rinse falls into the category of refreshing, alcohol-free mouth washes. It has a pleasant minty flavor.The active ingredient is 0.07% cetylpyridinium chloride, a quaternary ammonium cation antiseptic. Research has shown that it has a small beneficial effect in treating gingivitis and preventing plaque and it is generally regarded as safe when used for short periods of time. However, I do not think that using antibiotic agents on or in the body on a regular basis in the absence of an infection is a good practice because it interferes with normal, helpful bacteria and can cause health problems. Oral microbiology in particular is complex and disturbing the natural balance of microorganisms could cause harmful species to proliferate.I also prefer a stronger, more astringent mouthwash with fluoride.So while I would recommend this mouthwash for people with gingivitis, I wouldn't recommend it for everyday use for people with healthy teeth and gums."
4.00,"This toothpaste made my teeth feel very clean and my mouth feel very fresh. I will buy it again. My 14 yr. old loved it!"
1.00,"I tried the Crest Pro health and within a day I started feeling the tip of my tongue swelling and getting sore. I could see the taste buds all red and raised. Its been a week now and I realized that it is because of this toothpaste. I can hardly eat anything as my tongue is so sore. I have stopped using it and hope to get better in a few days. Will never buy Crest products again."
5.00,"very nice product! Teeth felt so amazing...would definately buy & recommend this toothpaste! ;)"
5.00,"Hey, just wanted to let you all know that I have been using crest pro health mouthwash now for years. I needed a mouthwash to help with mild gingivitis and I can't stand Listerine. Since I started using it I haven't had any gingivitis and my teeth have been in excellent shape. The idea that this mouthwash could \"leave\" stains is ludicrous. I feel like this product has been falsely targeted for negative reviews. I wouldn't advise ordering something like this online, but I pick up a new bottle at target every couple months. My only complaint is that lately I haven't been able to find the clear kind, but the blue kind is just about as good. As a side note, I looked into their FDA submission and they had to do extensive testing on this due to how it is marketed. I would trust any bottle with the seal in tact that you purchased from a reputable store. Sounds like you all have been getting repackaged turpentine from Asia... : ("
5.00,"Only toothpaste I will use from now on. It makes my teeth feel really clean and helps with sensitivity and other issues like sensitive gums all in one toothpaste. Highly recommended."
4.00,"This toothpaste left my teeth feeling clean. It did a great job removing the plaque."
5.00,"I personally use biotene as I have very dry mouth, but my grandson prefers the pro health than the regular ones. My grandson did not like brushing his teeth,but since I gave him the pro health, he likes brushing as he says he likes the taste and his mouth feels good."
5.00,"I love this toothpaste. It's awesome. My teeth not only feel really clean but they feel smooth as well. I will definitely buy this in the future."
5.00,"I loved it, my teeth and mouth felt fresh and cleen and feeling lasted. teeth look brighter in just days!"
4.00,"This product is a nice cross between scope and listerine. It provides a clean and fresh rinse but does not burn in the process. I think this is a product I would purchase in the future."
4.00,"Smooth clean teeth, and long lasting fresh breath. Great product."
5.00,"Was a great tasting toothpaste that made my mouth feel refreshed and clean."
3.00,"When I bought this toothpaste, I had high expectations from the claims it had on the box. After I used it a few times, I realized that this was just another toothpaste. I did not notice anything different with the way my teeth felt. I did like the flavor though!"
1.00,"Tried Crest Pro Health Toothpaste. Seems OK as you're brushing but when you're done, it tastes like you just ate bad cheese. No fresh feeling like a good mint toothpaste. I ended up throwing what tubes we had in the trash and going out to buy regular Crest with Scope -- much better! This stuff is awful -- don't waste your money!"
5.00,"It feels like I just left the dentist every morning!"
3.00,"It was okay but I felt that it was expensive compared to similar products."
5.00,"This toothpaste makes your teeth feel extremely clean and also my gums felt nice after using this product. The clean feeling also seemed to last longer than usual toothpaste products."
1.00,"Crest pro health complete mouthwash claims to be \"6 benefits in 1\". Well, one of those \"benefits\" is the no burn of alcohol. This isn't really a benefit, because it isn't something adding to your dental care. So it's more like 5 benefits in 1. It also stains your teeth. Why risk teeth staining just to maintain a healthy mouth? Listerine Total Care is very similar, and it atleast has 6 benefits in 1, and won't stain teeth."
5.00,"I started using the Crest Clinical Plaque control toothpaste two weeks prior to my cleaning. I always got the \"You need to pay attention to your gums & floss more\" speech. But, as a mom of three boys, I'm lucky if I flosss 4 nights a week! But, after using Crest - I got a \"Your gumline looks great!\" I highly recommend this! Great product & the flavoring is better than most!"
1.00,"I guess it was my fault for odering these without checking the whole ad. I took it for granted that they were 7.8 oz. like the ones I had received in the past. Anyway, my son pointed out to me that these were basically the size that he receives as samples from his dentist so I went ahead and cancelled the order. Funny thing, within minutes of cancellation, the order was shipped already. I did not accept it when it arrived in the mail but wrote to Amazon and they gave me full refund, including postage. This complaint is not against the toothpaste but the seller who actually has the nerve to charge this price for mere samples. The toothpaste is excellent and we've been using it in the past, as recommended by our dentist. Luckily, I found the size I wanted on Amazon a little later and ordered it, of course - at a very reasonable price. Moral - read the advertising and pay attention to every detail. Amazon, I believe, has no control over the prices that the sellers set. So it's up to us, the buyers, to decide if we're getting ripped off or a fair deal. But as always, Amazon is willing to make good (even where our mistakes are concerned). It's one of the reasons why it's still my favorite \"Market Place\"."
5.00,"Was very happy with the toothpaste. Felt my teeth were very clean after using it."
4.00,"I enjoyed how it made my teeth feel.. but it was a little more then I like to spend on toothpaste."
5.00,"Works great, good tasting, cleans well, whitens teeth and freshens breath. Good size and value, will last you months and months."
5.00,"I love just about all the toothpastes in the Crest lineup, and the Crest Pro-Health Clinical Plaque Control is no exception. It has a pleasant, non-antiseptic taste, and leaves my mouth and teeth feeling refreshed and clean. After using for about a month, I do not notice any change in the sensitivity of my teeth, however, my teeth are very sensitive, so I suspect it'll take something stronger to help in that area. That being said, I still rate this five stars because it does a great job at making my mouth and teeth feel very clean."
5.00,"This new Crest toothpaste left my mouth feeling clean and fresh!"
5.00,"I really liked this toothpaste. My mouth feels good and clean."
5.00,"This is really good toothpaste! I would recommend it to anyone! After brushing my teeth with this toothpaste, I felt like I just came from getting a cleaning from the dentist office!!"
3.00,"This mouth wash was good. I didnt like the taste tho and its A little pricey."
1.00,"On the plus side, no alcohol, so it's easier to rinse for the recommended period of time. But when I looked in the mirror this morning, I noticed my teeth were a light shade of brown along the gumline. Had recently started using Crest mouthwash, so on a whim I googled it, and low and behold I was not imagining it. My fiance had also complained that his sense of taste was off after using it, but I thought he was imagining it. Guess I owe him an apology."
5.00,"I love this toothpaste and it's accompanying mouth wash product. I have never experienced anything remotely like some of the other reviewers (red stains or film inside mouth). I saw an immediate improvement in my gums after using this toothpaste. The mouth wash keeps your mouth feeling fresh for hours, which is something many others have only claimed, but I never experienced. I highly recommend this toothpaste and I don't foresee myself ever switching brands again."
1.00,"I've been using ACT for several years and thought I'd give this stuff a try. Boy, do I wish I'd read the reviews on this page first. I used it this morning and I've had a bitter taste in my mouth all day. Worse, anything I eat or drink has that same bitter taste. My tongue feels like it's been burned, like cheese burn from a really hot pizza.Avoid this stuff. It's horrible."
1.00,"I should have checked reviews on Amazon before buying this at the store. It BURNED my tongue! I couldn't taste food all day because of it! WORST mouthwash I have ever experienced. There should be a RECALL for safety hazard."
4.00,"It was a good mouthwash, a little expensive but it left your mouth feeling clean"
5.00,"This is a wonderful product. I enjoyed using it so much I had my kids try it out. They liked it too. I will be switching brands."
5.00,"I liked the clean feel I had after brushing and it lasted throughout the night without me waking up to a fuzzy mouth. I also like that the taste wasn't so overpowering and didn't burn the way some toothpastes do. Even my oldest son tried it and said he liked it which is unusual."
4.00,"This didn't work any better than other toothpastes I've used in the past. Did have a nice flavor, and left my mouth feeling fresh."
1.00,"Finished a bottle of this before starting to worry that there was something horribly wrong with me or my dental hygiene habits due to the staining on my teeth that was so bad multiple people noticed and told me to see a dentist right away. It took my a while to figure out that this was causing it, because mouthwash is probably the last thing you would expect to stain your teeth. The fact that these people sell oral hygiene products that STAIN YOUR TEETH is absolutely absurd and reprehensible.                                                                     Never buy this product unless you want your teeth to look like they're rotting. This is literally the worst product I've ever used in my life. It does exactly what it's designed not to do. I'm definitely never buying Crest products again and will probably try to avoid P&amp;G all together just on the principle."
5.00,"I loved the way it made my mouth feel, and my teeth were so clean. Love the product."
4.00,"The toothpaste was fine. It wasn't my favorite, the flavor was a little week and the residue that was left on my teeth was a little bit annoying. I'd buy it again if the price was right."
4.00,"It left my mouth feeling clean and my teeth shiny white!"
5.00,"So I had a problem with Tartar and Plaque. I don't love flossing, although it can be satisfying. I picked this up instead of the Aquafresh crap I was using before. Dentist used to rag on me about weak gums and plaque build up. Last checkup, no complaints. Takes care of my gums, destroys plaque. Awesome."
1.00,"I have to say the 1 star reviews for this product are accurate; a family member of mine experienced all the terrible things mentioned in other reviews. According to our doctor, this product caused her to loose all the good bacteria in her mouth and encouraged yeast/thrush. Now she's completely lost her sense of taste and there're white/dry spots all over in her mouth. Please beware, don't ever use this thing. The toothpaste contains the same active ingredient (CPC); stay away from that one, too."
5.00,"After so many bad reviews, I asked my dentist about this before using.  He told me that there are problems for some people, if those people are not cleaning their teeth properly and have a plaque or bacteria issue.  This toothpaste, more or less, agitates this, which may make your mouth appear worse before better.  If that happens, a simple dental cleaning will solve things for you.                                                                     With that said, most people won't have any issues.  I certainly didn't.  This product worked great for me."
5.00,"For a cleaner mouth this product is great!"
5.00,"I have sensitive gums and teeth and like this product because there is no burning or strong taste from it. You can use it up to 2x's a day and it provides multi-protection from germs, plaque and bad breath. I use it with toothpaste for sensitive gums and teeth. The active ingredient is Cetylpyridinium chloride, .07%. Probably only chemists know what that is? But I do know that it is soothing on my gums and doesn't burn my tongue or cause any tooth pain when I use it like alcohol based mouthwashes do. My only complaint is that it has a bit of too sweet taste from artificial sweeteners that seems to linger after you've used it. It does say that it provides 24hr protection but not sure how that works unless you go without eating or drinking for 24hrs? But I do think it is an excellent product and will be buying and using it regularly since it appears to ease any gum problems I have."
5.00,"I wanted to use all the other toothpaste up first, so waited a little before I purchased it, and it was worth the wait. It cleans well and leaves a great feeling on your teeth and gums. Can't wait to see how shiny and white my teeth look after 2 weeks or so. I am happy with how they look only after 1 week."
4.00,"I like Crest's products, but usually find that the \"fresh\" feel/taste doesn't last long- this toothpaste cleans and freshens all day!"
3.00,"Although I think it's a good product, I didn't care for the taste compared to other mouthwashes."
4.00,"I have always liked crest and these new products are in line with the brand. The mouthwash is not too strong yet it still leaves a good clean feeling. The new toothbrush is a bit different looking but is flexible because of it. I specifically like the toothpaste because of the taste and how clean it leaves my teeth. The floss is by far the best on the market. The glide brand does a great job of flossing without getting stuck as much as a thicker waxy floss. Good solid products."
5.00,"Last week I had my bi-annual check-up. My dental hygienist was very happy with me. :)"
4.00,"I love how this toothpaste left my teeth feeling so clean and fresh. Very good product and I would buy it again."
5.00,"I love this stuff--it makes your teeth really slick and white and I noticed decreased sensitivity after just two days. Nice flavor and just a good clean feeling."
5.00,"I absolutly love this product.. It gets you teeth so clean and it is a clean that lasts."
1.00,"It will turn your teeth brown. If you keep using it, your teeth will turn black. Not much more to say than that."
1.00,"I spend a lot of money on my teeth. Dentists, endodontists, oral surgeon, you name it, I've had it done to my teeth. I've spent a fortune on them and a lot, LOT of time at these specialists. I have my teeth cleaned twice a year and I brush twice a day and floss every day. I decided a couple of months ago to add mouthwash to the routine. Since my husband had bought a Crest ProHealth a while back, just figured I'd use that up before buying Listerine (which I've read is the best). Within a month or so of using it daily, I now have brown stains all over my lower teeth!!! I was so freaked out! I used to drink 1/2 a cup of coffee a day, but I even stopped that about 2 months ago, in order to be healthier. I drink nothing but water and club soda, so they cannot blame the teeth stains on my drinks. After looking online and seeing all the complaints about this product, it boggles my mind that this product is still on the shelves!! Come on P&G, do the right thing and get rid of it already!"
5.00,"Crest has done it again! I love the way this toothpaste keeps my teeth feeling clean all day"
1.00,"It says to use 2x a day, but anymore than once every couple of days and my taste buds are killed off as if i've just eaten a whole package of sour patch kids. What kind of mouthwash does that? Don't waste your money on this mouthwash. I now only use it once in a while just so I can avoid ruining my tongue."
4.00,"The mouthwash made my mouth feel fresh and clean. The taste is pleasant also."
4.00,"When it comes to oral hygiene, I have gone through many products. For Crest products, the Pro-Health line uses a Polyfluorite System consisting of therapeutic antibacterial fluoride and ActivClean Crystals for cleaning. With the \"Crest Pro-Health Collection Kit\", you are getting the following products: * Oral-B Pro-Health All-in-One with Cross Action Bristles (Medium) - This is probably one of the best non-mechanical tooth brushes I have used. I have gone through many brushes and usually don't find a great fit, but this tooth brush was so comfortable to use, great grip and great clean! Awesome tooth brush... BUT with that being said, it's only offered with a medium toothbrush and for those who need something smaller or bigger, the inclusion of only a medium toothbrush may be this kit's caveat for one deciding if they should purchase it or not. * Crest Pro-Health Toothpaste - Minty Fresh toothbrush that fights cavities, plaque, gingivitis, builds protection against painful sensitivity, fights tarter, whitens teeth by removing surface stains and freshens breath. I love the aftertaste of this toothbrush and it made me feel that the toothpaste really does a thorough job on your teeth, even after a touch of water, it worked perfectly. * Crest Pro-Health Multi-Protection Rinse - You get a 1 Liter bottle of Crest's Pro-Health Multi-Protection Rinse. No strong aftertaste, no burning of the tongue. Makes you feel that you have fresh breath and it's great protecting for your teeth. * Oral-B Glide Pro-Health Deep Clean Floss - This is the tape version, not the string type that shreds and can get stuck in your teeth. The Pro-Health Deep Clean Floss has up to 90% more micro textured surface area than the Glide Original. Helps prevent gingivitis and provides a cool blast of clean feeling everytime you floss. JUDGMENT CALL: For the four products included the Crest Pro-Health Collection Kit, for my experience it's fantastic! But the reason why I can't give it a perfect five-star rating is because the tooth brush may not be perfect for others mouths. The medium that came with the kit worked perfectly but what if someone needed a toothbrush that was smaller or larger. This is where it would be much better if people had the option to change the size of the toothbrush for the kit. I'm also not too sure what price this kit is set at (at the time of my review, there is no price listed). But hopefully this kit is not overpriced. Overall, for my experience, the four products are fantastic! The floss works great, no shredding (I can't stand shredding floss), the toothpaste is not too watery and feels like it is really cleaning your teeth, the rinse is not too powerful or feel as if it is burning your tongue and the toothbrush, one of the best toothbrushes I have used. Crest Pro-Health products are fantastic but this kit will come down to those who use a medium toothbrush and if the price is just right. 4 Stars!"
4.00,"Left a great, clean feeling in my mouth after using it."
3.00,"I bought two different pro health toothpastes. My husband hates both of them. I just used the sensitive one. It was alright. It cleaned well enough, but didn't give my breath a really fresh scent that I like to have after brushing teeth."
5.00,"I used to try many different mouthwash but I Lways felt I had to rinse twice now with this crest I only use a very small amount and it leaves my mouth feel cleaner."
5.00,"I LOVED this toothpaste! My teeth felt soooo clean and my mouth felt great after using it! My family thought it was great as well; a family favorite! Crest Pro Health ROCKS!"
5.00,"Great mouthwash. You can fee the clean, without the burn. All gain no pain with this one! I love it!"
1.00,"I bought this toothpaste for all the stated benefits, and they did work as advertised. Unfortunately, this toothpaste will also cause the inside of your mouth to peel, leaving you with a gummy white substance to clear out of your mouth. I doubt any toothpaste is supposed to make your skin peel away and it be healthy. I will not be using this product ever again and will be following up with my dentist about the skin peeling issue."
4.00,"Most toothpastes like this do not taste good and do not leave my mouth fresh. I felt like it worked well at cleaning and freshening breath. I like that it did not have a whitening ingredient. I have sensitive teeth and it is very difficult to find a toothpaste like this that does not whiten."
5.00,"It was like I had just left the dentist. The best toothbrush ever."
4.00,"Made my mouth and teeth feel so clean. It lasted longer than most toothpastes I have used in the past."
5.00,"Cleans teeth well and whitens! Good value for the money"
1.00,"My girlfriend and I switched to Crest Pro Health Sensitive + Enamel Shield toothpaste about 3 months ago. I immediately noticed that my lips were chapping more but I thought it was just because with summer here, I was getting dehydrated. Then, when the inside of my cheeks started shredding and peeling CONSTANTLY, I mentioned it to my girlfriend and was amazed when she told me her cheeks and the roof of her mouth were doing the same thing. A little research and I found out the same thing everyone here is complaining about, it's CREST PRO HEALTH TOOTHPASTE that was causing it. We switched to another brand and the problem INSTANTLY went away. Do yourself a favor, like I did. It took me less than a minute researching this online to find hundreds of complaints about the toothpaste doing to all those people exactly the same thing it did to my girlfriend and me. Do you really want to use a toothpaste that destroys the skin in your mouth? I was waking up in the morning with a wad of dead skin in my mouth like it was stick of gum I was chewing! It was disgusting!"
2.00,"I have used Crest products for as long as I can remember. With age and what my dentist calls “overly rambunctious” brushing I needed to switch to a sensitive style of tooth paste. Having always been happy with Crest products I tried Crest Sensitive Shield, Smooth Mint. I am less that enamored with this product. I could deal with the horrible taste, but my mouth/teeth do not feel clean, much less fresh after use. Product packaging is an engineering miss. To close the cumbersome snap on cap you need to hold the tube fairly firmly which dispenses product to the underside of the cap, creating a constant mess. I’m sorry but Sensitive Shield Smooth Mint is a huge miss in my book."
5.00,"My entire family uses this rinse and it's become a part of our brushing routine."
3.00,"I really wanted the gel cinnamon crest. I didn't realize they made it in a paste. My mistake and the toothpaste is OK."
4.00,"Love the taste, not too over powering. It's my new favorite mouthwash"
5.00,"and my teeth look and feel better! Dentist encouraged me to keep using it."
4.00,"I really liked how clean my teeth feel after using this product. Plus, it tastes great!"
5.00,"I have tried many different types of toothpastes and this one by far is the best. My teeth never felt so clean."
5.00,"I love crest products and like the way it feels. i wish the prices of the products were cheaper."
4.00,"Loved this mouth wash it left my mouth feeling fresh and clean. Would buy it again."
1.00,"I read many good reviews about this products and some says the complaints against this one is not true. Well, I have to say that each one is different. You're not experiencing the side effects from this toothpaste doesn't mean we (who complaints) are liars. We just want to warn other peoples so by chance they can avoid the problem that we have. I am pregnant and got gum disease. Just a little swollen on 2 places. I used some salty water to wash my mouth 3 times a day and it really helps. So I wanted to buy some toothpaste that's good for gum too. Some people recommended this Crest PRo-health Gum PRotection so I bought it, hoping it would help. I only used it twice, one time before I went to bed and one time for the next morning. Actually when I checked my mouth before brushing my teeth that morning, I found a lot of mucus like substance in my mouth. IT's disgusting. Had to spend half an hour to take it all out of my mouth. By that time I didn't think the toothpaste caused trouble so I continued brushing my teeth again with the HORRIBLE toothpaste. Immediately when done, I found that my mouth became so dry, especially under the tongue, inner lips and cheeks. And 1hr later, mucus like substance was formed again. Look like i covered my teeth & gum with gummy film. So I did some research and found tons of complaints against this toothpaste. I said Fine, I would throw it away and go back to my old toothpaste. But seemed like my mouth now is paying a good price on trying this thing just twice. 1- Very dry mouth even after stop using Crest Pro-health Gum Protection 2- More gum problems. The salty water almost put away my gum trouble but this thing stripped my gum, made it bloody red and swollen between the teeths. As I said I just got little swollen on 2 places but now almost the gum between my teeths are swollen, rised higher than usual just like I got the advance periodontal disease. 3- mucus like substance still keeps forming but less than when I use that toothpaste. I hope it would be gone in a few days as this is just the first day I stop using the product. 4- Bleeding gum anytime. Before using this, I just got bleeding gum when brushing my teeth so hard. So never use it again."
5.00,"I was a little sketchy trying this mouthwash because I don't like any mouthwashes. Most of them leave a yucky taste afterwards but this one was good, it left the fresh feeling but not an ugly aftertaste. I would definitely buy it."
1.00,"So ithought it was a awesome mouth wash until i just decided to look it up online an just happen to click on the reviews because it had such low reviews an I was like mmh that's weird, so I start reading the reviews an now it's too late my tongue kinda burns an ihave a metallic taste in my mouth awesome..my advice throw it out or get a refund. Idk what to say other than wow.."
3.00,"I liked the taste and consistency but my teeth didn't feel as smooth as I would have liked. I think this toothpaste is above average compared to the other brands available on the store shelves, though."
5.00,"I love the feel of my theeth after using this product. I don't know if I can go back to any other toothpaste."
2.00,"First, I like the floss. This is the floss I always use. It glides well and does not shred. I buy it in bulk package from Costco. I do not like other items in the kit. Both the toothpaste and the rinse have a warning saying that they may cause teeth staining. What is up with that?! I have been using them for two weeks and I am constantly worried about staining. After brushing, I now spend time to examine my teeth to see if they became stained. So far, I don't think they did, but if I see a stain I will blame these products simply because of the warning. Staining of teeth is not something people should worry about when brushing their teeth. Incidentally, SmartMouth rinse states that it will not stain teeth or dentures. I do not want to be concerned with teeth staining when using tooth care products, so I will look for products that do not contain a possibility to cause staining. I have sensitive teeth, so I normally use Sensodine toothpaste which was recommended by every dentist I have seen. Crest Pro-Care toothpaste has never been recommended to me by a dentist, although it claims to help with hyper-sensitivity. I did not notice Crest helping with sensitivity better than Sensodine. According to dentists I visited, teeth sensitivity is a result of tooth enamel erosion. My dentists always recommended SOFT bristled brushes to reduce erosion. The toothbrush included in this kit has MEDIUM bristles, which may promote erosion of the enamel. Crest might have included medium toothbrush to combat the potential staining, but this is just my guess. I do not think that this is a good collection of products because of the potential teeth staining by the toothpaste and the rinse, and because the toothbrush has medium bristles which may promote enamel erosion and increase sensitivity. Additionally, items in this kit will likely run out at different times, so consumers are unlikely to purchase this as a kit more than once. At the time of this review the price is not available, so I cannot comment on value, but I do not see why one would be more interested in buying these products as a kit than individually."
4.00,"I recommend this product because it gives you a nice, clean feeling after you use it. Everyone in my family liked it!"
2.00,"I was excited to try this mouthwash because it is alcohol free, and I used it for a few days with great results as far as a long lasting fresh taste in my mouth, no burning during use, and really clean feeling teeth and gums. I am pregnant and am having inflamed gums due to pregnancy, and this seemed to be helping. However, after 3 days, I developed a feeling that I had just burned my tongue on something really hot and I lost my ability to taste anything. The only thing different was the use of this mouthwash, and when I googled to see if that was a side effect others have suffered, I saw it was pretty widespread! So, I have stopped using it, and it has been two days so far. I still cannot taste anything, but the burning feeling is getting better. The positives of this mouthwash could not outweigh the loss of ability to taste my food, so it is going in the garbage :("
5.00,"My teeth really looked whiter after using this toothpaste. I thought the flavor was good - not to sweet. There is a bit of a \"grit\" to the toothpaste, but it made me feel like my teeth were getting cleaned at the dentist office."
4.00,"I like the gritty texture of this toothpaste. But there are now so many line extensions I get confused. There's whitening, tartar control, and various similar flavors. I can't keep track."
5.00,"Crest has been my only brand for years and i thought it could not get better,but it did,,,Pro-Health toothpaste keeps my teeth clean,white and a just brush feeling for hours...thanx,Crest!"
4.00,"I love this toothpaste. Teeth felt so smooth and clean!"
5.00,"My husband and I just love this product, better even than the regualr crest mouthwash. I is refreshing and lasts."
4.00,"nice flavor, kept my mouth feeling fresh all day long."
3.00,"It is a good product, I just had a hard time with the taste, it tasted very medicine like to me."
4.00,"It really cleans your teeth well and leaves your mouth refreshed. More expensive than other toothpastes, but my teeth are worth it."
4.00,"Very clean feeling after use. Went to the dentist yesterday for cleaning and I was in and out within 30 minutes with next to no plaque build up!"
4.00,"The toothpaste makes your teeth feel clean and refreshed and ready to show off your smile. Depending on the store where the toothpaste is purchased determines the price but overall a very good value for the money"
5.00,"I have used Crest Pro-Health tooth paste and mouth wash for years and I love it. I will not buy anything else. I have never, ever had any staining of my teeth from this product. I have never had my dentist tell me that I have stains, in fact my dentist tells me I have very white teeth (and no I do not whiten my teeth!) I am not sure where the other reviewers are getting these stains from. Perhaps the gallons of coffee, pop/soda, or wine Americans drink in a year. I guess each person has their own results."
3.00,"We have purchased numerous brands of toothpaste over the years, including Colgate, Crest and several others. We used this recently and found this one to be a bit too gritty, almost like an exfoliant, which was a bit too 'pasty' in our mouths. The flavor itself is not bad, but the consistency was a bit irritating. In comparison to other Crest toothpaste product, which also seem more 'sandy' than Colgate for instance, this one was just too gritty for our liking."
5.00,"I really like the feel of my teeth and my mouth overall after I use the Crest Pro-Health Clinical toothpaste. My teeth feel as if they were just polished and the mint flavor is lasting but not overpowering."
4.00,"this product was great it really left my teeth feeling great just after a dentist visit! would deffinately buy again"
5.00,"I love the clean fresh feel in my mouth, great value too!"
5.00,"I love this product this in my favorite toothpaste"
5.00,"Using the Crest products has been a delight to my mouth! They do what they said they would & I plan to continue using them. Thanks, Crest."
5.00,"I loved this rinse. It left my mouth fresh without burning. There is a slightly different \"slippery\" feeling, but nothing bothersome."
4.00,"Love the mouthwash because it does not have that harsh alcohol burn like some do. It is minty and keeps your mouth clean and fresh."
5.00,"I really like this mouthwash! It doesn't burn like typical alcohol-containing mouthwashes, and it makes my mouth feel fresh and clean! Highly recommend!"
1.00,"It doesn't make a difference whether you use the flip-top cap or unscrew the cap, this toothpaste makes a mess! It's gloppy, stringy and horrible. I don't know if Crest decided to use some cheap fillers, such as guar gum, but whatever they did to this toothpaste, it's definitely not worth using. In addition, I saw no difference in my teeth or gums after using this for weeks. It's a terrible product; I'm going back to regular toothpaste. Crest should be ashamed of themselves."
5.00,"My teeth felt clean throughout the whole day! I love this toothpaste!"
5.00,"I, for one, love the new tube design! I have not had any problems with the toothpaste running out of the tube. I like that the lid is an attached flip lid and that I can stand the tube upright. Please don't change it! Oh, and I love the toothpaste also! I have noticed an improvement. Now I need to see what my dentist thinks. Thanks!!"
5.00,"this is a little more runny than other toothpaste so you have to be sure to close the cap tightly. I love how this makes my teeth feel and the flavor is also quite wonderful."
5.00,"I tried the clinical mouthwash and I love it! I like the tingle (not burn) that I felt when using it - not to mention that it kept my mouth feeling fresh for hours. Well worth the cost in my opinion. I will be using again for sure!"
5.00,"This product is great. My teeth feel wonderful. I would definitely purchased it again and I would recommend it to others."
4.00,"The toothpaste made my teeth feel squeaky clean!! very refreshing too!!"
4.00,"I haven't been to the dentist since I started using the new toothpaste - but I am sure there will be a difference. My mouth feels cleaners and my teeth don't feel \"fuzzy\" from plaque."
5.00,"This product worked very well at removing plaque and giving me fresh breath so it has already been added to my monthly shopping list. I would suggest this specific toothpaste to anyone who wants great smelling breath at an affordable price because it really does improve your hygiene."
5.00,"The Crest Pro-Health toothpaste and rinse are what I use and I won't be switching brands anytime soon! These seem to get my mouth the cleanest and freshest for the longest period of time! I definetly recommend giving these a try!!"
5.00,"I absolutely loved this product it really worked. My husband also tried it and was very happy with it."
5.00,"Well I think many toothpastes are good for you and always getting better so why this one stands out if it tastes amazing! It is a bit pricey at almost $5 for small tube but I can't find locally very often so I'm buying in bulk here on amazon."
5.00,"Been using this toothpaste for almost a year now. I absolutely love the taste and the clean feeling. Good stuff!"
3.00,"I thought I ordered the clear liquid, not the blue. The clear has been discontinued and amazon is sneaky in the footnotes that they may alter which one they send you. P&G is changing the clear liquid version to a different assortment and more expensive, and the color can stain plaque on the teeth, so brush carefully."
5.00,"I tried this mouthwash and was surprised by the pleasant flavor. It also left my mouth feeling incredibly clean and fresh."
5.00,"This toothpaste left a fresh, clean taste and feel that lasted for a long time."
5.00,"It has great flavor and works great. I love the flip top - it's a minor but important feature!"
4.00,"I really like this mouthwash, it kept my breath fresh throughout the day"
5.00,"This made my mouth feel so clean that that night I had a dream that Brad Pitt kissed me and my mouth was super fresh!"
1.00,"Our household is normally a Listerine household. The spouse loves it, but it burns so bad for me! I love the clean feeling of mouthwash, but have not always been faithful with my daily rinsing because of the burning (and drooling) it causes me. So I thought I'd give this a swish and see how I liked it.Flossed, brushed, and grabbed the bottle. I poured half a capfull and tossed it back. Swish swish swish. Spit. There were chunks of blue in the sink. ?! This was odd. My toothpaste is white, so I was sure it was not that. Close inspection of my teeth shows little blue globs of this mouthwash was hanging out all over the place. It's coated on my tongue, so that my entire tongue is blue, and when I try to rinse / brush my mouth out, it creates a strange foam out of nothing.Because I didn't have enough the first go round, I assumed it was a fluke, so I rinsed again. Swish swish swish. Spit. Chunks of blue in the sink and all over my teeth. Another blue tongue.Two hours later and I'm eating crackers with a sour cream dip and I can hardly taste anything. I have a strange chemical feeling on my tongue and gums.Back to Listerine and all the burning, drooling, eye watering glory it provides me."
4.00,"This toothpaste is fine. I don't really notice a huge difference between one toothpaste to another."
1.00,"Stannous fluoride in this product can stain your teeth yellow -- even with the \"whitening agent. Go for the sodium fluoride in another paste."
4.00,"We will see if it really works on the next cleaning at the dentist, but I like the way it makes me teeth feel"
5.00,"ALL i can say is my daughter loved it she told me I had to buy this for her . So needless to say I did, then i tried it , WE are switching toothpastes. thanks for the sample."
4.00,"This toothpaste provides a great clean. Crest has great products that I would recommend."
5.00,"My teenage son requested a mouthwash that wasn't nasty tasting. I purchased the Crest Pro Health Clinical and gave it to him. It left his breath fresh smelling, teeth shiny and a smile on his face. Thank you"
4.00,"I couldn't believe all the bad reviews I love this product,would have given 5 stars but have to admit it does alter the taste for a while, even water tastes funny for a while after using this, but the cleaning results are fantastic, it looks like it basically sucks the placke from teeth and tongue, the white stuff kind off shrinks together and you just spit it out and rinse with water, and your mouth feels a LOT cleaner afterwards, I had a lot of cavities before but no more since I use this mouthwash, it's so aggressive on the germs, I can live with a little funny taste, and no burning at all,...."
4.00,"I loved the samples I received! My whole family thought our mouths felt fresh and clean. Great product!!"
5.00,"I love Crest Pro-Health toothpaste. The texture is great. The flavors are great. My teeth feel fabulously clean after I brush. I like the cap too. Crest Pro-Health is the toothpaste that is now found in my house!!!"
5.00,"After using, my mouth feels fresh for hours. I like knowing I am getting extra protection from plaque all day, too. I recommend!"
4.00,"I love Crest but the clinical left my teeth feeling really smooth and clean. I liked the taste as well as the feel. I would recommend this product and have already"
5.00,"i bought this product for my husband and he loves it for shaving every day can create a toll on his skin. so guys dont think that creams are a woman thing for men also can benefit from it so taking care of your body also entails your skin."
4.00,"I have always used Crest- since I was a kid and now buy it for my family. This product males my teeth feel good and smooth. It is a quality product."
3.00,"I usually love Crest but I'm not a huge fan of the pro-relief. I feel like the taste is off and it leaves my mouth feeling pretty gross. I wish it tasted better."
4.00,"Overall, I liked this product. It is refreshing toothpaste and it doesn't have a funky aftertaste though I found it a bit gritty."
5.00,"I tried the pro-health toothpaste. It had a good taste and left my teeth smooth and feeling clean"
5.00,"Kept my mouth feeling fresh much longer than most products.will definitely buy again"
3.00,"It bubbles white in my entire mouth for a long time which makes it taste funny, but I ave really white teeth now. So I would buy it again!"
5.00,"Our family loves crest prohealth toothpaste. My husband and I always have good check-ups with our dentist thanks to the help of crest toothpaste."
4.00,"I like the taste and texture of the toothpaste. The design of the flip top makes it easier to open and use - a great improvement. As of yet, I don't notice the sensitivity reducing but I've only used it a week so far and should see results."
5.00,"I love this! Fresh feeling for hours!! I could tell it worked for a long time."
5.00,"A great addition to my morning routine. I'm always searching for that little something extra. Thanks."
5.00,"The toothpaste cleans great. It is a bit gritty but the results are fantastic."
3.00,"They need to fix the staining issue. But if you do use this product, be sure to have your mouth fairly clean before using it, and rinse extremely well after using it. I use this product sometimes, and I rinse a lot. Otherwise, if you use it a lot, you will feel the residue. Don't use this product independent of brushing and without rinsing thoroughly. It's also good to alternate and not use the same mouthwash forever, then you can minimize side effects of each product."
5.00,"The best toothpaste I have every used. Leaving my mouth feeling clean and fresh."
3.00,"After reading some of the reviews on this product I asked my dentist if the product caused staining of the teeth. She said it does in some people and that her office no longer gives out samples of the toothpaste or the mouth rinse. It is not possible to know which people will be affected by the stannous floride in this product: she can use it but her sister has the staining issue which while not permanent can be annoying. One would wonder why Crest hasn't changed the formula of this toothpaste. I have used Crest products for years but would not recommend this one."
5.00,"I love the oral b glide floss. It's smooth on my teeth and easy to pull out. Some other floss kind of get stuck between my teeth but not oral b glide floss. Thanks"
4.00,"This mouthwash is great. It has a ton of bubbles and certainly leaves the mouth feely fresh. I am kind of senstive to flouride so I have to be careful using this mouthwash. It is great on cuts inside the mouth. I certainly would recommend this."
5.00,"best quality- i've tried other sale brands before and none of them feel as clean."
4.00,"Teeth feel clean and fresh. I would definitely buy this product again."
4.00,"This is an effective toothpaste for sensitive teeth, really helps. Would give it 5 stars except that it is VERY hard to squeeze out; you end up wrestling with the tube. An improvement would be to make it a little less thick."
5.00,"I love this mouthwash. I had been looking for a good mouthwash for quit a while and now I've found it. It keeps my mouth feeling fresh for hours after I've used it, even after I eat."
4.00,"Everyone in my family loves the new Crest Prohealth toothpaste. My husband now won't use anything else, and the kids like it better than the fruit flavored stuff they usually use. It really makes my teeth feel clean, too!"
5.00,"I love the product it helps whiten your teeth, tastes great and very affordable to purchase. I love how it leaves my breath fresh and a clean feeling."
5.00,"I bought this toothpaste with Jake on the label because it matches the Oral-B Pro-Health Stages Jake power kids toothbrush. I've bought this same toothpaste in the store, but never saw Jake on the outside before. My 4-year-old is going to be very excited! I wish I could have used a coupon, like I can in the store. But it's supply and demand... I haven't seen this in the store, but I found it on Amazon."
4.00,"My teeth are incredibly sensitive and often hurt just by wind blowing on them. Since I have been using this mouthwash I have noticed a big difference. My teeth aren't as sensitive and they don't hurt as much either. Great product!"
4.00,"all toothpastes work really. but this Crest was pretty darn good. my teeth felt squeeky clean all day. Crest is the brand i prefer to buy most of the time."
5.00,"Did a good job of keeping my teeth feeling clean even through the occasional snack and/or drink."
1.00,"If it is, it's not funny. I purchased this after analyzing the box and the claims it made about dental health, etc. I used it twice before searching the internet to see if I wasn't the only person to experience bizarre problems with this toothpaste. Both times I used it, my cheeks and gums appeared to lighten up by many shades while I simultaneously felt a drying, chemical-y sensation to my whole mouth. It was so intense I thought I was having an allergic reaction the second time. Afterward, my mouth was full of dead cheek/gum tissue. It was really frightening. I've had that happen to a lesser extent in the past but, never as bad as with this toothpaste. I had to pull it out of my dry, numbed mouth in gobs with my fingers. To top it off, my mouth seriously felt anesthetized for some time after use. Also, my gums bled more while I brushed than with any other toothpaste. Then my teeth hurt so much where my gums bled! I honestly can't help but think of some horror movie where I've been poisoned and my teeth are falling out. It reminds me of the effects drugs or radiation have on people! This is a terrible product, please save your money and sense of well-being by not purchasing this."
5.00,"This mouthwash works and does a great job. Very good product."
4.00,"The pre rinse not only helps with whitening but also freshens breath."
4.00,"I really liked this mouthwash. It left my mouth feeling clean and fresh alot long than most I have used in the past."
1.00,"This Crest \"Pro-Health Complete\" does a great job freshening my breath, but at the expense of being able to taste food normally for hours after using it. There are a lot of other reviewers with the same experience, so it seems to effect a lot of people the same way.                                                                     We have already stopped using this and will not go back to it.                                                                     CFH"
4.00,"This toothpaste wasn't that different from other brands as far as how it tasted and felt in my mouth, but it was noticeably different in the way it made my mouth itself feel. My teeth felt both smooth and clean much longer than with my regular toothpaste."
5.00,"I love the flavor of this stuff. It really leaves my mouth feeling fresh. I love the texture of this, though it can be hard to get it on your upper teeth because it's thin. If you have an electric brush, it's going to get everywhere, but if you clean your bathroom regularly, that's not a huge deal ;) I was recommended this toothpaste by my dentist to help reverse gum problems. I still need to get back for a checkup, but this doesn't make my gums bleed, where a lot of other pastes do."
4.00,"This is a great toothpaste. It has a great cinnamon flavor, whitner, tarter control and sensitivity feature. Also a great price."
5.00,"I really like this product! At first, I had to get used to the almost gritty feel of the toothpaste, but after a few days, I didn't even notice it. It has left my teeth and my whole mouth feel so clean!!! Love it!1"
4.00,"This toothpaste left my mouth and teeth feeling so clean."
3.00,"used the sample, really makes your mouth feel fresh and clean"
3.00,"Crest Pro-Health Night is my favorite mouthwash. It's one of the few on the market that isn't icky sweet. I've been using it for several years, and have not had any problems with it staining my teeth. However, beware that this item listing is for the small 250ml bottles, not the larger 1 liter bottles sold elsewhere on Amazon. Nowhere in the item listing does it note the size. I'd never even seen bottles of Crest Pro-Health this small until they showed up in my order. It's deceptive for the listing not to specific the size. UPDATE June 2011: Amazon has now properly revised this item listing to include the \"8.4 ounce\" size info."
5.00,"The tooth paste left me teeth feeling very clean. Even after I ate a meal, my teeth still felt clean."
5.00,"I loved the way my mouth felt after using this product."
3.00,"We use the crest prohealth products. This particular product leaves my mouth feeling numb for quite a while afterward. It's almost like using listerine mouth wash. I'm not sure if I would purchase this particular prohealth tooth paste again."
5.00,"I was very impressed with this rinse. I do notice the difference of the plaque build-up on my teeth."
5.00,"L love the way my mouth feels after using tis product, No burning sensation just cool fresh breath. Great feeling with no aftertaste."
5.00,"I have noticed a huge difference in the feeling in my mouth since using this crest mouthwash,I feel cleaner and my gums feel better my whole family is using this."
5.00,"Love this product. Refreshing and clean feeling. Will def. buy again!"
1.00,"It is May 6, 2013 and I have just returned home from an hour in the dentist's chair having my teeth scaled (scraped) and then sand-blasted with a sodium bicarbonate fine powder. Not pleasant. This was because of horrible brown stains that had appeared between my teeth where the teeth touch each other. It looked like I had food stuck in my teeth. My dentist took one look and said, \"Have you been using Crest Pro-Health?\" I said, \"Yes, for about two months.\" He explained that, for some people, it causes brown staining. I fall into that unlucky group. I read the back of the bottle and it does warn of possible staining, but says good brushing should take care of it. NOT TRUE. I am a religious brusher and flosser, but that didn't help at all. Only a professional cleaning at the dentists will get rid of this mess. Looking online, I see hundreds (thousands?) of others have had similar experiences dating back years. Why are they still selling it? Avoid this product at all cost."
5.00,"This product is GREAT! It leaves your mouth feeling fresh and clean without irritating or burning like other mouthwash."
5.00,"This toothpaste left my mouth and teeth feeling fresh and clean."
5.00,"I just love this Crest Pro-Health. Combines many features such as whitening, mouth freshener, anti cavity and mainly sensitivity into one toothpaste. I tried the Crest Pro-Health Enamel and that made most of my gum peel off. Any other person might have switched the brands completely. I decided to give the plain \"Crest Pro-Health\" a chance (Not the \"Crest Pro-Health Enamel). Now I love this toothpaste. 5 stars in my book."
4.00,"I like that this mouthwash does not burn like the others due to the alcohol free."
4.00,"I like the taste but most of all, I feel it did a good job at getting my teeth clean."
4.00,"I love the mouthwash but the price is kinda high. I like it because it doesn't burn your mouth and the taste is not overpowering. I have not noticed much in terms of whiting but with more uses I hope to see results."
3.00,"Pros:                                              -good cleaning                                              -decent taste                                              -good all rounder                                                                     Cons:                                              -too abrasive which results in stripping away of mucous membranes.                                              -does nothing for bad breath                                              -increased sensitivity                                              --------------------------------------------------------------------                                                                     I didn't notice the staining of the teeth others complained about.                                                                     I am using NEEM ACTIVE  which is a toothpaste manufactured in India and licensed by German co. Henkel. It is very good and my breath doesn't stink at all in the morning. Only problem is that it's expensive. The indian stores will rip you off and it's pretty expensive on amazon too and it's not 100 percent natural.                                                                     I found colgate total very effective too but I read conflicting reports on triclosan, the main ingredient in colgate total.                                                                     I hope my review helped."
5.00,"As with any product labeled \"50+\", I have no way to evaluate the effectiveness in the short term. The packaging states that this is a \"fluoride toothpaste for anticavity, antigingivitis and sensitive teeth\", and that \"it defends against dental conditions people over 50 experience\". At 66, with a mouth full of crowns, I will trust that this is good for me! It certainly can't hurt. The marketing department has captured another consumer....and yes, it does taste good."
1.00,"I started using this on the advise of my oral hygenist. Every morning I wake up with these gross mouth strings. I have quit using it and hope this problem goes away."
5.00,"Tried and loved the Crest Pro-health clinical plaque control toothpaste. Total dental clean perfect feeling and results!"
4.00,"The toothpaste did leave my mouth feeling especially clean. However, the taste was off. The taste is a pretty big deal to me. Maybe other people would like it. I would not purchase this product again based solely on the taste. I am more likely to stick with what I know works and tastes good."
5.00,"Had a very plesent taste and seemed to do the job well. Will definetly be buying this more for my family to use!"
2.00,"I have the same issues with this as I do with the new Listerine Zero-- altered taste, and about 30 minutes after I use it I start having the skin inside my mouth peel off-- kind of like when you eat pizza that is too hot and you burn the roof of your mouth.                                                                     I can't say I'd recommend this to someone who is taste sensitive, or at least buy a small unit first to test it out before committing to this larger purchase."
3.00,"Crest Pro-Health Multiprotection Clean Mint Rinse is a somewhat mild tasting , alcohol free, mouth wash. It doesn't burn like some mouth washes, but it did seem to make my mouth feel a little numb. I use Crest Crest Pro Health Cool Wintergreen Mouth Wash, and it does not do this. Like another popular brand, Crest Pro Health Mouth Wash kills 99% of common germs that can cause plaque, gingivitis and bad breath. Crest Pro-Health Multiprotection Clean Mint Rinse isn't bad, but there are others I like better."
4.00,"It made my mouth felt really clean after brushing my teeth."
5.00,"This is a great mouthwash that kept my teeth feeling clean and my breath fresh. I appreciated that it didn't burn like other brands."
5.00,"I was delighted to see the Crest Pro-Health gum formula. My son wears braces and has been encouraged by his orthodontist to pay special attention to the gumlines above and below his brackets. I am hoping this formula of Crest can aid in his teen dental hygiene. I have heard many stories about how careless brushing with braces can lead to gun disease and I want my \"always-in-a-rush\" teenager to get a Crest advantage."
3.00,"My teeth felt clean afterwards, but really it does with all the toothpastes I've used. I didn't feel like it cleaned my teeth any better or that the fresh breath lasted any longer. I would recommend it, because it did indeed work; it just wasn't any better than others on the market."
1.00,"After using this rinse with toothpaste a week. I am losing my taste sense. I am a really avereage person who doesn't have sepecific allegy. This product is dangerous!"
5.00,"I love how this toothpaste tastes and I makes me love brushing my teeth even more."
4.00,"I liked how this product was not overpowering or burned when I used it. I did, however, feel that it was a bit watery in taste, but it left my mouth feeling clean and fresh, so I'm happy."
5.00,"I have long felt that Crest is a good and dependable brand."
5.00,"Crest toothpaste is the best. I tried it and it was amazing. Definitely will buy this toothpaste for now on."
1.00,"I bought this product three days ago.  The first night I used it, I thought it was great.  My mouth had that wonderful fresh and clean feeling.  I used it the next morning, and while I was at work I noticed that my gums seemed to be burning, and that my tongue felt raw.  I dismissed it and thought it was just something I needed to get used to.  I used it again at night.  I awoke in the middle of the night because my gums were burning so badly.  When I woke up, my upper gums were still sore.  It hurts to smile and pucker.                                                                     Also, I ate popcorn at the movie theater yesterday and it didn't taste very good because I couldn't taste anything.  The mouthwash had effectively destroyed my sense of taste.                                                                     This is the worst mouthwash I have ever tried and I am absolutely going to fight to get my money back.  I'm never buying another Crest mouthwash again.  This shouldn't even be available on the market.                                                                     I haven't noticed the brown stains side effect.  Even so, that side effect should be listed much more prominantly.  I noticed it on the bottle and assumed it meant white stains, and figured that since it wasn't permanent it wasn't too terrible of a side effect.  However, since the product seems to be staining people's teeth brown, which is a far more noticable and less desireable stain, Crest really should make consumers aware of the side effects."
4.00,"Love the way this left my mouth feeling! Fresh and clean!!!"
5.00,"I love the toothpaste. It makes your teeth and mouth feel clean!"
5.00,"I use crest more than any other toothpaste. This one had good taste and makes my mouth feel really fresh and clean."
5.00,"Nothing like fresh breath to make you feel better and more confident. I thought this rinse was very fresh. And, the older I get, the more I know I need to keep a watch out for gingivitis and plaque. I would definitely recommend. Thanks for the chance to try it out!"
5.00,"Had no problems with this mouthwash. I really like it and think it's held up my teeth and gums well. To be honest i don't brush my teeth as often as i should on some days, but i always usually mouthwash with this product and at my last 6 month checkup i got a clean bill of health and the Doctor said, \"Whatever you're doing, keep it up\", although i did have quite a bit of plaque build up (which they cleaned off). We can't really afford the expensive other mouthwash's and i think the price is great for this one. It does sting a bit (which is to be expected) but other than that i don't have any problems with it. I think the blue color will stain our teeth somewhat, which is a little annoying, since i think they could make it in white or clear. But overall, in my opinion, this is a 5 star product. Kinda odd to see so many negative reviews. I guess  i'm the odd man out."
5.00,"I'm a believer, and will keep using it."
5.00,"We are a Crest household and I love this product! It makes your mouth feel fresh and your teeth has that clean polished feel to them."
5.00,"This was a great product to use on my teeth. My mouth felt so fresh and clean. Def would reccomend this product!"
5.00,"Excellent price and an outstanding product. Needed sensitive toothpaste and this far exceeded by expectations. Gentle on the gums and prevents any irritation I would receive from extremely cold foods and drinks. Dentist recommended a sensitive toothpaste and I have noticed a huge improvement since using this. I am a long time user and the excellent price makes it a great bargain."
3.00,"Overall, I do like this toothpaste, but honestly, I doubt I'll ever get it again. The operative word in toothpaste here is the 'paste;' this stuff is very thick and gritty, like someone didn't thoroughly stir and smooth out a powdered mix. It's a little gritty and crunchy if you bite down while brushing. And it's certainly not smooth and easy to rinse out either. I much prefer a pleasing gel; like Crest with Scope Outlast Toothpaste or Colgate MaxFresh with breathstrips mixed into the toothpaste. Either of those 2 is far more appealing to me than this under-mixed sand called Crest Pro-Health. According to the box, this toothpaste addresses most every oral condition one could want -- all except flavor and pleasing consistency. MaxFresh and Outlast are both far superior to use and leave my breath feeling fresh for hours. By comparison, this Pro-Health one just doesn't come close. Guess it's just not for me, though I imagine some might really like it."
4.00,"Nice product, but it seems a bit expensive in the stores."
1.00,"This toothpaste makes the skin on the inside of my mouth peel. It also makes my mouth very dry. The flavor could be stronger. It doesn't keep my breath fresh very long at all."
4.00,"We have gone through 2 bottles and i will continue to purchase it as it seems like it is doing a good job of adding just that extra cleaning after brushing that we are looking for."
5.00,"My mouth felt so clean! Loved it. Will purchase again."
5.00,"Taste was pleasant and made my mouth feel fresh and clean. No burning that often occurs with other products."
5.00,"Great product. Mouth feels clean and fresh w/o bad taste."
5.00,"My familys new tooth paste. Everyone felt refreshed and the nest part of all is when I told my dentiost it is what he recomments"
5.00,"what i liked most about this product is it didn't burn your mouth"
5.00,"There's is almost a grit to the this paste, but it feels like an extra scrubbing agent. Love it!"
5.00,"I have used all of the products and will definitely buy them again! : ) I have always enjoyed Crest products!!"
4.00,"it leaves your mouth feeling clean and refreshed and because it contains no alchol my son teenage son even uses it"
1.00,"This toothpaste needs to be avoided. The front part of my tongue has become all tingly and numb to taste. The tingle sensation is similar to tasting a corrosive metal if that makes any sense. My lips also have started to tingle and chap. I have never had such a negative experience with toothpaste before."
4.00,"I liked this mouthwash because it doesn't burn your mouth, has a great clean taste and I love that it really cleans your whole mouth."
5.00,"I've been using crest for years, decades actually, and I go to the dentist about every two or three years. I brush with crest and electric tooth brush and I floss. I rarely need any kind of plaque scraping and my gums are in great shape. So the combination works for me. This new \"Pro Health\" version smells yummy, feels great and crest is long time well known name, so I'm guessing it does what it says it does. I would definitely recommend it and will continue to purchase it for myself and my family."
5.00,"there was a complete difference in the whiteness of my family and my teeth for once they actually said it works but without the coplaining the taste"
5.00,"This product is something I would use for my mouth any day of the week. It is something that helps my bad breath as well."
5.00,"I love the toothpaste. It left my teeth feeling clean and has greatly improved the appearance of my gum and teeth."
5.00,"I highly recommend this toothpaste. Once you try it, your teeth will feel super slick and clean! Just try it and give your mouth a makeover!"
5.00,"I love the flavor and texture of this product but I don't like the cap on the tube. My wife believes in using every last drop of toothpaste and with this cap it's hard to get all the product out. It's also sometimes hard to close. Fix this and I'll give you all 5's."
4.00,"The Crest Pro-Whitening Fresh Clean Mint Toothpaste left my mouth feeling really clean. My mouth actually felt cleaner after using this product then most toothpastes. The mint taste is pleasant and not too strong. I like the flip top cap, the fact the top does not come off means I don't have to find it when I drop it on the floor. Though it is billed as a whitening toothpaste, I have used it for over a month in conjunction with Crest 3D White mouthwash and the effects have been negligible at best. Not sure how long that whitening part takes. But my mouth does feel cleaner and fresher."
5.00,"I love new Crest Pro-Health Toothpaste! This toothpaste makes my teeth feel extremely clean and my breath fresh! I love the little crystals in the toothpaste, this makes me feel like my toothpaste is really working to clean and freshen."
5.00,"Love how clean and smooth my teeth feel after using this toothpaste. It's my new favorite toothpaste!"
5.00,"My teeth felt so clean and it tasted great! Can't wait to try the other Crest products."
5.00,"Crest is my favorite and my \"go to\" brand for toothpaste"
5.00,"I purchased the clinical gum protection & love it! It tastes good & my teeth feel so clean."
5.00,"My daughter tried the toothbrush and absolutely loved it. She said her teeth felt so clean after using."
5.00,"I never used to use a mouth wash but I really like to keep my mouth clean, fresh and healthy. I brush, floss and use Crest Pro Health Clinical mouthwash x2 daily. It has made a big difference in my overall health of my gums and teeth. This mouthwash used in conjunction with brushing and flossing will make both you and your dentist quite happy."
5.00,"I tried, the tooth paste, tooth brush and the mouth wash and my mouth feels so clean as if i just stepped out of the dentist office...Love it <3"
5.00,"I have a few fillings and love this toothpaste! I am super picky cause i dont want anything to harsh on my filling. I love this toothpaste and will keep buying it!!"
4.00,"the product worked well and didnt have an offensive taste,,,the price was very high so i had good expectations for the product"
5.00,"My teeth have never felt cleaner. The taste was good, too. I love how long the freshness lasts."
4.00,"The Crest ProHealth has a great taste and works well. It makes my mouth feel cleaner longer and my teeth feel smooth."
1.00,"This stained my teeth horribly. Avoid it like the plague. I used it for a month and then I noticed my bottom teeth were brown with dark brown in between each. This is ridiculous. Google this product and \"brown stains\" or \"staining\". Crest has had hundreds of complaints about this product but still does not remove it from the shelves. FDA won't remove it because it's not life threatening ... stained teeth won't kill you but it will kill you're confidence. Crest needs to do the right thing and remove it. Obviously doing the right thing is not in their dictionary. Because their is complaints on this product going back several years. Very Sad! Don't believe me check all the other reviews on Amazon about Crest Pro-Health mouthwash - let others tell you how it browned their teeth as well. Just FYI ... Good luck!"
5.00,"it was a very great product make my mouth feel very clean"
5.00,"I liked this toothpaste a lot, the flavor was great and it left your mouth clean"
4.00,"I was an avid Sensodyne user until my dentist mentioned trying Crest Pro-Health as it should do everything Sensodyne does and more. Crest Pro-Health is taming my sensitivity and controlling the plaque build-up at the same time."
5.00,"I Love the Crest Pro Health toothpaste. I notice a difference every time I use it. My teeth feel cleaner and my mouth feels so fresh after using it. this is my favorite toothpaste!"
5.00,"Great product. Your teeth feel quite clean and your breath smells great. I would highly recommend this product for your teeth."
5.00,"Very impressed with all the products!!! Would recommend this product to family and friends!!!"
5.00,"I love how clean my teeth feel after a visit to the dentist. This toothpaste keeps them feeling that way!"
4.00,"I used it for a week and my mouth feels clean and fresh"
5.00,"This helped to improve the health of my teeth and gums. Plus, it gave me fresh breath. I love this product!!!!!\""
5.00,"i reallyenjoyed using these products. each one left me feeling fresher and cleaner than what i have used in the past"
5.00,"I loved the way it made my mouth feel so clean and minty. It seems as though you can feel it working after you use it."
4.00,"I thought this product was consistent with the other Crest products I've used. It leaves your mouth feeling refreshingly clean, and your teeth, pearly white!"
5.00,"Crest Pro Health toothpaste was given to me as a sample by my Dentist, I have been using this brand for the last eight years. Only toothpaste I'll buy!"
5.00,"Over the years, I have tried many brands of dental products including pricy so-called \"natural\" ones from healthfood stores and mail-order places, but I always come back to Crest. Why? Because Crest is good at what it does: it provides good products at reasonable prices. I seldom use mouthwash and could have done without the neon blue color, but this one was pretty good and being alcohol-free was a huge plus. The paste and brush were good, but the dental floss was my favorite product hands-down. If you are wondering how anyone can rave about dental floss, then I suggest you try this one. This glides in and out so easily between my teeth and best of all, there is no shredding or wax particles left behind. Amazing! I loved receiving this package and wish I could have gotten 10 more."
4.00,"Tried the sensitive formula. Loved it!. My teeth felt clean after brushing, and by the time I was halfway through the first tube, I did notice that I was starting to have much less sensitivity to a specific tooth. By the end of the tube, Crest had another convert. I will stick with the sensitive as it works as well as a much pricier sensitive-tooth toothpaste. I was frankly quite surprised at how well it actually worked on not only my sensitive-tooth issue, but in keeping that just-brushed feeling in my mouth."
5.00,"Yummy berry scented breath... that's my favorite part of bedtime now. When my daughter gives me a kiss goodnight, her breath smells like berries, thanks to this toothpaste! Jake and the Neverland Pirates is a hit in our house, so the toothpaste is also a hit. Anything to help motivate kids to brush, right?"
5.00,"The first toothpaste my little girl didn't complain about how it tasted. Great bargain as well. When the kid is happy, we are all happy!"
5.00,"My teeth really felt clean and polished. I will tell others to try it."
5.00,"I like this toothpaste. It leaves my mouth feeling clean, without too much of a strong, overpowering mint flavor like others I've tried. I also like the texture: somewhere in between paste and gel, with flecks of minti-ness that make me feel like I'm getting a really good cleaning."
1.00,"Never in a million years would I think I would have such strong feelinsg toward a toothpaste. I bought this product about 3 weeks ago and immediately after using it noticed stringy pieces of white skin on the insides of my mouth. Especially in the morning. Terribly gross and I could not for the life of me figure out what was causing this. Finally I remembered that i had just bought a new toothpaste. I searched online to see if anyone else had problems with is and low and behold I found many sites where people had the EXACT SAME PROBLEMS. One lady said her son had to have a skin graft done because the toothpaste had eroded the gum enough to expose the root of a tooth. I immediately threw the product away and of course the problems went away.This may be an allergic reaction that some people have, but I have never ever had this problem with any other toothpaste. This product should come with a warning and many people say it should be removed from shelves. If you choose to use it, please keep an eye out for problems!!"
5.00,"I am a loyal Crest user, and this product will make me switch from my usual Crest toothpaste to this one. My mouth felt so clean!"
5.00,"What an extra clean feeling. Usea it for a week and definitely saw a difference."
5.00,"I don't usually use this type of product, but I will now. It made my mouth feel clean and healthy. It also made my mouth fresh for a very long time."
5.00,"I'm a crest girl all the way, this was a great product!!"
5.00,"I work with the public, so having atrocious breath is a big no no. I've tried many rinses, but this one works LONGER and doesn't burn! I will definitely recommend this mouthwash to everyone!"
5.00,"Was great! My mouth was clean and fresh. I have sensitive teeth and it was perfect!"
5.00,"My teeth have never felt cleaner! This product does a great job of giving you that 'just left the dentist' feeling that lasts for days."
5.00,"Pleasant taste, fresh breath, clean feeling teeth, good toothpaste."
5.00,"I love Crest! My dentist does too! I will continue to use!"
5.00,"This makes your mouth feel clean all day as if you just left the dentist's office."
4.00,"The toothpaste is excellent quality and leaves your teeth feeling very clean. Personally I like a hot, minty flavor so I kind of missed that taste, but it was not an unpleasant taste by any means. The mouthwash was wonderful. It lasted for several hours and left my mouth feeling very refreshed. I used it again after lunch when I do not have time to brush. It leaves my mouth feeling clean and my breath refreshing. I would recommend both of these products."
5.00,"Made my mouth feel fresh and clean! Exactly what is is supposed to do!"
5.00,"I actually only bought this mouthwash because it was purple, and I love purple, so why wouldn't I love a purple mouthwash? It works great. I use it every night after I brush my teeth and in the mornings when I'm running late and don't have time to brush my teeth. It doesn't burn my mouth (thankfully) and I don't get morning breath, which is great."
4.00,"This is one of the best mouthwashes I've ever encountered. It' refreshing, and makes my mouth feel really clean. It even helps keep my teeth strong and healthy. What could be better?"
3.00,"I grew up using crest so I trust the brand. I liked the taste and felt that it did a good job cleaning my teeth and leaving my mouth feeling good"
4.00,"The Crest Pro-Health Clinical Plaque Control toothpaste left my mouth feeling clean and protected. I really feel that I'm doing the best that I can for the health of my teeth and mouth by using this toothpaste!"
5.00,"Though I haven't been to the dentist for my cleaning since I've gotten the toothpaste, my teeth feel very clean after using it."
5.00,"The only two cons for me is that it left a bit of an after taste and the price."
5.00,"I brush my teeth at least 20x a day (yes OCD) and this toothpaste is amazing!"
3.00,"This is an Ok product. It seems to be healthy for your teeth, and the taste when you're using it is good, but after you use it,there seems to be this strong metallic after-taste. It is alcohol free, which is good, but sometimes the devil you know is better than the one you don't. Though it has some advantages over Listerine products, overall I would rank it below Listerine."
5.00,"Love the clean feeling it gives my teeth!! makes me wanna smile even more!!"
5.00,"I tried this mouthwash thinking it was going to be like all the others, but it really cleans your mouth. Not only do my teeth look great, my gums and tongue are left sparkling too! Every time I use this mouthwash, I feel great about how clean my mouth is when I leave the bathroom."
5.00,"I enjoyed the freshness and left my teeth feeling clean."
1.00,"After finishing the second bottle, my wife said it looked like some of my teeth were rotting because they were stained so badly. It took over an hour in the chair at the dentist office for her to scrape all of that staining off my teeth, and I have NEVER had stained teeth before in my life! The dental hygienist said she had several patients who never had staining before begin to have staining when they started using this product. In some fairness, it does say on the back of the bottle in little tiny letters that this product may cause staining. For me, I will never use another Crest product at all!"
5.00,"I was very pleased with this toothpaste. Felt like it was working wonders on my smile!"
4.00,"We have been using this product for a couple of months, and none of us in the family have experienced the numb tongue or altered taste issue mentioned by other reviewers, but we are continuing to evaluate. Our dentist actually recommended this product to us, particularly because our oldest son just got braces. I use it twice per day, and just have not experienced the staining or other issues. It does help with my kids' oral hygiene (better breath), but will update the review if we start experiencing adverse side effects."
5.00,"I like this mouth wash it does not make my mouth burn like some of the competitors do."
5.00,"I love this toothpaste. It makes my mouth feel SO clean and the feeling seems to last longer than it does with other pastes."
4.00,"I felt my teeth was much cleaner after using this."
5.00,"After using this toothpaste, I noticed that my mouth and breath felt very clean long after I brushed!"
3.00,"I have grown up using Crest toothpaste. This is the only type of toothpaste my father would use, with that I now only use Crest. Well, I smoke and I thought that the whitening toothpaste would work wonders on my teeth and the yellow tint from smoking, and it did. The only thing I'm disappointed with is the taste isn't the taste I remember growing up with. Also, the fact that I can go brush my teeth, they feel clean, look clean, but my breath isn't the best :( Also, I have hard time handling the grit, it feels like I'm brushing with baking soda. (If I wanted to do that I would) Anyways, I love Crest, just wish the whitening that works so well on my stains, worked better on my breath. :("
5.00,"It really made my mouth feel really clean !!! Would buy again !!!"
5.00,"I love these pastes, it's cleansing and tastes great"
5.00,"The toothbrush is amazing! I will definitely recommend this to my friends and family!"
5.00,"My periodontist was a nice guy and all but I never liked it when he said we would be together forever. I'm willing to make that kind of commitment to children and dogs but not a periodontist. After listening to that four times every year, I went looking for my own solutions. I was able to turn around a periodontal problem with two things: the Crest Pro-Health toothpaste series and my perfect special Philips Sonicare(R) FlexCare Rechargeable Sonic Toothbrush. Sadly my favorite Crest pro health morning and night toothpastes have not been readily available in my area so I've been experimenting. The invigorating mint has a good flavor to it. I've put it in the morning slot."
5.00,"The taste is very refreshing, and this toothpaste controls plaque. I have another dental checkup in 6 months. I told my dentist we will have to compare how much plaque build-up I have after using Crest Prohealth Clinical Plaque Control toothpaste to my previous checkups! I'm sure by using this toothpaste it will be much better!"
5.00,"I have tried many toothpaste products over the years. This one is great!!!!!!!!!!! Good taste, works well, good price. The whole family likes it."
5.00,"The toothpaste really gave my teeth that 'just out of the dentist office' feel. I wanted to brush my teeth more than just twice a day!"
5.00,"I enjoyed the mint flavor and after usage my teeth felt like I had just been to a cleaning at the dentist."
5.00,"Really like this toothpaste - leaves my mouth fresh and clean!"
4.00,"Great mouth wash, kills bad breath and you don't smell like alcohol **A+*."
1.00,"I saw this alcohol free mouthwash, with fluoride, and got excited. I purchased it and put it to use. I swished it around my mouth, surprised by the pleasant minty taste. After it was spit out, I was left with a slightly unpleasant aftertaste. An hour later, the flavor worsened and my throat was sore. I craved the chocolate chip cookies that I had baked earlier in the day. I took a bite and the flavor was pure bitterness. I noticed how in the reviews people say they lost flavor. Well, I am jealous because everything I eat with this mouthwash, hours later, tastes like butt. The back of the label warns of discoloration of your teeth and gums. This mouthwash will be going in the garbage."
4.00,"Crest Pro-Health toothpaste was great. It left my mouth feeling fresh longer than other brands I have used in the past. It is a little on the pricey side but the cost is worth the benefits it leaves you with; a fresher mouth and cleaner teeth."
5.00,"This mouthwash did not burn and still felt it made my mouth fresh and clean."
4.00,"While I didn't particularly like the taste, it left my teeth feeling clean and smooth."
5.00,"wake up with fresh clean taste in the morning. I Would buy it for ever if they keep making it."
5.00,"Great mouthwash, made my mouth feel fresh and clean"
5.00,"My husband and I have used the Crest Pro-Health for over a year. We started using this after a couple of not so great dental check-ups. Surprisingly, our last check-ups where excellent! Look Mom, no cavities!!"
5.00,"I so loved this product. My teeth felt so clean! I would so recommend this product to anyone I know!"
4.00,"I loved trying this paste! It tasted good- not too minty like some pastes that I don't care for. Just a clean, refreshing feeling and taste after using!"
4.00,"All of these products worked great and I am glad I had a chance to try them all!"
3.00,"It works like nothing I've ever seen before to keep plaque from forming on your teeth. There really just isn't any plaque build-up when you use this. As far as the burning tissue and loss of taste some people are noticing, I would suggest using it only once a day, in the morning, because you produce a lot less saliva at night to water it down. Also use for only 30 seconds or less, and gently scrape your tongue with a wet toothbrush to remove any foam after rinsing with it. I've been using it for a few months now, and have noticed a LOT of dark stain. I have found the best way to controle this short of a dental cleaning is to put a little baking soda on your finger and rub the stain off. To get stain at the gumline I use a toothpick coated with baking soda. If it were not for the stain I would give it five stars."
5.00,"This is the best tooth past on the market. I love that I get all kinds of coupons for it and that if I buy it when it is on sale I am getting a great deal. My teeth and breath seem fresh and clean all day and at my last check up my dentist told me my teeth looked great! Could not be happier with this product"
1.00,"Not only does this product cause you to lose taste in your mouth, it caused problems with my gums.  The tissue will likely cause weeks to heal!  There is something VERY wrong with this product.  Do not take a chance."
1.00,"After trying this toothpaste, I then tried the regular Crest Pro-Health kind. It gave me the EXACT same problems as this one. I have decided not to try anymore toothpastes by Crest."
5.00,"We just love this toothpaste. It is the only one our household uses and would recommend!"
5.00,"Great product, teeth felt clean and mouth felt refreshed."
5.00,"I like the way my teeth look and feel after using Crest Pro-Health! Best product so far from Crest!"
5.00,"My dentist said my gums were healthier after I started using Crest Clinical toothpaste for gums! It made a great improvement!"
4.00,"This is a great toothpaste if you want clean and a fresh mouth. I think it helps keep my teeth looking white as well."
5.00,"I always buy Crest, because its the best. This is great mouthwash. Good buy. No burn, and its really good for your teeth and gums."
5.00,"Crest is my favorite brand of toothpaste. The whitening plus scope was my favorite until I tried the Clinical Gum Protection! The minty taste was long lasting. Great product!"
5.00,"I loved the new toothpaste. It is exceptional keeping that clean feeling in your mouth. I brush two or three times a day. This product makes me feel fresh all day."
3.00,"Personal care products like mouthwash are subject to intensely \"personal\" feelings about how they taste. What you may find fine to me cold be just terrible, and vice versa.So, that's why I have to say that while this Crest Mouthwash was effective, I don't plan to keep using it. It was certainly effective - no complaints there - but it had a distinctly \"Hydrogen Peroxide-like\" taste to it that made using it unpleasant, and any first drink of coffee afterward quite uninviting.I suppose I've been conditioned too well to expect a \"minty\" taste, so if you're like me, and you don't have any particular need for super strong mouthwash, you probably don't need this.HOWEVER, if you've been given Doctor's orders to keep your mouth quite clean, or have the need to do so for some reason (hiding the fact you're smoking, let's say) this mouthwash will probably be a lot more palatable than actual Hydrogen Peroxide, and with less of the \"bubbling\" factor that HP often leaves in the mouth.Bottom line? If you like a fresh minty taste, this probably isn't for you. If you like strong medicine, give it a try."
4.00,"The product made my teeth feel clean and rid of the daily build up of plaque. Using the toothpaste along with the floss and rinse only added to the benefits of this line."
4.00,"Love the fresh taste! Not sure about the whitening"
4.00,"I have used the Crest Pro-Health Toothpaste and Mouthwash before and enjoyed them so getting both in one package is nice. The only question is when will I ever need both around the same time. Through in a toothbrush I definitely would not need as often as the others even if I did use a manual toothbrush (electric ones are much better if you can afford them). But this package would make a great starter kit if you or someone you know is going off to college or moving into a new place where they would need anything. And though I much prefer my electric, this is the best manual toothbrush I have ever used. And the kit also comes with floss that is nice and thick and cleans in between my teeth better than most floss that I have used in the past."
5.00,"Great taste, fresh and clean, don't have to worry about tartar build up between dental cleanings!"
5.00,"Our son in the US recommended this toothpaste to us as he had started using it. My wife and myself absolutely loved it. She has sensitive teeth anyway and it was great for her and I don't but it didn't seem to be over the top in that area. I would say if you have an allergy for cinnamon like my sister does you would want to stay away from it. I thoroughly enjoyed the taste when I was brushing and the freshness afterwards."
5.00,"wonderful toothpaste-who said that having your teeth shine at a lesser value is a myth-I would recommend this product to anyone"
4.00,"I like it, but I'm not a fan of the taste....guess thats not that important anyway. What matters is that my teeth felt very clean and my breath smelt good =)"
1.00,"While I didn't purchase this product from Amazon, it's so bad that I felt I must warn consumers about this product. It has, to be polite, an awful flavor, but it gets even more disgusting with an aftertaste that lingers for 45 minutes or more after brushing. Both my SO and I, upon using this the first time, were struck by the odd consistency with gravel-like material dispersed throughout. And the taste. And the after-taste. Avoid."
5.00,"The mouthwash left me with fresh breath and was not irritating."
4.00,"I used the Crest Pro Products for one week and noticed a cleaner, brighter smile and my gums arent bleeding when i floss!"
4.00,"First, it was difficult for me to find this product in a local store. Once I tried it though, I really enjoyed it. I felt like it did a great job getting/keeping my teeth clean following a regular cleaning at my dentist."
5.00,"Really like using this after brushing at bedtime and I love that it doesn't have that alcohol harshness"
5.00,"good value, nice taste"
5.00,"I bought this toothpaste 7 months ago and have been using it since and probably will be for as long as they make it.I have gum disease. I found about this product after a visit to the dentist for a deep cleaning session. Since I have been using this my gums have remained pink. The dentist comments now on how well they have been kept between visits.I have seen no film, my mouth doesn't get dry, and I do not have a nasty taste left behind like with other pastes. Another thing, my teeth are way less sensitive. Before use I needed 8 shots to get my teeth cleaned. Now I only need 2. Boom!! I'm a customer for life!"
4.00,"Feels and tastes pretty much like most other toothpastes. It's how you use it! Only time will tell if it improves my dental health."
5.00,"this made my whole mouth feel good. i liked the flavor and how it worked"
4.00,"My breath felt fresh and it helped with my morning breath too."
4.00,"I found this Crest product to be effective as well as refreshing. I will continue to use Crest mouthwash as a regular part of my oral hygiene routine."
2.00,"This toothpate does not have the consistency of a regular paste or gel type toothpaste. It reminds me of a baking soda toothpaste I tried once. The toothpaste mostly seems to \"disolve\" shortly after you start brushing your teeth. Not foamy. I ended up loading the toothbrush twice one for each side of the mouth. Not what I'm used to so it felt strange and I don't think I'll finish the tube. One the plus side it has a nice, mild mint flavor. On the box it says this is for people over 50 which I'm not so maybe that will make a difference in whether you like it or not, but I suspect it doesn't really matter what age you are. You will either like the consistency or not."
3.00,"This product left a funny aftertaste. It did not go away even after about an hour. I had to drink something to get that taste out of my mouth and what it made what I was drinking taste awful. The product did get my teeth clean, but I don't know if it is something that I can live with everyday."
5.00,"I've always been a Colgate Girl, but after using the new Crest, I've been converted. The fresh taste makes my teeth feel cleaner than they ever have."
5.00,"I love Crest Pro Health toothpaste - I feel it gets my teeth cleaner than \"ordinary\" toothpastes. I would definitely recommend it."
4.00,"Have been using the gum protection for a while now. Mouth feels cleaner and fresher especially when I wake up in the morning."
5.00,"Loved the minty freshness that really lasts and saw a noticeable difference in my teeth in less than a week. great for the in between months of the dentist keeping your teeth in tip top shape"
4.00,"I actually use the mouthwash not only for my teeth, but for my mouth guard. It works great, especially for keeping the mouth guard from getting gross when brushing alone doesn't completely clean it."
5.00,"I love this mouthwash. It leaves me feeling refreshed and my teeth feeling healthy. Would never go back to using anything else!"
5.00,"Love this product, I really felt like my entire mouth was benefiting from this mouthwash, I felt protected and clean."
1.00,"This is the worst toothpaste ever! I, like many others have experienced the peeling of my mouth, extremely dry lips, bumps on my lip, sore mouth, etc. I even went so far as to buy a humidifier because I thought it was the dry, cold weather. I have contacted Crest and the FDA regarding these harsh side effects of this toothpaste. This should be pulled off the market immediately! I hate this toothpaste and wish things would clear up quicker."
5.00,"Using this product was great! My mouth was very refreshed. I would definitely recommend this product to everyone. What a fresh feeling!"
5.00,"I always loved and bought crest. I now use the pro-health variety. It works great and taste great. Have already recommended this toothpaste to friends and family."
4.00,"This rinse leaves your mouth feeling fresh and clean without burning."
5.00,"Crest Pro Health Clinical is the most effective mouth wash our family has ever tried. As a diabetic, fresh breath is a daily struggle. With Crest Pro Health we found that innovative product that meets our unique needs. The fresh taste and cleanliness of mouth are unmatched. Diabetic mouth odor is no longer a problem in our house."
4.00,"I am not sure what is going on with these bad reviews. My husband and me buy it at Costco in a 2 pack. We both really like this mouth wash and never had any issues with it. It seems to clean my teeth very well."
3.00,"Maybe the small tube that I tried wasn't enough to really tell, but I did not find this paste exceptional. It got my teeth clean but could not see any difference in whiteness. And the taste was rather bland, not as minty as I would like."
5.00,"I love how it cleans my teeth, and makes it so fresh and clean"
3.00,"I tried the Deep Clean toothpaste. I am one who LOVES the fresh from the dentist feeling and I was very excited to try this product, in hopes that I could have that feeling throughout the day. I was not very impressed with this product. I didn't feel that it was any different than your average toothpaste both right after brushing as well as during the day. I also did not at all like the taste of it. I feel like my mouth did not have a \"fresh\" feeling after using it."
4.00,"I love this, leaves your mouth feeling clean and sparkling!!"
4.00,"Crest Pro-Health Night Clean Mint Mouthwash Rinse was given to me, as a sample, by my dentist, following my last dental appointment. The flavor is mild, and I found it refreshing that it was alcohol free. That meant no burning sensation afterwards. I was sorry to see (from other customer reviews) that others, who had used the product, did not have as positive an experience as I did. I am glad to report that I did not lose feeling in my mouth, nor did my teeth turn brown after the fact. I would gladly use this mouthwash again in the future."
4.00,"Great product. Really kept my teeth feeling clean and smooth!"
4.00,"I have been looking for a clinical mouthwash for sometime now, this product deliver value and quality. I will be using this brand for now on."
5.00,"the crest pro health toothpaste does exactly what it says it can do. the taste is refreshing. my teeth feel clean and brilliantly white as going to the dentist for a cleaning. using the toothpaste in between my regular dentist visit will allow me to keep a healthy clean white smile. i would recommend this product."
4.00,"I appreciate all the features of this toothpaste, but I just didn't care for the way it tastes."
5.00,"My teeth are whiter and feel very clean! I really think this is the best toothpaste out there."
3.00,"Pro-Health made my teeth feel very clean and shiny. Missed the regular toothpaste minty taste. Product is quite expensive also."
4.00,"Made my teeth clean and feeling great. I would recommend the product, but the price is too high."
3.00,"It worked for me like many others with the same properties. It wasn't exceptional above others but it did what it was supposed to do unlike many. My only thing is that using the product line was not like dentist clean so I did not rate it at a 5 star."
4.00,"This really leaves your teeth feeling clean. My favorite is still the 3d white toothpaste, but this one is really great. I would definitely buy again."
3.00,"Crest ProHealth is good at cleaning your teeth but I don't see any difference from using any other Crest toothpaste."
5.00,"I used this and the mouthwash I felt a difference they felt more clean then with the other tooth paste I was using..Great taste too I'm surprised"
4.00,"I had a wonderful feeling after I brushed. It would be interesting to see what type of results I get with long term use."
5.00,"I was having issues in the past with sensitivity near the top of my teeth so I assumed it might be an issue with my enamel. Ever since I have used this toothpaste, I haven't had any issues. This has helped a great deal and don't use any other toothpaste."
4.00,"THE TOOTHPASTE MADE MY TEETH FEEL SMOOTH AND CLEAN. I THINK ITS A GOOD PRODUCT."
4.00,"I liked the feel of my teeth after i used the toothpaste and i have tried the mouthwash and would recomend both!"
5.00,"I really like this product just like most Crest products. The flavor is great & it cleans well."
5.00,"This toothpaste has a fresh taste and really cleans well."
5.00,"Compared to other Crest, pro-health is the best, for me at least.It actually feels like you're teeth are clean after brushing and it feels like their being cleaned while brushing.I was using a Crest gel toothpaste before wasn't doing the best job. This toothpaste is not a gel and it works great for me.Give it a try or 2"
4.00,"I liked this rinse above any others that I have tried before. My mouth didn't feel strange after using it and so far it is working well for me. I love Crest products."
4.00,"My mouth felt cleaner the first time I used it and I saw a difference in less than a week!"
2.00,"This product is very expensive, and doesn't leave me with that \"fresh mouth\" feeling"
5.00,"My teeth felt really clean all day long. Great taste, too!"
4.00,"My teeth felt terrific after I used this product. I am switching to this mouth wash."
3.00,"iI liked it. Teeth felt throughly clean and freshness lasted"
5.00,"I loved it. My mouth and teeth felt very clean after using it."
4.00,"After using the product for about a week, I can say that my teeth definitely feel cleaner. I'm not so fond of the taste, but the product does work well. I would recommend this product."
5.00,"The Crest clincal mouthwash is alcohol free. does not leave a bad taste. Excellent product!"
4.00,"Leaves your mouth feeling nice and fresh! I am never disappointed by Crest products."
4.00,"Yes, like so many other reviewers advise, this product does make the skin inside your mouth peel which is really disgusting and can be embarrassing. However, if you have tooth pain issues, this toothpaste is somewhat of a godsent. It contains Stannous Fluoride which is anti-bacterial. This toothpaste is ADA approved. The flavor always reminds me of a big brand name cola that starts with a P :) I wish the formula would be improved to not include whatever chemical it is that makes your mouth peel. That would make this toothpaste much better. Also, as usual with common brand name toothpastes....WAY too many nasty chemicals. There is no natural brand toothpaste that has Stannous Fluoride in it though. Overall, I think Stannous Fluoride is more effective than regular fluoride. The box states it may cause tooth staining but I have not experience any of that and have been using this for over a year now. I think the key is brushing 2-3 times a day, flossing EVERY night, and using a mouthwash occasionally. I have tried many non-fluoride natural toothpastes (xylitol and calcium glycerophosphate ones, etc.) and even though they always taste much better and are much more gentle on mouth tissues, they do not seem to protect against cavities as well as regular old fluoride toothpastes."
5.00,"i loved it. it was cheep, it worked very good, will tell friends about it."
4.00,"It made my teeth feel so clean and tasted great too."
5.00,"Refreshing taste, great texture and good value! I'm glad I gave it a try!"
1.00,"The reviewer that said they experienced \"no taste\" with this product got off lucky. THIS CRAP TURNED MY TEETH, THE BOTTOM PORTIONS ESPECIALLY, A BROWNISH YELLOW. It has been documented that this product does that to everybody and this should be pulled from the shelves!"
5.00,"I really loved this product. I have sensitive teeth and it didnt bother them at all. The taste was great, it wasn't too strong and my mouth really did feel nice afterwards. I will use this product everyday!"
5.00,"Great taste. Did not burn while swishing. Mouth felt fresh."
5.00,"I thought this toothpaste was awesome! It had a good taste and I felt like my teeth had just been cleaned at the dentist!"
5.00,"I love this product. It makes my mouth feel clean."
5.00,"Love the Crest products. The new mouthwash Prohealth mouthwash it by far one of the best in keeping teeth clean after you brush. My kids use this on a daily basis."
5.00,"I loved the Crest Prohealth line, my teeth feel sweaty clean and I can feel it working!!"
5.00,"Leaves your mouth feeling very fresh and I'd buy this again in a minute."
5.00,"I have been using this mouthwash for over 6 months and it has been great. Of the crest mouthwashes (blue pro health & 3d whitening included), this is my favorite. I use it at night before I go to bed, and in the next day there is no gross morning breath. I have not experienced discoloration of teeth or losing the ability to taste at all. After using this mouthwash, it does make your mouth feel a little dry, but it just takes a little getting used to. They've stopped carrying this product at Target so now I order from Amazon. Totally worth it. I'm just glad I can still get it somewhere!"
5.00,"I love how this makes my teeth feel super smooth and it has just the right amount of mint in the toothpaste."
1.00,"The third time I opened the tube of toothpaste the pop-top cap broke off."
5.00,"i like this product . i will recomend product. thanks"
5.00,"I loved this mouth wash!!!! It made my teeth clean and taste was not bad at all."
5.00,"I think I have found a new toothpaste. I loved how clean my teeth were after using the product."
5.00,"Teeth always feel clean after brushing, almost as good as when you go to the dentist!"
5.00,"The crest toothpaste worked very well on my teeth. My teeth are whiter then they were before I started using the toothpaste."
4.00,"I started using Crest Pro-Health Night about two years ago, and my dental hygienist noticed an improvement in tartar control and general dental health. I had been using a cinnamon toothpaste that I finally connected to recurring canker sores, and Pro-Health Night solved that as well. But apparently people considered a \"Night\" formulation to be something of a scam, and sales were poor. They discontinued it, which is too bad, since it was my favorite toothpaste. On the positive side, Amazon had a link to a reseller who was selling packs of five, so I'll have enough of this for another year or two, provided my wife and son continue to use their own brands."
1.00,"I picked up this Crest Pro Health Mouth Rinse at Sam's Club- was out of my regular mouthwash &amp; figured I'd try this (and that the flouride might be a nice addition)-- WRONG. I used the rinse twice daily and was not immediately aware of a loss of taste sensation, but within 2 weeks had lost my sensation of sweetness for the first time in my life. Kind of suspected the Pro-Health as this was the only change in my routine. I am in good health otherwise. Continued using for about 2 more weeks and sense of taste worsened so all food tasted bland/different. Just started researching on the web and see numerous others with same problem. Will stop using immediately and hope normal taste will resume soon (I read that taste buds are replaced about every ten days). Perhaps only a small peercentage of users experience this problem, but I sure did. BEWARE!!!! (Crest should provide a warning on the label!)"
5.00,"I also like the different flavors they offer. And that makes my grandkids brush a little longer."
5.00,"used the toothpaste and was impressed with the lasting clean"
1.00,"I recently decided to give this toothpaste a try.  I wish I had done research first, but it is just toothpaste.  My tongue is swollen, my mouth is dried out, my tastebuds are inflamed and protruding out of the sides of my tongue. Also, I can hardly taste, and it is somewhat painful to eat.  I contacted the company; I was told that these symptoms are, in fact, a reaction to the toothpaste.  Upon doing further reasearch, I found that there are other Crest products that have been causing these severe reactions.  I will be switching to a natural toothpaste."
5.00,"Great product! I love the way my teeth feel so clean and fresh. This mouthwash does not burn like others I have tried in the past. I use it before I go to bed and my teeth have never been happier!"
5.00,"I liked this toothpaste a lot. I felt my teeth were very clean and that it kept plaque away."
4.00,"I wasn't quite sure what to expect when I picked up this product. I have to admit - I was pleasantly surprised. It was better than expected - good taste, consistency, and left my teeth feeling cleaner. Definitely worth a try!"
1.00,"I got this with the free mouthwash and have been using it for a few weeks. The gritty feel is weird but it is the aftertaste that I hate. It seems to hang around for hours after you brush. I would never buy this again."
5.00,"From the moment I tried this product I loved it! My teeth felt super clean and my mouth refreshed. Great feeling!"
5.00,"The toothpaste works great.....had clean teeth and a fresh breath for a good while."
4.00,"The toothpaste was very cleansing, left a wonderful taste in my mouth and 'lathered' up nicely as it cleaned. The toothbrush easily 'wrapped' around my teeth and even though I used floss, I feel that my gum line and in between my teeth were cleaner than using my normal brand. I enjoyed using both of these products together as well."
5.00,"My teeth felt so clean. It was just like coming home after a cleaning from the dentist. I highly recommend!"
5.00,"I've been using this product for two months and it works great for me. I have damange to my enamel from three years of braces and an allergic reaction to the adhesive. This product has helped to fortify what enamel I have left. I have extremely sensitive skin and really weird allergies to obscure ingredients, but have had no problem with this product. No burning, no numbness, no weird taste. I like it."
5.00,"This toothpaste left my teeth and breath feeling fresh and clean. A++++"
5.00,"made my mouth feel fresh and clean and it was worth the price"
1.00,"I first started using this product after I had some dental work. I could not deal with the burn of regular alcohol since I had my gums cut into. It did not burn at all and made my teeth white from the peroxide, but every time I used it, I would spit out a slimy substance. I figured it was plaque or something similar. After about four days of using it twice a day, I noticed my tongue was slightly numb and it felt as if I had burnt it on hot food. I used the mouthwash again after my tongue started hurting and it stung very bad (This being a mouthwash that doesn't burn) To make it worse, I can hardly taste any food. It does not matter how strong or salty it is. It has now been three days since I stopped using this terrible product and my mouth no longer hurts, but my taste is still gone. I hope it comes back soon. This product is the equivalent of getting a chemical peel done in your mouth. It should be removed from the market. I contacted Crest about this, but assume it will fall on deaf ears."
5.00,"Loved the flavor. My teeth and mouth felt very refreshed afterwards and my teeth were whiter."
5.00,"I really like how clean my mouth and teeth felt after using this. I would definitely buy it again. The taste was great, too! It wasn't too strong making it unpleasant."
5.00,"I loved the Crest Pro Health Plaque control tooth paste. My teeth felt so clean (clean as in going to the dentist) and my mouth felt minty for a few hours after I used it! Crest has always been my favorite toothpaste, but this is the best by far!! Thank you!"
5.00,"I'll buy this toothpaste again!"
4.00,"I've been a long time user of another brand of mouth rinse. I tried the Crest Pro-health and was pleased with my experience. I didn't experience the \"burn\" that was always associated with the other product, but my mouth still felt fresh and clean. I recommend this to others who don't necessarily like the burn of other mouth rinses, but want that clean feeling."
5.00,"This product gave you that squeaky clean feeling. It left my teeth clean and my breath fresh. Thanks Vocalpoint"
5.00,"I have been using Crest toothpaste and mouthwash for years. This is the first time I tried their floss. It is a great product. I glides smoothly and doesn't get stuck between my teeth as much as many of the other brands. I am very happy with their products."
5.00,"I am one of the few people that loves going to the dentist. I love how my teeth feel after a cleaning. Well now I don't have to make a trip to the dentist to have that squeaky clean feeling. I can just use the toothpaste. It's great."
4.00,"I like this mouthwash. I'm not a big fan of most mouth washes, but this one I liked. I feel like it helped clean the areas I miss with brushing (top of the mouth, back of the tongue, etc.). I'd buy it again. Much less harsh feeling than Listerine."
3.00,"I prefer a stronger rinse/wash. I really couldn't tell that something had been used."
1.00,"After eating an Altoid the other day and noticing that I couldn't taste it, I realized that something was not right. I've been using this mouth wash for about a week now and have the same symptoms that everyone else is talking about - a burning tongue and loss of taste. Who the hell tests this stuff before putting it on the market???"
1.00,"This product stained my teeth so badly that my dentist and orthodontist both asked me if I'd taken up smoking. When I changed to a Listerine rinse (honestly, I don't even know which kind) my teeth went back to pearly white. I absolutely anti-recommend this product, and don't understand why in its current formulation it remains on the market."
1.00,"I am a young healthy person. I don't have adverse reactions to products. I've never had an issue with a dental product. I decided to try using this for a change and because it contains no ETOH. Immediate discomfort, numbness, loss of sensation and taste. The active ingredient is CPC. Look up toxicology the stuff is very bad for you and has caused birth defects in test animal populations. I am scared after reading many reviews including reports of trips to the emergency room. I called the number on the bottle. They said they'd had reports of complaints but were awfully cavalier and said to rinse with salt water. Too bad that's not going to help the pain deep in my jaw. These people should be sued. Please don't buy this. CPC also wipes out the normal microbiota in your mouth not just plaque forming bacteria. That can put you at risk for secondary infections and serious I problems !!!!"
3.00,"I really tried to like the rinse and for the most part I did, but I also found that it left a film in my mouth that was unpleasant. Did anyone else expience this? It was certainly easy to use, a great taste, smell, so I'd recommend it."
5.00,"I really like that I get a clean almost professional feel after I use the toothpaste. Great quality and fresh breath for a long time."
4.00,"Very good, taste wasn't too strong and has helped my teeth; especially when I wake up in the morning!"
5.00,"After brushing my teeth for the first time using this product my teeth automatically felt cleaner for longer. Great Product."
5.00,"The new Crest left my teeth feeling clean as though I had just had a cleaning at my dentist. Every day is like a dental cleaning. I love the way my mouth feels so clean my teeth feel slick."
4.00,"I really liked it because it made my teeth feel very clean."
5.00,"After using this product, my teeth feel amazing and they look so much better too!"
1.00,"Warning!!!! Don't buy this toothpaste - I have NEVER had any problems with  toothpaste until I started using the Crest Pro-Health.  It caused the skin inside my mouth to peel after I brush my teeth - big stringy globs of skin - this can't be good for my mouth  - isn't mouth cancer caused by constant irritation of the tissue?  There should be a lawsuit against this company - it's probably made in China and we all know how famous China is for it's poisonous products.  I'm going back to using Biotene."
5.00,"The entire family really likes the Crest ProHealth line of toothpastes. We are partial to the Night formula. It is not too minty, makes your teeth and mouth feel really clean and handles sensitivity issues well."
5.00,"Gosh, I read so many negative reviews that I almost didn't try this toothpaste for gingivitis. Then, I thought, why not try it? I have switched to a very soft toothbrush as recommended and only used for about a minute. I'm also using a rinse prescribed by dentist. So, I brushed last night, and gums seemed to feel better. Brushed this morning, same thing. I will continue using until I have a negative effect and if it is helping me. It is not the best tasting toothpaste in the world, but that is not why i bought it. Also, so far, no slime, sores, etc. as written by some. I just raised from 4 stars to 5 stars after using it longer. My gums feel and look so much better. I am so happy with this toothpaste. I have not even been using the dentist prescribed rinse."
3.00,"I love the Crest Brand, but I will stick with my Crest Whitening with Scope. It seems to work just as well and the taste is better."
5.00,"My teeth felt really clean after brushing with this tooth paste. Loved it!"
4.00,"We used the product and it gave me piece of mind that they willing chose to use it. We like the crest brand and haven't been disappointed yet."
5.00,"I think all of the Crest products are great. After using the Pro-Health plaque control, my teeth felt cleaner and smoother! Just like right after a cleaning at the dentist's office! The minty flavoring is not over-powering but the freshness lasts a long time."
5.00,"This toothpaste is very refreshing and makes your teeth feel very clean."
5.00,"It's all we'll stock in the med cabinet. It's remains the brand name we've always used and trusted."
4.00,"Teeth felt fresh and clean. The taste wasn't to strong like some toothpaste. Will buy again."
4.00,"The Crest mouthwash leaves my mouth and breathe feeling refreshed. It does not burn."
4.00,"Toothpaste made my teeth feel nice and clean. Pricey toothpaste,but I like the feel of my teeth after brushing."
5.00,"Great mouthwash. It was a little strong but left my teeth feeling very clean."
5.00,"I've been using this product for a while, and I love the clean feeling I get every time I brush.  I've also noticed my teeth are whiter since starting to use this.  The cinnamon flavor is great.  Never saw a product before that has the ADA seal for gingivitis, whitening, and sensitivity together.  This is the only toothpaste I use now."
4.00,"Definitely one step above from regular Crest, Colgate, Aquafresh, etc. It really works on your tongue and leave satisfying feeling."
5.00,"I tried the Pro Health Clinical Plaque Control Toothpaste. It really leaves your teeth feeling super clean ! I Loved it!"
4.00,"I loved sampling this product and will be sure to purchase it in the future."
5.00,"I only use Crest as it's so refreshing in the mouth but most of all it does a good job on the teeth"
5.00,"I liked having a fresh minty mouth without the burn of alcohol! My whole mouth felt clean"
1.00,"I have been using this toothpaste for almost 3 weeks now and I just realized that Satan invented it. At first I couldn't understand why my gums hated me so much and then one day it hit me......THE TOOTHPASTE. This wretched product has caused me so much pain in the past week. The bottom of my tongue hurts so bad that I no longer have the pleasure of picking food out of my teeth for leftovers. Even with the softest tooth brush my gums still kill. If I could rate this in negative stars I would but Amazon won't allow me that much. But this is only the half of it though...... Because I have used this toothpaste I have now acquired Leprosy, Chicken Pox and Athletes Foot altogether in one big party of pain. I hope your happy Crest. Do not use this product!!!!!!!!!"
5.00,"This is a great toothpaste and I was very pleased with the results!"
5.00,"I was excited to buy this toothpaste because I have been worried about plaque buildup. The first time I used this product I wasn't entirely certain how I felt about it but, after repeated use, I know it works. I will definitely buy this product again."
5.00,"I LOVED this toothpast it had a nice minty flavor that left my mouth feeling nice and clean. It is not a bad value for your money either!!!"
5.00,"Crest 3D works great. I used to use whitening strips now my teeth are white all the time just from brushing."
4.00,"I love the Crest mouthwash. It leaves my mouth and teeth feeling extra clean and my breath smells minty fresh!"
5.00,"The new Pro-Health Clinical toothpaste worked great on my teeth and was very fresh and minty. I loved this product and I will be buying more of it."
5.00,"I had been complaining about my teeth not feeling as clean as they could so I thought I'd try this toothpaste. It works great. A great CLEAN feeling now!"
5.00,"Will continue to buy this for the entire family."
4.00,"Love the Crest Clinical products. The toothpaste is a little expensive but reasonable with a sale or coupon. I will continue to purchase this one since I take great care of my teeth."
5.00,"My whole family really liked this mouth rinse we will continue to use this product."
5.00,"I like the flavor of this mouthwash, and it doesn't burn like some other brands. It leaves my mouth feeling clean and fresh."
4.00,"it works well just a little on the pricy side. It keeps my mouth fresh a lot longer then other brands"
5.00,"I like the way this made my mouth feel clean and fresh."
5.00,"i really like this product. i have bad breath and it really help with my breath. it made my mouth feel really clean and fresh."
4.00,"I recently went to the dentist after a few years hiatus and was pleased to find no tooth or gum problems. I attribute much of this to using good toothpaste, and Crest has made a great one with their pro-health plaque protector! Thanks for the great product!"
2.00,"I'm probably used to toothpastes foaming and feeling like its getting in between my teeth as I brush, but this toothpaste did not. I never felt like I had enough on the brush to clean my teeth adequately. I won't be continuing to use this particular toothpaste."
5.00,"I love the Crest toothpaste. Everyone in my family loves the taste and the clean feeling that you are left with."
5.00,"I absolutely loved the taste of this toothpaste. It left your mouth feeling fresh and very clean. I am an avid believer that the better toothpaste you buy; the better protection you will get. I also love the way it leaves your breath smelling."
5.00,"I have to say that this is one of the top toothpastes I've tried in a while. My teeth felt cleaner and that feeling stayed longer than the 5 minutes that other toothpastes last. Even my husband commented on it being a good toothpaste and he didn't know that I'd be reviewing it. (He usually only tells me if he hates/dislikes something.)"
5.00,"I really like the Pro-Health products; they do what they say they'll do. Crest Pro-Health Clinical toothpaste not only cleans my teeth, but also leaves my mouth feeling fresh. It's great to know that this toothpaste helps control plaque and keeps my gums healthy. I've noticed a difference in how my teeth look and feel since using Pro-Health, and I'd highly recommend it to anyone."
5.00,"This is some of the most awesome mouthwash ever!!! My whole family loved it. It keeps your mouth fresh for awhile. We have definitely found a new mouthwash!!!"
1.00,"More of this toothpaste gets wasted oozing out onto the counter, the packaging cannot seem to control the product oozing out into the drawer, onto the counter, etc. What a messy, messy, oozy mess of a product. I am disgusted every time I clean my counter tops."
5.00,"Has a good taste and makes my mouth feel extra fresh."
5.00,"I have noticed a big difference in the whitening of my family's teeth. My oldest son is a teenager and his smile is a big deal to him. I bought this product because I hoped it would be a safe way to brighten his smile and it has. Thank you!!!"
5.00,"This product really helps clean your teeth. It doesn't burn and it tastes good. I am very impressed and will continue to use!"
5.00,"Crest has always been my favorite toothpaste and the only brand I buy. I usually buy the kind with Scope but now think I may stick with Pro Health moving forward. It left my mouth tingly and refreshed but not burning. It felt clean and healthy. What more can you ask from a toothpaste?"
4.00,"I'm not sure I can tell the difference between all these different mouth wash products. I really wanted it to be different. Also, why aren't these products approved by the American Dental Association?"
5.00,"The taste was great and it does a good job. I would recommend this to everyone."
4.00,"For the longest time in my adult life I avoided Crest toothpaste because I remembered that literally pasty consistency that just felt gross in my mouth. My product of choice for years and years was Colgate, but when I started using the I developed extreme sensitivity to cold and heat. This became a problem, not just while brushing, but when eating and drinking as well. As my husband preferred it anyway, we switched to Crest. My husband has been using the but had been leery of trying a whitening paste again because of the potential sensitivity issue. When I made the switch, however, I was happy to discover that not only has the old pasty paste been changed to a more gel-like formula, but I haven't had any problems with tooth or gum sensitivity. I actually prefer the consistency of this paste to any other. It's gel-like but with \"crystals\" in it that provide some friction while brushing. The minty flavor is rather light, and my teeth and gums feel really clean after brushing. I can't honestly say that my teeth are getting any whiter, but they do seem like they are shinier. That might be the fact that I'm paying more attention to my brushing, or it might actually be a change in my teeth, who knows. In any case, I'm sticking with the Pro-Health line of dental products. I like the variety that allows me to switch it up once in a while but that also gives me consistency. And while I haven't noticed a dramatic change in whiteness, my husband has started using the and the difference is visible and dramatic!"
4.00,"Overall, I will buy this brand and type again."
1.00,"tears up the inside of my mouth. I find myself brushing faster just to get it out because it strips off all the layers of skin in my mouth and gives me sores if I leave it in there too long. though the company may claim that it's good to get rid of dead layers of skin and it's just super powerful antibacterial stuff, I actually find myself having yuckier breath in the morning... besides, I can get a nice clean mouth without the mouth pain and dead skin that I get with this sucky product."
5.00,"Crest complete gets my teeth clean and removes surface stains. It also has a great taste."
5.00,"This is an excellent product. I use it daily and can already see a different in how clean my teeth feel."
5.00,"This one single tooth paste is great for whitening, breath freshener and sensitive teeth. It's also got great cleaning power, which is what toothpast is for. I highly recommend it."
5.00,"This product works great! I was afraid it might burn as some products do but I am happy to report there was no burn. The taste was wonderful and my mouth felt clean and fresh for hours. Great product!"
5.00,"Love the way it make my teeth feel. I been use it every day."
4.00,"The toothpaste in this line is great. It has nice minty taste. I likethat the container can stand on its own and is easy to dispense. I really feel that it is helping to make my teeth stronger. They definately feel cleaner after I brush. Cant wait to see how my next dental appt goes."
4.00,"I purchased the Crest pro health sensitive toothpaste. I would highly recommend using it for sensitive teeth. I normally only use sensodyne but since trying this I am happy to say I will be switching from my normal toothpaste not only does it help but also makes your teeth feel cleaner."
1.00,"I started using this product a few weeks ago and immediately started experiencing pain and numbness on my tongue. It has severely limited my taste of food and beverages. I was hoping it would go away but it still has not. I don't understand how such a product could reach the shelves with such damaging effects. I would recommend Crest recall this product, and I will definitely be submitting a report to the FDA."
5.00,"Tried a sample and went for my 6 mos dental check up...no cavities and they said I was taking excellent care of my teeth! Am going to try the whole line! thanks!"
5.00,"we're used to that bite of alchol in our mouth wash.. Not here with this and it really does make your mouth feel fresher longer. Not so sure how it would work after you just ate Limburger cheese, onions on dirk rye however. :)"
5.00,"Crest Pro Health toothpaste is an excellent product!"
5.00,"I love how it makes your teeth feel so clean and refresh, The taste was mild but still left your teeth and mouth feeling clean. The only thing that I did not like about it was the price. It is so expensive. I wish that it was cheaper, but I will still buy it."
5.00,"I have been a big Crest fan for many years, the new Crest Pro-Health Clinical toothpaste did not disappoint! It has a really good taste and it makes my teeth feel super-clean and even shiney!!"
5.00,"I love my coffee and tea and the whitening toothpaste helps keep my teeth pretty."
5.00,"Crest ProHealth toothpaste is the best I have ever tried. My teeth and mouth feel so clean and fresh for a long time. This is my favorite toothpaste and I will be using it for a very long time."
5.00,"i was worried about the SLS in this. its doesnt irritate my mouth. it whitens better than sensodyne. cons: you can see my fillings now."
4.00,"I liked the tooth paste and my teeth felt clean. I thought it worked well. I do however feel its a little pricy."
3.00,"So far, I notice nothing fabulous about this toothpaste. It's just toothpaste, with a mild taste that is not quite what I look for in toothpaste. I prefer kind of a mint explosion, especially after eating sharply flavored food. I guess I'm just looking for something with a little more punch to it. I haven't yet finished the tube, and I have to admit that this is not a particular product that I look forward to using -- I've already switched off to the \"regular\" tube of Crest that's sitting on the shelf."
1.00,"I would not but this product again. While it does clean your teeth. It does not taste good at all. Makes me want to rush through the process -- and that is not the point of brushing your teeth."
1.00,"I recently started using this mouthwash and just yesterday I noticed that something was staining my teeth brown. I wasn't sure if it was something that I was eating or drinking. So I started going back and trying to think of everything that I had been eating and drinking in the past couple of weeks. Nothing was out of the ordinary. Then I realized that the only thing different going in my mouth had been my mouthwash. And sure enough, when I looked up reviews for this product, there were hundreds of complaints. I found a number to call to make a complaint on another customer's review. The phone number is 1-800-285-9139. I urge anyone who has had this same issue (or the loss of taste issue) to call them. You actually get to talk to a person. I spoke with someone who is supposedly mailing me a refund check. He told me that this is an issue which only affects a small number of people, which I know to be not true. He assured me that the stains will come out. I really hope they do."
5.00,"What a difference having the right toothpaste! My dentist is also very happy with this formula. My teeth are whiter and there is very little, if any, plaque build up."
5.00,"Crest is a good thooth paste. sometimes I have a chance to buy stuffs through the net so why not ordering along products that we will use in a daily basis."
4.00,"i liked the way it tasted not yucky like some of the other ones n when this product is on sale i will buy it again!!"
1.00,"After using this product 8 times, my tongue felt as if I had severe chemical burns. Food tastes terrible and it is very painful. It has also given me canker-like sores on my upper gums and my gumline is painful and bleeding. I did some research and found many people with the exact symptoms as mine from this product. I called the 1(800)# for Crest to report my symptoms and they offered to send me a gift card for $5.95. Oh boy, thanks! How about my dentist bills, and the fact that i cant sleep or eat from the pain? They then transfered me to a \" medical professional\" who advised that I stop using it immediately because I am having a \"rare and uncommon\" allergic reaction. Really? Hundreds and hundreds of reviews and complaints online, and this reaction is considered uncommon? They should be ashamed."
5.00,"I love this Pro Health Crest toothpaste. It leaves my mouth feeling nice and clean with a noticeable fresh breath. I think many will love the minty taste too. Yes, I'd definitely recommend."
5.00,"I have sensitive teeth and the toothpaste helps a lot. It also keeps them feeling clean. High quality and a brand you can trust."
5.00,"My teeth feel so squeaky clean. i am loving this toothpaste!"
4.00,"I liked this product. My family already has favorites toothpastes, so probably won't buy again."
5.00,"I am not usually spending much, if any, time thinking about toothpastes. That being said, this is a surprisingly good variation on the Crest Pro Health line. It really keeps my mouth clean overnight! And it has fresher taste than most I have tried, not like candy, or fake mint, but more like wintergreen berries. And it rinses cleanly out of both the toothbrush and your mouth. Too many toothpastes are like gum these days, or worse, like library paste. But it must have been a fad...it is not readily available anywhere any longer."
4.00,"The product cleaned my teeth and left me with the \"back from the dentist\" feeling after a weeks use."
1.00,"It would be really awesome to know prior to buying this product that it causes 'temporary loss of taste.' I'm quoting from the crest website after I submitted a complaint. I have a story similar to most everyone. I don't have gum disease but wanted to be preventive because I have crowns and know how important dental hygiene is with any dental work. I've used it for a little over a week and only in the evening. I did notice the slime residue after spitting. I usually ended up spitting again a minute or two later. I don't remember any buring when I began using the product but now it does burn. After using my tounge is numb and my entire mouth throbs. I noticed my loss of taste about four days ago when I tried to eat a peppermint lifesaver and I could only feel the texture and taste nothing. I really hope things begin to tast normal again soon. I've read the other reviews and some people say it takes a month. :( I did a little more research on the active ingredient.... turns out it's in some household cleaners and insecticides. I also ready something about it is only intended for short term use...less than 7 days."
5.00,"Really like this toothpaste not overpowering on taste yet my teeth felt really clean."
5.00,"This was my first time trying this Crest Pro-Health toothpaste, & I really like the results. It has a great minty taste, that left my teeth feeling super clean, & my breath feeling fresh. It felt like I had just returned from the dentist after having my teeth cleaned!"
1.00,"This is the only product I've ever bought for which I felt the need to write a review on Amazon. At first, I really enjoyed this mouthwash, because it seemed so potent. Like many of the other reviewers, it did seem to dull my tastebuds, but I didn't mind terribly because it made my fresh breath last for a long time. However, after consistent use I started to notice the brown stains. It almost looked as if I had big spaces between my teeth because the stains were so dark. I couldn't figure out why it was happening, but after reading reviews on Amazon I realized it was probably because of the mouthwash! I went to the dentist this morning for a cleaning and the hygenist told me she's never seen staining that bad on my teeth. Besides the staining, she also said I had a ton of plaque and tartar buildup, so the mouthwash doesn't even do an adequate cleaning job! Needless to say I will never use this mouthwash again. Stay away."
4.00,"My kids and I really liked this toothpaste. It left my mouth fresh and clean. The toothpaste was a little expensive."
1.00,"I originally purchased Crest Clinical mouth mouth six weeks ago, just after getting my teeth professionally cleaned. I initially really liked the foaming action and the clean feeling it left in my mouth after use. After using the first bottle I purchased a second bottle, which my wife and I shared. After less than six weeks of use, I noticed that I was getting a lot of brown staining between my teeth, which I have never had in 50 years of owning my teeth. When I contact Crest regarding the unsightly staining, they told me that a small percentage of users will get brown staining which is cause by the dead bacteria building up on your teeth (yes very appealing). I cannot imagine why any product which claims to whiten teach, but can cause such staining is still on the market. They apologized and are sending a refund for my purchase. I am asking them to pay to have my teach professionally cleaned because I cannot get the stains off myself. I have been using Crest products my whole life and have never had problems like this. My wife stopped using the product because it took away her sense of taste. After a few days of discontinuing use, her taste returned. So to summarize: brown teeth stains and a loss of taste. Stay far away."
5.00,"My teeth felt really clean with this toothpaste!! Great Product!!"
5.00,"I just bought a new batch and was shocked to read all the negative comments about teeth turning brown?  I have no issues......does it make sense that Crest probably the biggest name in toothpaste and dental care would have this product on virtually every grocery store and drug store shelf in the USA and it turns your teeth brown?  Something smells here.  Maybe an odd comment here and there but all those nasty comments from on of the top selling products in the marketplace just doesn't add up. I am very happy with the product as are the members of may family."
4.00,"My teeth feel clean after use. I would recommend this to all my friends."
5.00,"Covers all the bases! Feel like my teeth are cleaner than with other pastes."
3.00,"It was a little pricey for what you get. It had an off after taste."
5.00,"I love Crest Pro-Health toothpaste. It's my toothpaste of choice. I really like the taste compared to other brands and how clean it makes my mouth feel. I really like the Clean Mint flavor too. It's a good all-around toothpaste and I feel confident it's taking care of my teeth and making my breath fresh at the same time."
5.00,"I would use this product on a regular basis. I was left with a clean fresh feeling and liked the taste as well."
5.00,"I haven't used this product long enough to be authoritative, and I haven't been to the dentist yet to confirm improvement in my gum health. BUT...it tastes great and my teeth \"feel clean\"."
3.00,"my family and i used this. we agreed that it has a weird after taste, but once that goes away, it does leave our mouths feeling fresh! we would buy it again."
3.00,"It left my teeth feeling really clean.I love it!!!"
4.00,"it feels like it is still working in your mouth after you brush your teeth."
5.00,"I really enjoying using this product. It leaves my teeth feeling so smooth and clean - and it lasts! Great to feel like I have just seen the dental hygienist every day."
5.00,"I love the pro health line of oral care... my daughter as well uses them and she likes them more then the kids brands"
5.00,"I have been using this product for a couple of years after my Dentist recommended it. I'll use it as long as they keep offering it. Geo."
4.00,"I really liked the new Crest Clinical Plague Control toothpaste. It left my teeth feeling really clean and I saw a noticeable reduction in plague."
4.00,"This is another wonderful product with great features and ones that really work."
2.00,"I love this toothpaste but as others have said...the flip cap does not easily snap shut and you end up with toothpaste oozing out. I understand you can try not to use the flip top and instead screw off the top but come on...how about making the toothpaste a little thicker or redesigning the flip top!? I have several tubes of this toothpaste and will use them but can't see buying it again."
3.00,"crest pro-health is an ok toothpaste, it has a nice minty taste and leaves my mouth feeling fresh and clean, equally to other brands/varieties that I also use."
5.00,"Using Crest Clinical toothpaste leaves a much fresher feeling than the regular Crest that I used to use."
4.00,"got a free sample in the mail. i like it so far. been using it all week. tastes good, no burn, does not dry mouth, seems to whiten teeth. one weird thing is when i spit it out there are blue chunks? don't know what is up with that....my sample came with a $2 off coupon, and its on sale for 2.97 right now. i'll get a full size for only 97 cents..awesome!"
5.00,"I have used the Crest pro-health mouthwash for a long time in the blue color. This flavor was new to me but seemed to work better than the blue. This may be my new fav!"
5.00,"I was loyal to another brand of toothpaste for years...until I got to try this product! I absolutely love that it is professional dental care and the results are truly professional as well. I would definitely recommend this to all my friends and family. I'm really glad I had an opportunity to try this."
5.00,"OK, so I admit, I didn't take very good care of my teeth until I met my girlfriend. She has such great pearly whites I felt it was time to shape up. Well, when I went to floss and brush with a new tooth brush, it was a horror show! There were bleeding gums everywhere. My gums were stinging all the time. I tried brushing after that with my regular brand of toothpaste, but my gums kept bleeding. So, after three weeks of that, I tried Crest Pro-Health Gum Protection. I brushed the first night and, sure enough, there was blood. I expected that. Howerver, I realized that my gums felt better and cleaner after that. The next morning, I brushed again with the Crest...and I couldn't believe my eyes! There...was...NO...BLOOD! None whatsoever! This stuff worked in one application! That second night I flossed and brushed and again no blood and my gums were all pink and healthy looking. This is now the only toothpaste I will use, hands down! I am so thrilled with the fact that Crest delivered what it promised and then some."
5.00,"I love the taste and texture of this toothpaste! It even seems to work like anti-sensitivity toothpaste."
5.00,"This is great toothpaste. I'm a Crest girl all the way and always will be but this is seriously great toothpaste. It really keeps your mouth feeling clean all day long!"
5.00,"Mouthwash is great, and leaves my mouth feeling fresh!"
4.00,"My mouth feels very clean after using this toothpaste."
5.00,"I absolutely loved Crest ProHealthClinical Plaque Control Toothpaste"
5.00,"This toothpaste really helped whiten my teeth and kept them feeling clean."
5.00,"I feel my gums are refreshed. The extra benefit is that I seem to bite my lip occasionally and this helped a lot."
5.00,"This is now my favorite toothpaste! I love how clean and fresh my teeth and mouth feel!!"
5.00,"i like how easy it is to use this product, and to knowing it's good for my teeth, makes me feel good! thanks crest!"
1.00,"I bought this mouthwash 4 days ago, and have been perfectly following the directions - 20ml rinsed for 30 seconds twice a day. Like others I thought the burning sensation on my tongue was from burning my tongue on something. Well today my whole tongue is tingling and I can't taste anything. I sure hope there is no permanent damage to my taste, because this is pretty awful. Moral of the story is this waste of $5 mouthwash is going straight down my drain. Thanks for nothing Crest!"
3.00,"I bought a 7.8 tube of Crest po.health enamel shield. When I laid it down and went to use it the next day,it was oozing out all over. It would not stand upright and the slightest use caused it to leak out. The toothpaste is fine but I feel I lost over half of the toothpaste from it oozing out continually. Just put a screw on cap and it would be much better."
5.00,"Very good, fresh toothpaste that will keep your teeth clean. The price point and value makes it a very good buy."
5.00,"I love the fact that I was not in pain when using this mouthwash! It was terrific!"
4.00,"I loved this product. It made my teeth feel clean for a long time."
4.00,"I really enjoyed this product, it tasted fresh and left my mouth feeling clean and without a film. As the day went on, even after eating and drinking, my mouth still felt fresh. After using Crest Pro-health for several days, my mouth feels better and more healthy than it has in a long time."
5.00,"I hate plaque and love the way my mouth feels after brushing. And I have noticed that my teeth stay clean longer."
5.00,"I loved the mouth wash. It doesn't burn the way other washes do. Left me feeling clean and fresh."
4.00,"Crest seems to have several very similar (possibly identical) products with different names. I've been using what I believe is an identical product with slightly different labeling, Crest Pro-Health Sensitive Plus Enamel Shield Mint Toothpaste for quite awhile (along with other Crest products) at my dental hygienist's suggestion. As an older person, I have the occasional exposed root, which can get pretty sensitive & this does seem to have helped. My only complaint is the taste/consistency isn't quite as pleasant as other Crest varieties. Again, due to the labeling (active ingredient is identical in the 2), look & flavor I do believe this \"For Life Selected For Ages 50+\" formulation is 100% identical to the \"Sensitive + Enamel Shield\". The back labels are also completely identical on the 2 products."
5.00,"Crest Prohealth is an excellent product. It does a thorough job of cleaning my teeth and makes my mouth feel fresh. It is also good for my gums. I have gingivitis and I have seen a noticable improvement in my mouth."
2.00,"Carolyn"
5.00,"I love the product , i feel my teeth polished and so clean from plague"
4.00,"Pleasant and clean feeling. Not too minty or strong."
5.00,"Love that it's alcohol free and still left my teeth feeling so clean! I'll definitely be buying this again!!"
4.00,"I liked this paste....it left my teeth feeling very clean and my breath fresh and happy."
4.00,"After brushing with Plaque Control, my teeth felt smooth and clean. The feeling lasted for hours. For me, the results I get after brushing with this toothpaste are worth spending a little more."
1.00,"This is the worst mouthwash I have ever used. This mouthwash does not have any noticeable antibacterial effect, and it actually makes my breath worse. Honest to goodness, it dries my mouth out and gives me the most awful dragon breath. The side effects of this product outweigh its benefits. There are plenty of decent mouthwashes on the market, stay away from this one."
5.00,"I often switch off between this product and the regular Crest toothpaste, but always stay with the Crest brand. I grew up brushing my teeth with Crest and am amazed at how much progress it has made over the years with oral hygiene and dental care. I highly recommend this brand and it will save you unnecessary trips to see the dentist too."
1.00,"When I first started using Crest Pro-Health Complete with fluoride, I loved that it didn't have the harsh taste of the other fluoride mouth washes I had tried. After using the product twice a day for about a week, my tongue started tingling intensely, and I lost almost all sense of taste. I checked with my physician, who asked if I had any facial drooping or weakness on one side of the body, which I had not. I stopped using the product and my ability to taste was almost back to normal in about 10 days. It's amazing to see so many people are reporting a similar experience in online reviews.I read on one site that people on low or no salt diets (I am on a low salt diet) may be advised against using fluoride topical rinses; but, I think it was talking about the type prescribed by a dentist, and there is no warning about this on the Crest Pro-Health Complete bottle. I also read that some people may have an allergic response to sodium fluoride and fluoride topical rinses. I've used several other fluoride mouth washes without any problems.You may report side effects to the FDA online at[...]"
5.00,"I am not a big mouth wash person but this stuff is great. I really like that there is no burning sensation that you can get with other brands of mouthwash. Leaves your mouth really feeling clean with a great taste as well. I found that it also reduced the morning yuck that you feel in your mouth when you wake up in the morning. Love this stuff!"
5.00,"I loved this mouthwash. It left a clean fresh feeling in my mouth. I will be using this from now on."
1.00,"I started using this product around when I had to go to the dentist for some fillings and initially thought that maybe it was the shots that were affecting my taste.... but now. This product does something horrible, I only used it maybe three times and now I'm wondering when and if I'll be able to eat food normally again. There are so many reports online from users experiencing the same thing it makes me sick. I rarely ever write reviews but I felt I needed to do at least something."
5.00,"My mouth felt so fresh and clean for a very long time after brushing!"
4.00,"Brushing with this product made my mouth feel clean and sparkly. It also helped with my plaque build-up that sometimes occurs no matter how much I brush or floss."
4.00,"I like thos one, I have used the other versions in the Crest line of mouth washes and liked them also. Mouth feels cleans. But it could be me, it does not last long."
5.00,"My mouth has never felt so clean. I used to suffer from occasional soreness on cheeks/gums, all gone now. Teeth look great, even with all the coffee I drink."
5.00,"left my mouth fresh without burning tongue and gums"
4.00,"Anyone???"
5.00,"It gives your mouth that dentist office clean!I feel like it cleans where toothpaste doesnt get to."
5.00,"This toothpaste was great. Not only did it taste great, but my teeth felt fresh and clean all day. I will continue to buy Crest Pro Health for myself and my family."
4.00,"it kept my teeth clean & smooth. the taste was pleasant."
5.00,"This toothpaste is great. Makes your mouth feel so clean and fresh and great taste too!"
5.00,"After reading all of the negative reviews, I guess I am lucky to have not experienced any of the bad side effects of this mouthwash. I started using this when I had an awful toothache and could not get to a dentist right away. After a few days, my tooth started feeling better. I have not had any stains, in fact my teeth look whiter. I use the mouthwash every morning after I brush and then once more before I go to bed. I did notice when I first began using it that I would spit out a bunch of purple slime, but as time went on there wasn't any. I am almost out of my first bottle and will definitely buy another one."
4.00,"I tried the new Crest Pro Health Clinical Mouth rinse, and I really liked it. It gave my mouth a fresh feeling without being too medicine-y or overwhelming to me. And the freshness lasted longer than with other rinses I have used. I will definitely recommend this product!"
1.00,"This product is terrible. I should have read the reviews more carefully. I was trying to improve the health of my gums, but instead this product gave me 2 gum sores (look like little holes/indentations) and my the whole area of my gums appear dehydrated. This was after only a short time of use. Going in the trash."
4.00,"I thought the taste was clean and refreshing. Haven't noticed wheter my teeth are whiter or not."
4.00,"We have been using Crest Pro Health for a while now and we will continue too. The mouthwash leaves a very clean feeling."
4.00,"I was hoping that purchasing this item over amazon.com would be cheaper than going to my local Wal-Mart store to purchase, but I was wrong. Oh well. It's still good toothpaste, just not a fantastic price."
4.00,"I really liked this toothpaste. It left my teeth feeling clean and shiny. However, it is a bit over my price range, and I have found that other cheaper toothpastes have similar results."
5.00,"Crest Pro-Health Rinse is the only rinse my family will use. We love how fresh and clean our mouths feel but also love there no alcohol sting."
4.00,"Makes breath fresh for a long time. Excellent taste. Teeth feel nice and fresh after brushing."
5.00,"We have tried every toothpaste on the market (from mild mint flavor to strawberry) for our son with extreme sensory issues. This is the only toothpaste he likes. We love it!"
5.00,"I thought that this crest mouthwash was pretty great. It keeps my mouth feeling nice n clean, but its not as harsh like listerine etc. Great product!"
5.00,"Leaves your mouth incredibly clean and feeling healthy. Does not burn."
5.00,"It doesnt have strong taste but it last long time:)"
4.00,"This is a toothpaste with a lot of claims, but the one I was hoping for was helping with sensitivity. Perhaps, but even on the tube it says \"Do not use for sensitivity longer than four weeks unless recommended by a dentist.\" It doesn't say like my Sensodyne to see the dentist if the problem persists for four weeks. Nonetheless, my dentist has handed me out samples of Crest and the toothpaste has proven to be a good one. Just don't count on it being another Sensodyne because it just plain isn't. The active antihypersensitivity ingredient, potassium nitrate, isn't listed. It does make the claim that it will help reverse gingivitis in four weeks, but regular brushing and flossing should accomplish that with most any toothpaste. The taste of the gel is a nice heavy minty one, but I didn't really care for it as it's strong. It's a quite a bit heavier mint taste than the \"regular\" Crest. If you want to stock up, the expiration date is good at more than a year off. I do appreciate products that aren't set to expire a month after purchase. Many of the Crest products are now Amazon Add-ons, a real plus if you don't need or want large quantities. Crest Pro-Health: ~ Fights cavities ~ Whitens teeth ~ Fights sensitivity ~ Fights gingivitis ~ Fights tartar ~ Freshens breath ~ Fights plaque ACTIVE INGREDIENT: Stannous fluoride 0.454% (0.16 w/v fluoride ion) INACTIVE INGREDIENTS: Glycerin, hydrated silica, sodium hexametaphosphate, proplene glycol, PEG-6, water, zinc lactate, flavor, trisodium phosphate, sodium gluconate, sodium lauryl sulfate, carrageenan, sodium saccharin, stannous chloride, xanthan gum, polyethylene, titanium dioxide, blue 1 lake"
4.00,"Loved the way my teeth felt after brushing them! Gives you the dentist clean feeling."
5.00,"This product really made my mouth and teeth feel cleaner and for longer than my former toothpaste."
5.00,"The mouthwash makes my mouth feel fresh and it doesn't have a strong taste as some mouthwash does."
5.00,"I like the way my mouth feels clean after I use this rinse. I have used many of the Crest rinses and have found this one to work the best. I am really interested in seeing if it actually will reverse gingivitis . I will keep using this line and tell all my friends about how great is has worked for me."
5.00,"This mouthwash was GREAT! It left my mouth feeling super clean and fresh! Other mouthwashes I have tried have left my mouth feeling like their was a film on my mouth! This great product did just the opposite!! I will def be buying this in the future!"
5.00,"I used to be a Colgate only kind of woman. I used that brand since I was a teenager, and now I seriously wish I had used Crest. My mouth just feels consistently cleaner, fresher and all around amazing."
4.00,"My husband loves mouth wash and especially loved this brand! It was great to use in conjunction with the toothpaste and the floss!"
4.00,"have used crest for years and will continue to do so in the future. the toothpaste must work because dentist trips are always good."
5.00,"made my mouth feel wonderful and i would definately by this again."
4.00,"This product leaves my mouth feeling clean and healthy. I have noticed that my teeth are whiter."
3.00,"Has nice taste; not too strong. Nice value. Would buy again."
5.00,"Only toothpaste I use. My dentist recommended it and she gives samples of it to her patients. I highly recommend it."
5.00,"Crest has come a long way. I was always a Colgate fan, however, two years ago I started trying out Crest's Pro Health products (mainly because of a CVS promotion). I am honestly impressed by the quality of the toothpaste. My teeth feel clean without any residue. The mint is crisp without being overpowering or any yucky aftertaste. It is a bit pricier, but I consider it an investment. I combine this toothpaste with the Crest Pro Health Crest Pro-Health Clinical Gum Protection Soothing Smooth Mint Toothpaste Twin Pack 8 Ozfor night time brushes and am going two years cavity free."
4.00,"This product certainly left my mouth with a clean feeling - without the medicinal taste of stronger mouthwashes. It did the job, but in a gentler way. It's a good product!"
5.00,"Crest rinse has great cleaning power, whole family liked"
1.00,"This product does the opposite as advertised. I tried it to see if it work work better than Listerine in controlling plaque that forms near a permanent retainer at the back of my bottom teeth, and after using this two nights the plaque was so bad it felt like i hadn't brushed my teeth at all. In addition, plaque was worse overall on my upper teeth, including in places I've never had problems. My gums are sensitive now and my mouth tastes like peroxide. This went down the drain."
4.00,"Mouthwash that worked well used to taste awful. This is among the newer ones that tastes great and does a good job. I really like the way it makes my mouth feel."
5.00,"This product was great! It made my mouth feel really clean and it tasted good also! No yucky gritty taste, just a great minty flavor!"
5.00,"WOW....awesome toothpaste! After brushing it feels just like you came from the dentist! We have a new toothpaste in our household!! :)"
5.00,"I would recommend this to everyone even my 11 year old likes how it works."
4.00,"Love this toothpaste! My teeth feel clean & fresh!"
5.00,"I absolutely love this toothpaste! My teeth and gums have never been cleaner prior to using it. I have always used crest products due to the quality,but this one surpasses the rest!"
5.00,"I was truly astonished to read all of the negative reviews of this mouth wash.  My entire family has used this product for over a year at the suggestion of our dentist, and we love it.  None of us has had any loss of taste, burning or teeth staining.  In fact, at my last check-up the dentist commented on how much less plaque I had, which I attribute partially to the rinse.  And we like the taste, too (but only the blue, not the green variety)."
5.00,"I really like the rinse, in conjuction with the other products I felt that I had protection all day."
3.00,"Good product, would try again. made my mouth feel so clean I didn't want to eat or drink"
5.00,"I used to use mouthwash rarely. I tried using Listerine but the alcohol burn was too much for me & caused white stuff to appear in my mouth. My husband uses listerine & has no problems. So I went out seeking a alcohol-free mouthwash & tried Crest. The first day I used it my mouth felt cleaned & “rinsed”. At the end of the day I rubbed my tongue against my teeth & they were squeaky clean! This was the first mouthwash that actually put a shield over my teeth!!! I bought the hugest size & haven’t looked backed. Unfortunately Listerine with the burn made me use mouthwash rarely. Using crest mouthwash is actually enjoyable & makes me want to use it & improve my dental hygiene routine."
4.00,"I don't normally use mouthwash because of how most taste. This one left my mouth feeling clean and fresh with that \"stripped/dry tongue\" feeling. I had my husband try it out and he agreed that it was good. We've been using it ever since."
4.00,"A really great product, kept my mouth feeling clean all day."
5.00,"Very good tooth paste with a great after taste. Not too strong, but very clean feeling!"
1.00,"I thought this product would be a great alternative to my old school listerine antiseptic. After using this product I lost taste, my teeth turned yellow, and ulcers began to form all over my mouth and throat. I have never had a mouth ulcer before, but if it ever happens again PLEASE JUST SHOOT ME! After 3 dentist visits, xylocaine/decadron/hydrocodon prescriptions this 5 dollar bottle of mouth wash has now cost me around $230. Thanks crest..."
4.00,"The Crest Pro Health toothpaste made my teeth feel very clean. I really like the product."
5.00,"I've been using the Pro-Health mouth rinse...the non-alcoholic purple one with flouride. It does not leave me with dry mouth, has a pleasant flavor without a strong bite. I also appreciate the flouride as I have a reverse osmosis drinking water system that filters it out. Oh, and the purple color is easy to spot on the store shelf."
1.00,"Even though I use and enjoy other Crest products I hated this toothpaste. My mouth didn't feel clean and the taste was gross."
4.00,"Covers it all ... good clean teeth, fresh breath. Sometimes my teeth are sensitive to certain toothpastes, but this Crest brand was fine with regard to that."
5.00,"I really enjoyed using Crest Pro-Health rinse. My teeth and mouth felt clean, healthy, and fresh all day."
5.00,"It tastes good and does what it says! The tube is not skimpy on product. And the product itself is a great value for cleaning and protecting your teeth."
1.00,"I did not order this particular product from Amazon.com, I bought it in the store. I dont think i have full blown gingivitis , but I do have problems with my gums bleeding a tiny bit for no reason after I brush my teeth. Anyway, I have been using this toothpaste for the past four days and my teeth have slowly been feeling more and more sensitive. I cant drink or eat anything too cold or too hot because the nerves in my teeth start throbbing and my gums feel a little sore. I have never had this experience with any other toothpaste I have ever used ,and it is definitely not my toothbrush. The only difference I noticed is that my gums dont bleed as often, but my teeth stay sensitive and throb throughout the day. It is a very uncomfortable feeling and I think I am going to stop using this product."
5.00,"Other than having a professional cleaning, I really have never had my teeth feel cleaner than they did after using this product."
5.00,"My mouth feels so clean after using Crest Prohealth. That feeling lasts awhile after brushing which is another bonus."
5.00,"I didn't get a sample but have tried this and love the way it makes my mouth feel clean and protected."
4.00,"This is a product that you buy because it gets results, not for the taste.  Personally, I like something like Armand-Hammer, which is more or less just baking soda.  This is a little more gritty/industrial.  Not as good as a whitening treatment, but will certainly help that.                                                                     Some people have talked about being de-sensitized to taste, perhaps because of the zinc.  This has not happened to me."
4.00,"My teeth are clean, and breath is fresh! It felt great to brush with as well."
5.00,"This product was very refreshing and made my mouth feel great."
5.00,"I LOVE the toothpaste. I have sensitive gums (always have) and this is the only toothpaste that manages to stop the irritation, bleeding, and discomfort that I normally feel with regular toothpastes. Well worth trying!"
4.00,"The Crest Pro Health tooth paste worked well, but we did not care for the taste. Because of that we will stick with our Colgate."
4.00,"loved the way it made my mouth feel! refreshed and clean."
5.00,"As with similar products like vitamins, there's not a ton I can tell you from just one tube of toothpaste. I mean it's not like it's going to magically solve all the problems in my mouth with just one tube. It would take some serious orthodontic surgery to fix all the problems in MY mouth. Anyway, if you have less severe problems then this is probably just as good as anything, though I'm sure other kinds are cheaper. I'm just saying."
4.00,"Smooth and clean teeth...will buy again! Great product and will recommend to others. Thank you!!"
5.00,"Left teeth feeling nice and clean and flavor of toothpast was not to bad"
5.00,"No alcohol burn, no bad aftertastes, and none of the weird side effects noted by the other reviewer. I've been using this for 3 years, and I still have all my tastebuds. :-)"
4.00,"I actually like that this mouth rinse doesn't burn when I use it..It is a little on the expensive side though so I use it sparingly.."
1.00,"I was absolutely shocked when I did a Google search to see what could cause the sudden brown staining on my front teeth. Surprise - the timeline of when I noticed the stains matches up perfectly to when I started using Crest Pro-Health rinse. I seriously hope that I can get these stains out with a whitening pen. I contacted Crest with a nasty complaint, so I am hoping that, as others have said, they will pay for my teeth cleaning if it's necessary. So disappointed; who would ever think you need to check the reviews for a mouthwash before buying it?!"
5.00,"These four items contain pretty much all you need for oral health care. They're each good products - glide floss is my favorite brand, and the toothbrush, toothpaste and mouthwash are all good quality and have a fine taste about them. I'd certainly buy one of these sets for someone heading off to college, or moving out on their own for the first time."
4.00,"I like the way it makes my mouth feel so fresh and clean"
1.00,"If I could give this abomination a zero star review, I would. I'm a Sonicare user and floss daily. My semi-annual cleanings are stellar -- almost no plaque, three cavities in my life, and all my own teeth. I like to use mouthwash and got tired of Listerine (works well, but not exactly flavorful), so I picked up some Pro-Health, which I used regularly. I don't normally look in my mouth, but one evening, after a few months of Pro-Health, I peeled back a lip to examine the roots and gum line, and YEE GODS!! It was like looking in the mouth of a cadaver! Hideous dark brown stains at the root line, and on closer examination some of the same stains between several teeth. I got on the Internet and did a search for teeth brown stains, and there it was -- Crest Pro-Health. I dumped my supply, but nothing I could do would get rid of those stains. Went to the dentist and she removed them with no difficulty. It has now been six months, and I use only Plax and Listerine. Not a trace of the stains."
1.00,"Wish i could rate zero stars. I got this from a friend who is a dentist. I asked for some oral care products and he sent a big grab bag for me.I wasn't planning on using this toothpaste but I left my Sensodyne behind while traveling. I used this toothpaste twice today. I didn't like the flavor. I used it at 4:30 because my mouth needed refreshening and it left a bitter taste. I used it again before I went on a date at around 8:30 pm. I asked the waitress to bring a big water for me and I guzzled it because my mouth was so dry and bitter. I am guessing that by 9:30 or so my mouth discomfort elevated and hurt so much. It seemed like the food was hurting my mouth because it just kept getting worse and the food was so unpleasant to feel in my mouth. I was trying to eat a mild quiche I have had many times, creamy and far from assaulting and causing mouth pain. I felt like I had been rubbing my tongue on my teeth all day or that feeling of a burn from pineapple enzymes. I thought that I might have had more stress than I realized today and perhaps didn't notice rough tongue movements because my tongue was just so sore and it was getting worse all along the sides, especially where my tongue rests on my bottom molars.Not long after I got home did I realize that I have huge canker sores and painful white bumps all along my tongue. They weren't there this morning and I realized that all day I enjoyed the feeling of a cheek bite that was finally all healed. In other words my mouth felt good and free from irritation before I opened this toothpaste at 4:30. My tongue really hurts now and my cheek lining is peeling. The spot where my newly healed bite was is now swollen and skin i hanging off of it. This is a total chemical burn and irritation.In the morning I plan on going to the grocery store and buying Benadryl Elixer and Milk of Magnesia to make an oral rinse solution that stops tongue pain from burns and cankers and other things that make tongues sore like thrush. This is first aid for your tongue and it will stop your pain while you heal.Seriously, if your tongue and mouth and lips became sore and your mucosa sloughed off after use, you got burned and you deserve some first aid. I don't plan on suffering for one minute after the store opens. I will be rinsing my mouth out with anti inflammatory Benadryl and Milk Of Magnesia first thing in the morning.I have had inflammatory issues most of my life, including skin inflammation so perhaps that is why this product harmed my mouth so fast. I swell from injuries and sometimes a small irritation will cause a sore on my skin because my blood inflammation levels are very high. However lots of people have inflammatory issues that they may or may not be aware of and so I think there is a big risk being burned immediately or irritated after several uses of this product for anyone, especially those with inflammatory issues such as allergies, digestive issues and rheumatoid arthritis, etc."
5.00,"I love this Crest mouthwash. It felt nice and bubbly as I was swishing it around my mouth, like it was cleaning very well. After using it, my breath smelled great and my mouth felt clean. I love the flavor and feel that it is very effective."
4.00,"I don't have any bad to say about Crest 'clinical' toothpaste. It worked really well for me, I liked the way my teeth felt after brushing."
5.00,"The Crest Pro Health toothpaste is an excellent value. My teeth feel cleaner and my mouth feels fresher for a longer period of time. I am looking forward to trying more products from this line."
4.00,"Love Crest ProHealth toothpaste! It is effective and works just as advertised. The only problem is it is a little pricey!"
5.00,"I was very pleased with how the Crest Pro Health mouth wash made my mouth feel clean and fresh for a longer period of time."
5.00,"I see a lot of negative reviews about this product. I wanted to try it , because I've been reading about how many people claim that it burns. So far I've had no issues, and my mouth feels clean, refreshed, and the taste (while not great) is adequate. I understand that everyone's mouth and dental work has its own sensitivity, but generally speaking, this toothpaste attains its goal in prevention. I recommend this paste for those with an open mind and who want good results. If it burns, then I guess that certain individuals are more sensitive to it."
1.00,"Just came back from the dentist, they were literally shocked looking at my teeth. Brown stains throughout the bottom row of my teeth, it took well over an hour to get the stains out, the hygenist had her work cut out for her. They both thought I had started smoking, My dentist was in literal shock stating \"I have never seen your teeth look this way\" I am seriously interested in getting together some sort of class suit against this company. NOT fair to consumers, I repeat do not use!!!"
4.00,"I used the product and was satisfied with the feeling of clean that I have come to expect from Crest (I've grown up using crest and rarely deviate from it) but, I did notice after brushing that I had a strange aftertaste...it's not enough for me not to use it but still a little strange"
5.00,"In trying Crest Pro-Health oral rinse, I found the flavor to be nice for a mouth rinse. After rinsing, I was left with a clean feeling and fresher breath. Having tried this product and reading the product label again, I felt convinced that the product description was believable."
5.00,"I loved the difference I felt as soon as I brushed my teeth. I thought my old toothpaste was doing a great job but it did not compare at all to Crest Clinical."
5.00,"It didn't burn and was minty plus kept my breath fresh all day! I really like it!"
4.00,"This product leaves a good taste it is refreshing. It cleans I have seen good results since using this product."
4.00,"Love using this product it made my teeth feel white and clean so clean"
4.00,"I resently tried the crest pro health toothpaste. I enjoyed the taste and the mouth feel. As someone who enjoys getting her teeth cleaned at the dentist this toothpaste left my teeth feeling staight from the dentist."
5.00,"I have sensitive teeth and Crest Pro health not only cleans my teeth and gives me fresh breath it helps with the sensitivity of my teeth. I used to use a specific sensitivity toothpaste which costs a lot more and Pro health does the same thing for less money!"
5.00,"I really enjoyed how fresh and clean my mouth feels after using this rinse. I really enjoyed the taste, and from reading the bottle, I know it is really a great product."
5.00,"My mouth feels clean and fresh at all times with the crest pro-health clinical mouth rinse."
5.00,"I was really impressed with this toothpaste. It tasted great and it made my teeth feel really clean. I have a lot of trouble with plaque and I believe it is helping significantly. We will see next time I see the dentist!"
4.00,"it is a very good product. I love crest products. I think it is a little high in price."
5.00,"I thoroughly enjoyed this drink. It kept a nice, thick, consistency until the last cup. It reminded me of the more expensive by the cup drinks from the stores. This is definitely worth the price."
4.00,"I loved how my teeth felt after using this product. my breath felt fresher, too :)"
5.00,"This was a great product. Crest always delivers a great product. My teeth haven't been this good in a long time. Love it."
5.00,"The mouthwash doesn't have a lot of alcohol in it. And my breath stays fresh longer than scope, and listerine."
5.00,"I loved this product from the very first use. I feel like it really gets in between my teeth for a great clean."
5.00,"This product tastes great & makes you teeth feel very clean."
4.00,"All of the products work wonderfully. Taste fresh, and no problems. Not the best manual toothbrush I have used, but definitely worth the price."
5.00,"As soon as I received this toothpaste I tried it. I liked its consistency, was surprised it had no gritty texture, considering it is advertised as a \"whitening\" paste. I liked it so much, after I finished it, I bought three tubes at my local pharmacy"
3.00,"I really liked the way this toothpaste worked, but I didn't think it performed much better than my regular toothpaste. It's got a good flavor and is high quality, but I didn't notice any extra benefits."
5.00,"I love Creast mouthwash I highly recommend it. It's not too strong and doesnt burn your mouth or leave it dry."
1.00,"Did not purchase through amazon, i bought it at a store. used product for about a month because when i brush my teeth i have slight bleeding. Gums still bleed and my lips got bumps on them that hurt and feel like burning. spread all over lips. looked like i was wearing bright red lipstick with bumps. My cheeks started peeling. Got to the point that i stopped flossing and using mouthwash because my mouth was in pain. Had to constaintly have vaseline on lips. stopped using toothpaste and next day already felt relief! NOT RECOMMENDED!"
3.00,"This is a mouthwash. Plain and simple. I did not notice a particularly special clean sensation from it. It seems to do the job of a good quality mouthwash making my mouth feel clean after rinsing. Was it better than any other? I have no idea. I take good care of my teeth and the dentist didn't indicate anything was better or worse at my last check up. I am sure it is a god product for its purpose but can't say whether it is \"special\"."
3.00,"I confess I haven't experienced the numbness, loss of sense of taste or tooth staining others have done (though my tongue does turn an interesting shade of lilac for a while after I use it), and I can honestly see where those things would be a big problem. Being one of the fortunate ones lets me move on to the good and the bad as I see them. First the good: It does still sting a bit when you use it full strength, but nothing like many of the mouthwashes on the market. It's not unbearable to use. It also seems to do the job it's meant to do, though I suspect that the larger issues of plaque and gingivitis are going to be harder to evaluate since those are both long term and dependent upon the user NOT having something happen. I do, however, have a minor plaque problem -- mostly brushing thoroughly takes care of the worst of it -- and no gingivitis. When I visit my dentist next, I imagine he'll let me know if the Crest is working. I'd happily wait to write this until I consult with him, but I only just saw him a bit ago, so it's going to be a while before I go back. To be honest, I think most mouthwashes are pretty much equal. If my mouth feels clean and my breath isn't offensive, and I don't suffer the torments of the damned while I'm using the stuff, I consider it a success. While I haven't suffered any of the negative effects, as I indicated above, I'd have to say that Crest isn't so great it's worth the risks, but in the end, you're the only one who knows whether you want to take those risks or not. Honestly, if I hadn't tried it before I read the other reviews, I might never have tried it at all. I wish Lavoris was easier to find..."
5.00,"I got this through the Amazon Vine program, so I didn't have to pay for it. But I will in the future, because it is nice-tasting; minty without beeing too sweet or too medicinal. And it works, too -- my teeth definitely feel cleaner since using it. Before, I was using Listerine, but I will switch. This is as effective, and tastes better."
5.00,"Really great product does exactly what I expected. Highly recommend!"
5.00,"Love this product, left my mouth feeling so clean and all my teeth were sparkling!"
4.00,"I love Crest Glide dental floss. It never gets caught in any of my dental work. I've tried lots of other brands, but Glide is the best for me."
4.00,"I purchased Crest ProHealth Clinical Plaque Control for my husband ( I have dentures). From the first time he used it he commented on how clean his teeth felt and that the clean lasted throughtout the day. I have to say, it also gave him fresh breath for a long time."
4.00,"This products works really great and has a nice refreshing taste. I would give it a 5 star however I am not a fan of the foaming action that it created."
4.00,"I found it got my teeth clean and the flavor was good."
5.00,"I picked up my Crest and Glide Pro-Health just a week ago, I really like both products. I've always used Crest and have used Glide since it first came on the market. My teeth feel so clean and, well slickery (my own word). I will definately purchase Pro-Health from now on. Oh, and I was at my dentist this week and he told I was using the right products!"
4.00,"When you're exercising, you should feel the burn. However, one place where you may not want to feel the burn is with your mouthwash. I really enjoyed using this mouth rinse. It left my mouth feeling clean & fresh."
5.00,"I really liked the rinse. It did not smell like alcohol and had a pleasant taste to it. This is a great addition to health care for your mouth."
4.00,"While the taste took a little getting used to (I normally like a strong mint taste) I thought that overall the toothpaste was really good. It really left my mouth feeling clean, the same way they after the dentist but without the pain! I would definitly reccomend this to my friends."
5.00,"I used the new toothpaste for two weeks and my teeth look and feel cleaner. The taste is good. I also went to the dentist yesterday and they ask me what I was cleaning my teeth with? They even noticed how great they looked. Way to go Crest for another wonderful product!"
5.00,"Clean and refereshed mouth cant go wrong with Crest products"
5.00,"I love this rinse and have made it a part of my evening routine."
4.00,"My family usually uses another brand because we can always get it extremely cheap and we are on a budget, but I am definitely thinking about forking over a little extra to continue buying this toothpaste. My teeth and mouth feel much cleaner than they do when I use my regular toothpaste and I can feel it working. I just wish it wasn't so expensive because it is probably the best product on the market."
4.00,"My teeth felt clean and smooth after using this. I would recommend this product to any one."
5.00,"I REALLY LIKED THIS MOUTHWASH!!MUCH BETTER THAN OTHERS I'VE TRIED, ALSO LOVED THAT IT DIDN'T TASTE LIKE TOO STRONG."
5.00,"I believe that this toothpaste is an excellent product."
4.00,"I wanted to try this product to see if Crest had changed anything really with their products. I have never been a big fan of them due to the strange mouth-feel I get whenever I use them. But this one was decent enough. I'm not sure if I would make a staple of my tooth cleaning routine."
1.00,"After several months of use my mouth became irritated and red as if it were burned and my lips became swollen and cracked. When it kept getting worse I realized it may be the toothpaste so I switched to my previous type. After about a week my mouth returned to normal so I tried the Pro Health again. I had an immediate reaction that took 5 days to heal. My mouth is in excellent health as long as I don't use this toothpaste. My husband is now beginning to react to it in a similar way as I do. There is some ingrediant in this product that causes damage to the mucus membranes and it should be taken off the market."
5.00,"Simply put AWESOME! My mouth is brimming with life now!"
5.00,"I really loved using this toothpaste because it left my teeth feeling clean all day. It left a good, clean taste in my mouth that didn't fade away for hours. I would recommend this toothpaste to anyone."
4.00,"I really loved this rinse. My mouth felt so clean and fresh afterwards. After using for a few weeks, I feel like my mouth is dentist clean. That is really impressive."
1.00,"Look at the most recent reviews of this stuff - I don't know, maybe they changed their formula, but all the recent reviewers seem to have the same problems I have. Every time I use this, I spit out chunks that don't come out when I swig water - and they're dyed BRIGHT GREEN. Also, my whole mouth goes numb - not in that clean minty way, but in an I-can't-taste-food-for-hours way. I've looked this up elsewhere, and a lot of people have experienced these problems, as well as others who've experienced dramatic staining on their teeth.Look elsewhere. This stuff will mess your mouth up."
5.00,"I think this tooth paste is amazing your teeth feel super clean every time you brush and the result are great !"
5.00,"My daughter starting using this product and loves it. She has had many cavities since she was a young child. This product helps keep her teeth in good shape! Thanks Crest!"
1.00,"I'm surprised to see the glowing reviews this toothpaste is receiving. I just came back from the dentist and the hygienist asked why my teeth were stained. I told her we had switched to Crest pro-health toothpaste. She immediately knew that was the problem. She had trouble removing the stains, especially near the gums. I searched the internet and found many warnings about the staining problem, mostly with the mouthwash, but also from the toothpaste. I have never used the pro-health mouthwash. There are also reports of mouth ulcers and loss of taste due to use of this product. There is a warning on the label that the active ingredient, Stannous fluoride, may stain the teeth. I never thought it would stain so badly. I'm surprised that the FDA hasn't gotten involved in this. Crest seems to be turning a blind eye."
1.00,"Do you ever wonder what the purpose is of those little blue grits they add to your toothpaste? No, it's not for anticavities or antigingivitis. Instead, it's for decoration. That's right. Those little blue grits inside this toothpaste are polyethylene (aka plastic). I am a dental hygienist who occasionally finds little blue specs on the gums of my patients. I never knew what they were (it wasn't taught in school to us) until I stumbled over an article that explained everything. I now tell my patients to avoid Crest all together and to instead search for natural toothpastes without all the harsh chemicals."
5.00,"I just purchased 3 of the 4 products a few days ago.I've only used the toothpaste a couple of times,but I do love the way it makes my mouth feel really clean."
5.00,"Thus mouthwash contains no alchol! Taste is great and leaves my mouth feeling clean and refreshed. Have used it after brushing and flossing and also just to freshen my breadth before leaving house."
4.00,"This mouth wash is great. Leaves a clean feeling without the burn."
5.00,"This Crest Rinse is amazing. My mouth feels so fresh and clean for hours. I am so glad I purchased it."
5.00,"My one word review of Crest Pro-Health would be: Invigorating! This really makes my teeth feel clean."
4.00,"I really enjoyed using this toothpaste. It made my teeth feel really clean after use. I would definately recommend."
1.00,"My teeth used to be white. This product turned my teeth to be yellow and brown on some teeth. I bought the product because I was having gum pain. I didn't realize I made a terrible mistake in my life. I ended with yellow teeth and the gum pain didn't go away. Please stay away from this product!"
5.00,"I have used all sorts of rinses in the past and this one is amazing. My teeth felt extremely clean, it has a pleasant taste (compared to other brands), and even the next morning I could feel that my mouth was still clean. The only thing I didn't care for was the foam that seemed to cling to my tongue and gums afterward. I didn't want to rinse again with water, but I felt like there was a residue left behind. Other than that, it is fantastic, and I will continue to use it!"
5.00,"It works great on cleaning your teeth and making them feel so smooth! I love this toothpaste!"
5.00,"My gums and teeth felt really clean. There was no burning that you get sometimes with other products. The value was fantastic. This is a great product my family was use again and we will tell everyone about!"
5.00,"After one try I can tell this mouthwash is different from all the others. Hours later my breath still smells fresh. Definitely will be buying again once I run out."
5.00,"Great mouthwash. Teeth feel fresh and clean, nice taste, doesn't \"burn\" like listerine. An item I will buy in the future!"
4.00,"I used this product at night and in the morning after brushing. I felt that it really helped me teeth have that clean feeling for longer!"
5.00,"I LOVE,LOVE,LOVE this toothpaste,it makes my teeth feel clean when I run my tongue over them. After 15 years of using the same toothpaste,I changed"
3.00,"It was okay but didn't notice it was that different from the normal Crest. But I don't like mint so that makes me think they all are kind of yucky. It did feel clean but then so does the plain Crest."
4.00,"I love how it makes my teeth feel clean for a long time. The one thing I dont like is the texture of the paste! But I can get past it for the long lasting clean feeling!!"
5.00,"Such Great price. Item arrived very fast. Item arrived as described. Hard to find in stores. I loved it it!"
5.00,"I always trust in Crest to deliver a great product & the Pro Health Rinse was not a disappointment. After my routine, my mouth feels refreshed and very clean without the medicine taste. I hate the medicine taste!!! Can't help but run my tongue over my teeth, AHHHH. Thanks for another great product!!!"
5.00,"This toothpaste has a pleasant taste, it makes me feel like my teeth are getting clean."
4.00,"I really liked the Crest Pro Health Plaque Control Toothpaste. It left my teeth feeling squeaky clean. And it left them feeling clean most of the day! I really feel it made a difference."
5.00,"Have always used Crest ever since I can remember. Will not use other brands. Crest has quality products that you can trust and this is just another great example of one of those quality products. Love the toothpaste,floss, mouthwash, and toothbrushes. They are all used daily by my entire family."
4.00,"The mouthwash leaves my mouth feeling clean but I miss the tingle that comes with most other mouthwashes"
4.00,"I really like the foamy action of the rinse. I can see it get into the spots that need attention along the gumline and inbetween my teeth. Plus, it never stings. I asked my periodontist about this mouthwash and they weren't impressed. Since I'm the one using it, I have to say it works well for me!"
5.00,"Something that I certainly didn't expect - this four item 'tooth care' kit was shipped in a crate-like package. Comes with four items that do (in every) sense of word - help keep your teeth healthy, clean and lasting. Here, you get a 6 oz. tube of Crest Pro-Health toothpaste, a Crest Oral-B tooth brush, Oral B-Glide dental floss and a 33.8 ounce bottle of Crest Pro-Health Multi-Protection (Alcohol Free) mouth wash. Sure, the mouth wash here may taste a bit strong - but do keep in mind that a lot of those sweet / pleasant-tasting mouth wash brands [that do contain some alcohol] are not 'as good' for your choppers - as some of those cheap-o brands tend to wear down your tooth enamel. At least, that's what my last two dentists had told me. Crest - has obviously come up with an ideal (as well as marketable) tooth care line of products."
1.00,"After just one single use of this mouthwash, I have lost my ability to taste!! Woke up this morning with a strong metallic taste in my mouth, and despite brushing my teeth twice today (soon after i woke up, and after lunch), i still can't taste any of my food, and not just any food, but spicy Thai food and chocolate ice cream!! And even when not eating, my tongue and mouth just feel funny - kinda soapy and numb.                                                                     Maybe since it's only been one day, i've not seen very noticeable staining yet, but i've heard from so many others about how their teeth stained sometimes irreversibly, from as soon as one use, and also from extended use. Beware!"
4.00,"Wish it was a little less costly, but does help with those between teeth rinses for my non-compliant children that don't want to floss every day!"
5.00,"I love this product. after using i continued to feel the lasting effects."
5.00,"My new tooth paste from now on!"
4.00,"I love whole product line and it keeps my smile healthy"
5.00,"This is a great product that has been great hands down. This is a great price for your money. :)"
5.00,"My teeth felt clean & smooth, almost like they do after an office visit."
1.00,"Like many others I have experienced some horrific teeth stains from using this product. After only a couple weeks I look like I have been a tobacco user for my whole life. I really wish I had read reviews on it before trusting the product, but I bought it in a store without thinking much of it. Why would you ever expect a mouthwash to stain your teeth brown? As always, hindsight is 20/20. Personally I have not noticed any loss of my sense of taste that others have mentioned, but the stains are downright disgusting."
4.00,"I like the way this toothpaste makes my teeth feel so fresh and clean."
5.00,"I purchased this after finding out I did indeed have excess plaque. This toothpaste tastes good, has a pleasant after taste, and my check up showed the toothpaste indeed helped the plaque problem. Anyone with teeth problems should buy this toothpaste. The cost is minimal. Compared to going to your dentist for plaque removal."
1.00,"I take good care of my teeth and have them cleaned every 4 months since I get gingivitis easily. I decided to try this toothpaste. I have been using it for about 2 months with no problems but last night I noticed my teeth had some brown stains on them. I looked at the back of the tube and it said it could stain teeth, I wish I had paid more attention to that before. The last thing I want from a toothpaste is stains so I have to give this toothpaste a poor rating."
5.00,"It has everything I need in this type of product. Although I say it is of average value, it could be considered better because of all the benefits. I was comparing to other similar products, however."
1.00,"The taste is not good. It does not foam up, half way through brushing your teeth there is no tooth paste left."
4.00,"I generally like this product but I wish they could produce a mouth wash with a better taste."
4.00,"I enjoy trying the product and how it made my mouth feel refresh"
4.00,"I would recommend this product. My teeth felt clean"
5.00,"I really liked this product it made my whole mouth feel clean and smooth. I also liked how when I ate my breakfast and felt my teeth afterward they still felt clean and smooth."
5.00,"I really was impressed with the overall result after using this product! I highly recommend it!"
5.00,"I love this toothpaste. I can almost feel it cleaning everyone of my teeth. It tastes great too but I can actually feel it working. I can't wait to go back to the dentist!"
5.00,"This product works very well, giving that clean, smooth teeth feeling! It is now my toothpaste of choice. Refreshing taste also!"
5.00,"I have used Crest Pro Health for over a year now. I have dentures so one might wonder why I use a top grade toothpaste? The answer is that this leaves my mouth so fresh feeling and it does clean my dentures very well. I have tried other toothpastes, including other Crest types, but the Pro Health is super."
1.00,"used it once at night time then again in the morning and thats when my tongue started feeling a bit weird had some juice tasted a bit funny but didnt felt concerned until later on in the day when i had lunch and still could not taste anything its been almost twelve hrs and my taste is still gone"
4.00,"In some sense, toothpaste is toothpaste, and you can only do so many different things with it. While I haven't noticed any great increase in my oral health, I haven't noticed a great decline either. The only methods to really evaluate this product effectively are taste (acceptable, without being overwhelming) and texture (not overly displeasing). I will probably keep buying until and/or unless I find something less expensive with similar stated benefits."
1.00,"This stuff should be pulled from the shelf! It has left my teeth with brown stains after I've spent 100's to get my teeth white. It has also messed up my tastebuds and the flavor of food has changed. DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT!!!"
4.00,"I liked this product, especially the fact that it is free of alcohol. It had a very pleasant taste and it left your mouth with a fresh and clean feel."
5.00,"The only one that I had a chance to try is the toothpaste. It works well, leaves your mouth feeling clean and it has a great taste."
5.00,"I love the ProHealth Whitening. I can already tell a difference and my teeth feel so clean."
5.00,"I love Crest. Made my teeth feel very clean. Great product."
5.00,"This product does just what it says. I have been using this mouthwash for over a year now ever since my dentist recommended it. I tried the others. Now,I have the confidence that my teeth are healthier and my breath fresher. I use it after EVERY meal. Believe me when I tell you, I use no other kind!"
4.00,"First, I know the reviews on this are mixed...and many point out the possibility of \"teeth staining\" when using these products. I must admit I don't read the packages as good as I should. I also do not tend to search out websites and product reviews on something as simple as tooth paste or floss. With that being said, I DO buy and use products that I have used in the past with good luck, and with a brand I normally trust. Second, I used ALL the products in this kit for about 15 days. I do not notice any teeth staining, but I am not sure how long that would take to be an issue?! I think the tooth paste has a great minty flavor and it does not seem to \"gum\" up the end of the tube like some tooth pastes do. I love, love, love the floss. It is super \"slick\" and does not get \"stuck\" on those hard to reach/tight spaces in your mouth. The tooth brush is another love! The tooth brush has small bumps or ribs on the back of the tooth brush that invigorate your cheeks while brushing. This makes for a great \"clean\" feel to brushing your teeth! Love it! The mouth wash is great too. It has a minty fresh flavor but not too strong. I know in the past I have purchased mouth wash that I cannot \"swish\" around for more than 10 seconds without feeling I have burned the inside of my mouth! This product leaves a great clean, fresh feel without the burning side affects. Overall, if the price is listed \"right\" when you purchase the collection I can't imagine any issues, other than \"if\" indeed this stains your teeth. In all honesty, I feel as though most products have some horrible side affect if we read the fine print to every product. In the years I have used Crest products I have yet to have an issue."
1.00,"I bought this on Monday. I couldn't figure out why my tongue was sore after using this product 3 times. My tongue has a cut in it, my lips are swollen, and even under my tongue hurts. The last time I used it was Wednesday night and here it is Saturday and my tongue is still hurting. The taste was really off when I went out to dinner with friends on Wednesday night. Now I know why. I too have pretty much only used Crest toothpaste my whole life but picking up this bottle was a HUGE mistake. It looked like it would be so good for me...WRONG! Do not buy this!!!"
5.00,"Have been using this brand/type of toothpaste forever and love it. Will never switch to a different kind and have had no teeth problems since using it (although not many teeth problems ever, thankfully)"
5.00,"After brushing my teeth they felt cleaner then in the past. My mouth was refreshed and I was happier witht he results. I will continue using this new line of Crest products."
5.00,"This toothpaste is perfect! Not too minty, yet you can feel it cleaning every nook and cranny in your mouth!"
5.00,"Love it feels fresh and clean would recommend to anyone"
5.00,"My teeth feel clean all day. I don't have that gritty feeling as the day goes on. Doesn't taste bad either."
4.00,"Fine product but not noticably different from other toothpastes."
4.00,"I felt I had just come the dentist but with out the pain. My teeth where visibly cleaner and whiter. It left a fresh taste and my teeth where silky smooth."
5.00,"We had no cavities or plaque to speak of when using this tooth paste and mouth wash. It was not a bad taste and works very well on all ages. No cavities or deep cleanings needed this past year !"
5.00,"This is THE best mouthwash and toothpaste I have ever used. Effective and does not burn."
5.00,"I'm always trying different toothpastes to find the one that leaves my mouth feeling clean for the whole day. My search is over! This toothpaste made me feel like I had just left the dentist chair minus the slight soreness from all the machines. I will never be able to go back to all the other toothpastes!"
4.00,"I had been using since my teeth are sensitive. I decided to try this Crest toothpaste since it seems similar. Both have similar tubes/caps - I like that they stand up taking up less room on the counter. However, I like the Crest flip cap better - easier access. Since I've been using Crest - I have not had any sensitivity coming back, so I think that part works. I've noticed any difference in whitening. The taste is very strong (and stronger than Sensodyne). The biggest thing I noticed is the texture - it seemed thick and a little gritty. After I rinsed, I didn't feel there was anything left in my mouth, which was good. I did not experience any irritations like some people have mentioned. I think its a good paste, but it depends on whether you want something that is strong and thick or not."
3.00,"OK...it's a mouthwash....I don't really know what to say. My teeth didn't turn brown from it, I didn't loose my sense of taste the next day and my mother's hair didn't curl up from it... jk. Seriously, I did not have a bad experience from it. It did burn a little but I haven't had a mouthwash that didn't. I always feel that the burning is killing the bacteria so I am OK with a little burn for the first few seconds. I don't think my teeth are any whiter or cleaner but I can say that my mouth feels fresher after using it. : )"
1.00,"I have been using this toothpaste about 2 weeks. I started noticing a whitish, slimy film getting caught on my braces. Then it got worse and it was coating the inside of my mouth, lips and gums. It was difficult to remove and would not wash away even with mouthwash. I experienced a burning sensation when I used this and it seemed to dry my mouth out as well. And it was getting worse every time I used it. Since I have braces I brush frequently, even after drinking anything except water. After googling what it could possibly be, I got many hits regarding whitening toothpastes and an over abundance of complaints regarding this toothpaste in particular. When I woke up my mouth was not dry either. I immediately went back to my regular toothpaste and that night I had no problems whatsoever. So it has to be this toothpaste. I was using Colgate whitening prior to this and I never had a problem. I really have to wonder what it is that is causing this problem in so many people with this toothpaste. It also has a gritty texture to it that is unpleasant and leaves a slight burning, drying sensation after using. I would not recommend this toothpaste to anyone. It can't possibly be good for you."
4.00,"I'm not really a toothpaste connoisseur, but I like this one just fine. No cons, but nothing that really stands out either:)"
5.00,"Great stuff. This is my second purchase for Crest Pro-Health gum protection tooth paste here on Amazon.com.                           I have been using it for 2 years now and it is the best toothpaste for me and my gums.                           Thanks again!"
5.00,"All of the products in the line were above average and left my mouth feeling fresh. It's a common known fact that not enough people floss, but the new Crest floss is so invigorating and leaves my mouth feeling BRIGHT!!!"
4.00,"The plaque control toothpaste left my mouth feeling fresh and clean. Definitely recommend this product!"
5.00,"This Crest toothpaste definitely makes a difference. I can tell how much cleaner my teeth and gums feel compared to other brands."
5.00,"was great made my mouth feel so good and fresh would recommend to others to try it and be surprize."
4.00,"i liked it that it didn't burn my mouth and left it feeling fresh and clean"
1.00,"My husband and I had barely used half a tube of this awful stuff when he complained to me that it left a \"film\" in his mouth. I'd been brushing my teeth more frequently, because they seemed coffee-stained and never felt clean. It never occurred to me for a minute that my toothpaste could be the CAUSE of it! I went online and found all these complaints! I'm writing here to offset that phony 5-star rating that was probably submitted by somebody who works for Proctor & Gamble. There's no other explanation for that \"review,\" because this stuff is awful on every level."
4.00,"I really liked the way that this left my mouth feeling after using it, especially in combination with the other products."
5.00,"mouth rinse not harsh at all, toothpaste great felt like it was actually cleaning by gumline"
4.00,"Liked the way my mouth felt after using this mouthwash. I didn't find too much of an aftertaste which I find with crest pro-health mouthwash."
5.00,"I like how it made my breath fresh. I do think it is a little pricey."
4.00,"This is a good product, but it felt a little gritty to me"
5.00,"This works as advertised and it doesn't have a gritty or bad taste that some toothpastes do. Really liked it."
5.00,"This toothpaste is the best I have used. I have sensitive teeth and dry mouth, both of which have specific toothpastes for them, but I think this works better at a comparable cost."
5.00,"I love the squeaky clean feeling you have after brushing your teeth. This toothpaste left me with that feeling all day!"
4.00,"As a life long listerine user this was pretty refreshing. I enjoyed the taste and how long the freshness lasted"
5.00,"Two of the most important aspects in choosing a mouth rinse/washing product is whether it burns the mouth and its flavor. I think that this one wins in both of these respects."
1.00,"When I started using this \"toothpaste\" I did feel some burning like an alcohol based mouthwash and thought, \"That just means it's working!\" WRONG. I got gross white sores on the bottom of my tongue, burned the top, and still have a sore throat. This was only after a couple of days of using it regularly and it has been a week of discomfort and anxiety so far. After my doctor said the toothpaste could be causing this, I read the other reviews. Yikes! Two doctor visits and one prescription later I will never buy crest toothpaste again. Congratulations to the reviewers who did not have their mouths shredded, you must be genetically superior to the rest of us. To anyone who hasn't tried this yet, steer clear. This stuff sucks."
2.00,"For some reason, the flavor of this toothpaste just didn't appeal to me. It was way overpowering! That said, it did a fine job cleaning our teeth, and the clean feeling lasted a long time."
4.00,"I really liked how clean and smooth my teeth felt from the very first time I tried it. My teeth have some really hard to reach areas and it help to keep them feeling clean longer."
5.00,"I really enjoyed using the new Crest toothpaste. It has a great flavor and my teeth really felt clean after using it."
5.00,"I really felt that this toothpaste did the job. My teeth felt clean. I would definately purchase this again."
3.00,"Does not whiten teeth any better than other toothpaste that I have tried. Sorry guys, I wish it did. It is a nice toothpaste but doesn't do everything that it claims."
5.00,"It had my mouth feeling cleaner than my usual toothpaste. I'm officially a Crest fan."
5.00,"After a disappointing visit to the dentist in which I was told that my gums were in bad shape and I had signs of pre-gingivitis as well as some staining on my teeth (non-smoker) I felt I needed to make a better investment into what I was using for oral care.                                                                     The Crest Pro-Health toothpaste was terrific. In the 6 months between dentist visits I used this toothpaste twice a day. It helps that I also have a really great toothpaste (Phillips Sonic Care) and floss regularly; however, I feel that this toothpaste really helped me turn the corner to better oral health.                                                                     I continue to use this as my everyday toothpaste. The deal here on Amazon for a three pack is much better than what you will find at CVS. Happy Brushing!"
5.00,"I really loved this product. My boys only want me to buy it now. :)"
5.00,"I grew up using crest toothpaste and the new crest pro-health clinical plaque control now sits next to my toothbrush. It makes my mouth feel fresh and just knowing that it fights plaque makes it a winner with me."
5.00,"I have a very sensitive mouth, so I'm pretty much scared to try more harsh mouthwashes. My sister told me to give this a try, and I was surprised that not only did it not have the harsh alcohol burn that I associate with mouthwashes, but also that my teeth felt clean up until it was time to brush my teeth at night. I'm definitely purchasing again."
5.00,"This toothpaste is fantastic! I love how fresh and clean my mouth feels, even hours after brushing!"
5.00,"I think that it works great especially for sensitive teeth. Highly recommend this product to anyone and everyone."
1.00,"It's been about three weeks since I bought this and admittedly I rarely used mouthwash before. I thought that the scalding effect on my tongue was just normal and after some time my buds would get used to it. But after nearly a month of not being able to taste much and noticing brown stains on my bottom teeth I had to research it, leading me to this and other online reviews. For a bottle that promises so many pros it would have been real nice to have a more accurate idea of what the cons were. Crest really needs to re-evaluate this line of mouthwashes from the ingredients to the label. Was very disappointed in this and would stop others from buying it."
5.00,"I have yet to try more then 1 product but I did try the toothpaste. I found the taste to be good, I thought with the fact that it helped more it would have a medicine like taste. My teeth felt clean and I have no doubt if I had a recent cleaning it would have helped to prolong the just visited dentist feel."
5.00,"Since the first time I tried Crest Pro Health it is the only toothpaste I will use. I have sensitive gums and then I got pregnant which made them worse. The Gum Protection toothpaste in Soothing Mint is amazing! Crest Pro Health fights gum disease and protects your teeth and gums like no other toothpaste. I would highly recommend this product!"
4.00,"I think Pro Health Clinical Rinse is a good product. I liked the feeling after I rinsed, but the price of it is somewhat expensive."
5.00,"The toothpaste had a good flavor and my teeth felt fresh and clean all day long. The smoothness of my teeth was good as well."
4.00,"But with the savings at subscribe and save it is a no brainier to buy this and have it delivered to the door!"
5.00,"my mouth stayed fresh longer that with other tooth paste. I will use this again."
4.00,"Made my teeth feel nice and clean like I just went to the dentist."
5.00,"i bought the mouth rinse primarily because it said it wouldn't burn my mouth..it didn't!! tasted good...not 'mediciney'...very good product, but a little pricey..guess you are paying for the brand. a very good product!"
5.00,"I really like the fact that the Pro-Health mouthwashes don't contain alcohol. It makes it possible to actually keep the mouthwash in your mouth for the recommended rinse time! I use it at night, and my mouth feels a lot cleaner in the morning compared to times when I don't use it."
4.00,"I tried the toothpaste and thought it was great! Felt clean & fresh for hours. Great product Crest, just like the rest of your line!"
4.00,"I used this toothpaste until it was gone. It worked pretty well removing the plaque buildup on my teeth from spots that were hard to remove with regular toothpaste. The taste was ok... but I figured it was good for what it had to do. I would buy it again."
4.00,"I have no complaints about this product, it got the job done and made my mouth feel clean after rinsing. Don't really think it did a far greater job than other products on the market. Price level was a little high."
4.00,"This was a very good toothpaste. My mouth felt clean when I was done brushing. Some toothpastes leave my mouth feeling like I need to brush again. Not this one. I recommend this to everyone!"
5.00,"Really love this toothpaste! Gets my teeth So clean and lasts for hours!"
5.00,"crest mouthwash is a great product. not only did it leave my mouth feeling very clean but that feeling lasted for hours ! i use other mouthwash at least three times a day but i think i would use crest less throughout the day. the price was ok and the product rocks !"
5.00,"Definitely will keep using. Great product.My family also liked this product very much. Everything it was advertised to be."
5.00,"My teeth felt cleaner and more healthy using Pro-Health Crest. The plaque build up was definitely less."
1.00,"I used this once and lost my sense of taste. I was curious to know if anyone else experienced this and now I know."
4.00,"Crest was never my first choice but I am pleasantly surprised by this product. My teeth feel cleaner after each brushing and I can tell the difference in the morning when I wake up as well. I may just start using Crest."
5.00,"Crest Pro Health mouthrinse is for us. The whole family can use it. I especially love that there is no alcohol in it so it is safe for my son. It leaves our mouth refreshed and protected throughout the day!"
5.00,"I love absolutely everything about the Crest Pro-health, it was really nice to try something different versus what I normally use. I'm those type of people who don't like mouth wash that is too hot, the Crest Pro-health mouth wash was great for me to use, I loved the floss, makes your teeth feel extremely clean, and it was fun trying out new toothpaste, especially to the fact since my teeth are so extremely sensitive! I would recommend these products to anyone!"
4.00,"This was the first time I tried Crest Pro Health toothpaste and I liked it a lot. The flavor was not too strong and it seemed to perform well."
4.00,"I really like the Crest Pro Health toothbrush. My teeth feel cleaner longer. I also like the way it hugs my teeth. It doesn't hurt my gums."
5.00,"It made my teeth feel really clean and my breath was so fresh."
4.00,"Very satisfied with this new formula. Will definitely purchase again in the future."
5.00,"I enjoyed the crest. My mouth felt clean & frsh. My children enjoyed it as well."
5.00,"Left my teeth feeling so clean and refreshed! Ill a"
4.00,"This does what every mouthwash should do: leaves your mouth feeling clean, flushes out anything you might have missed while brushing and freshens your breath for a while after you're done using it. I guess it just isn't anything remarkably different than what is already offered by other mouthwash brands...and even Crest itself. Maybe the difference isn't something I can see or feel (rather, that it's scientific enough that it would take a lab and some equipment to quantitatively measure the success). If that's the case, great! Otherwise, I'm just not convinced I would recommend this over other mouthwashes. That being said, Crest is my go-to brand for toothpaste, floss and mouthwash."
1.00,"I had been using this toothpaste for the past month and noticed that each time after brushing my teeth, the skin inside my mouth would start to peel off. I thought that maybe I was brushing too hard or that the somewhat rough side of the toothbrush was causing this to happen, so I tried to be more gentle, but it just kept on happening. I used a different toothpaste while visiting my parents and immediately the peeling stopped. I just did a little internet research and it looks like tons of people have at the same problem with this product. TERRIBLE!"
4.00,"Not a bad product, as toothpastes go. The flavor was pleasant enough, and it seemed to do a good job cleaning. However, I did not note anything special for \"those over 50\"...a group that I fall into...as far as the touted benefits of the product. I say give it a try...it can't hurt. :-)"
5.00,"I love the pro health line of toothpaste. It seems like they have a line for every type of problem you have."
3.00,"When I first started using this toothpaste, I really liked it and the results I got from using it. However, I hate the cap. I've now had to clean out my bathroom drawer 3 times because the cap leaks. And I've cleaned out the cap I don't know how many time. I would give the product a higher value rating but I feel like I am wasting tooth paste all the time."
5.00,"This product is great!! I love the way my mouth feels!"
1.00,"After using this for a couple of days, the underside of my tongue became very sore and the inside of my mouth developed a persistent burned, slightly raw feeling. A fever blister also popped up on my lip, which may be a coincidence, but I don't think it is.I've used several of the other Pro-Health mouthwashes with no problems, but this one is almost as harsh as Listerine, despite not having the immediate alcohol burn."
5.00,"The mouth rinse left my teeth feeling clean,and my breath fresh. I like the taste too. I think the price could be lower,there are so many similar products,it's hard to spend so much."
5.00,"Niceness, it helps alot, and also the shipping was fast, i would recommend this product to any one else. And would advise them to purchase it from amazon."
4.00,"I also had a chance to buy and use the tooth paste. I liked becaused it cleaned my bad teeth real good and it didn't hurt them. my mouth feels better."
1.00,"All the other reviews were right, that terribad aftertaste also leaves your buds senseless. Don't use this in the morning unless you don't plan on tasting your lunch."
4.00,"I thought this was a great deal and would last us a while but with two people using this daily we are going through it a lot faster than I expected. Not sure its a good deal for couples."
4.00,"It was very pleasant tasting. And did a good job on the plaque. As I have a tendency to get a lot of plaque on my teeth."
5.00,"I love how clean this toothpaste makes my teeth feel."
1.00,"I used this for a few days and it caused brown staining on my teeth. The label does warn about possible staining but says it can be avoided with \"adequate brushing\" or removed with a dental cleaning. I do \"adequately brush\". I would love for Crest to pay for my cleaning that I now need due to their product!!!!"
5.00,"Wow, this stuff is amazing! This is not like a regular mouthwash. This stuff keeps your breath and mouth clean even when you wake up in the morning. The only thing that I don't like about it is the foamy sticky film it leaves in the mouth, but after a few spits in the sink, I was good to go. This stuff really does work well!"
4.00,"I did like how it made my teeth feel clean and smooth but I have tried other products that are normally cheaper that I feel work just as good."
1.00,"After using this product my tongue would feel like it had been burned- dead taste buds and weird metallic taste to anything I was eating. I made the connection after my sister stayed with me and tried it, experiencing the same thing. It lasts at least 12 hours after the rinse, even if I do not eat anything for hours afterward as the label suggests. I would not recommend this- my sister uses a regular alcohol kind and it burns initially but no 12 hour loss of taste!"
1.00,"I had been using Crest Pro-Health Clinical Plaque Control for about a week. I immediately started to get an ulcer in my month. At first, I ignored it, and didn't connect the two. Then, as the days progressed, I started developing more and more ulcers. I had approximately 5 ulcers in my mouth at once after a week's time had passed. The only change I had made was I starting using this toothpaste. I immediately switched to Tom's toothpaste (which my dentist recommended & I HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!) and within a few days, my ulcers went away. The Crest team needs to seriously consider recalling this product. The FDA should not allow stannous flouride to be on the market- the active ingredient. I contacted Crest, but have yet to hear a response from them. A product like this should not be on the market. IT IS NOT SAFE FOR YOU FAMILY. The toothpaste is far too abrasive. I will never but another Crest product again. DO NOT USE THIS TOOTHPASTE."
5.00,"This toothpaste made my mouth feel very clean--shiny teeth!"
5.00,"My family has used Crest for years. We really like how they have improved over the years. This was the first time for the mouthwash. The taste reminds me of peroxide that I had to use as a child for a sore gum. It's a good memory because it makes me feel like it's doing something extra special protection wise."
3.00,"This was alright, but if you are going to buy a Crest product, I would suggest the Crest 3D white line of toothpaste, mouthwash and stripes. I miss the teeth whitening when using these Pro Health products, you know?"
5.00,"It really has a has a great taste & does whiten your teeth too. Makes my teeth feel clean"
5.00,"This works great. I am now a new consumer of this products. Other brands do not compare with this product. Crest really outdid themselves with this."
5.00,"I like the flavor and after brushing, my teeth felt very clean."
5.00,"Kept my teeth nice & clean plus my breath was minty fresh. Cleaned better than some of the other toothpastes Ive tried."
5.00,"Excellent for getting teeth white and keeping them white. I use it every day!"
4.00,"Not a lot to work with but it tasted great and made my mouth feel fresh!!"
5.00,"the nighttime formula is my favorite so far...i'm waiting for this bottle 2 be finished b4 i open another. i have purchased each of the 'colors' but haven't opened the other 'colors' yet"
4.00,"Cleans all around and without intense burning. Gives a fresh, clean minty sensation. I like a little burn, makes it feel like its working"
4.00,"Price was good, not the cheapest though. After using it it felt like i just went to the dentist. The only thing i didnt like was the taste. I cannot describe even, something stale like... Other than that i am still enjoying it."
5.00,"Great product!! Loved how clean my teeth felt after the first use."
5.00,"I loved it. I had a very fresh clean feeling from the very first use."
3.00,"Oral B and Crest are two powerhouse brands for Proctor and Gamble. Bundling their products is a great idea. This grouping contains a 1 liter bottle of Crest Pro-Health, Alcohol Free Mouthwash in Clean Mint, an Oral B Pro-Health, All-in-One toothbrush, a 43.7 yd package of Glide dental floss and a 6.0 oz tube of Crest Pro-Health toothpaste in Cool Peppermint flavor. The Pro-Health All-in-One line consists of 7 benefits. These benefits are: Removes hard to reach plaque. Reduces Gingivitis Cleans along the gumline Polishes away surface stains Removes Odor causing germs on tongue Stimulates gums Gentle on enamel and gums My teeth are fairly close together so I really appreciate that the Glide floss does indeed glide easily between my teeth. The Pro-Health toothpaste is a nicely flavored without being overpowering. The flavor and clean feeling lasts well after brushing. I like the tube design as well with the attached flip up cap. Using the All-in-One toothbrush is like using a few different dental tools. I found the brush head to be a bit large (I have a small mouth for an adult, I even have to get the Junior cardboards for X-rays) so I still had to use my Braun round head rotating electric brush to finish the very back of my mouth. The mouthwash has a pleasant enough taste but it didn't really leave my mouth feeling all that refreshed. I don't like the fact that it contains artificial sweeteners or Blue #1. I usually make my own mouthwash from Peppermint Oil. I think it is dumb to use a blue color in mouthwash as it is just going to stain your teeth. Perhaps that is their diabolical plan to get us to purchase Crest White Strips? It seems convenient to be offered the mouth care kit all-in-one for those that don't like to give that much thought into shopping for mundane hygiene items. I could see including this kit among the other things your college bound kid will need, or your summer camp attendee. It would even be nice to buy a kit and place the items in a pretty basket on your guest bathroom counter for overnight guests. I am giving the kit itself 3 stars because that is the amount of stars I feel would be averaged out if I were rating each product individually."
5.00,"using this toothpaste really made my mouth feel clean - great taste, too"
5.00,"I got this not noticing that it was for those with \"latter-life\" dental issues, but found that it's great for my needs as well. I've noticed a slight benefit in how it's helped with my gum tenderness, and it seems like my enamel's improving, although it's difficult to describe that in words. My guess--great for the older folks, but also good for those with sensitive teeth whom have issues already."
5.00,"This is a superb toothpaste. Does the job better than many in opinion. Teeth and mouth just seem fresher and cleaner longer. Recommend highly."
4.00,"It made my teeth feel clean and my whole mouth fresh..."
1.00,"I went to the doctor with a complaint that I had a really sore mouth and tongue. It was like boiling water (or chemicals) had been swished in my mouth. He had no idea what the problem would be. Eliminated thrush, cold sores, ulcers...all I could do was wait. That was on November 29. I still can't taste properly. But the good news is my gums are now not so sore that they bleed when I try to brush my teeth. I couldn't work out what the problem could be but after reading some of the reviews, can only think it is the toothpaste which I started using at that time - and things improved when I stopped using this one. Try having a constantly sore mouth for a month and see what it does to your quality of life. I am talking about the roof of my mouth, the top, bottom and sides of my tongue, my cheeks and my gums. I will never buy Crest again. It is just not worth it."
5.00,"I saw progress within a few days. It's definitely cheaper than buying whitening strips!"
3.00,"Still using the toothpaste, teeth feel clean, mouth smells minty Fresh. No complaints here. Its toothpaste! I enjoy the 'flavor'."
4.00,"Crest Pro Health Clinical is a great addition to any oral hygien routine. It's not overpowering like some mouth rinses and does a good job of making teeth feel clean."
5.00,"Loved the Crest Mouthwash. It did not burn since it has no alcohol - fresh mouth!"
5.00,"Love it. Keeps your breath fresh for hours. Tastes great too."
5.00,"I love this product! I especially like the way it leaves my teeth smooth and feeling very clean."
1.00,"I purchased this because I was unable to find Crest Sensitivity on a recent shopping trip, and thought it had just been another case of rebranding; not so. I found this product to be much harsher than the 'sensitivity' variety, and where Crest sensitivity can be used without pain, this immediately caused pain during brushing. It may be the formula specific to this type, or the mint flavorant used, but something in this product makes it very uncomfortable to use on sensitive teeth."
5.00,"Great taste and makes my mouth feel clean! Try it!"
5.00,"Loved the brush, the bristles got in between my teeth where I needed it the most, great product"
5.00,"I was very happy with this product, can tell a difference over a regular toothpaste."
5.00,"I love this product! My teeth are white, my gums feel good and I feel secure that my teeth will stay that way."
5.00,"all produces of Crest are great. Would buy crest every time."
5.00,"I just love Crest Mouth Wash because it leaves my mouth feeling fresh and clean."
5.00,"I love this floss works great and doesn't get stuck in your teeth and get all shredded."
4.00,"We started using this a week ago. I like it very much. I have sensitivity issues so rotate between this and enamel protection. I would buy this again."
4.00,"The mouthwash had a refreshing taste to it. It made my mouth feel even cleaner after brushing my teeth. It did not give me a burning sensation in my mouth. Would recommend to anyone."
5.00,"This mouthwash was the best thing Ive ever used. It made my mouth feel so clean and it lasted for hours."
3.00,"I honestly can't say a lot favorable or unfavorable about this product. I've been using it for about a month now. I ordered it accidentally because the product name didn't make it clear it was for people over 50. I happen to be over 50 (51) but not suffering from any of the conditions it's supposed to be helpful with. The taste is just OK compared to other Crest products. It seems to be doing no harm."
1.00,"My local grocery store didn't have my usual toothpaste one day (which is NOT a toothpaste that specifies it is for gum health), so I bought this thinking it would be good as I have battled gum issues most of my life...so much that I have dental visits every three months to make sure everything is staying under control. Normally, my dental visits are very good...everything is under control, no really bad pockets. This last visit yesterday was awful! Two pockets have shown up, bleeding everywhere...I had a feeling it would be a bad visit because of what I've experienced in my own routine of brushing and flossing...it was appearing to me that my gums were getting worse, though nothing in my routine had changed! The ONLY thing that changed was my toothpaste! I don't know what they have in this stuff that is supposed to be helpful, but there is a significant difference than this and my usual toothpaste because this stuff did nothing for me other than make things worse. Luckily, I was able to find my usual toothpaste again at the store, though I had to actually go searching for it at different stores (seems my local grocery store no longer carries my usual), and I will not even be finishing the current tube I have of this stuff. I've also noticed mouth soreness and such since using this product. At first, I noticed it on the sides of my mouth, and thought maybe I was grinding my teeth in my sleep or something, but then soreness started appearing in areas where the teeth would not have rubbed. This was very concerning to me, but after reading some of these reviews, I now understand what was happening. Even another reason to not use this crap! Plan on writing Proctor & Gamble and at least demand a refund."
5.00,"I love the way Crest Clinical made my mouth feel clean after using it."
5.00,"I have been using Crest products for just about half my life, and I am pushing past sixty these days. Very happy with my purchase, very happy with the product, exactly as expected from a Crest brand name, and at a very, very reasonable price to boot. Amazon's purchase price certainly beats any competitor, brick and mortat or otherwise. Recommend the product to anyone out there - again, I have used Crest for years and my twice a year dental exam comes out smelling like roses each and every time."
5.00,"This toothpaste makes your teeth feel so smooth and clean. It also has a great taste."
5.00,"fresh breath lasted all day. felt like it cleaned well"
5.00,"What a great product. It leaves the mouth feeling clean without having to experience that horrible burning sensation that other products produce."
5.00,"I HAVE ALSO USED AND LOVED THIS COMPANY'S PRODUCTS - THIS PASTE REALLY WORKS WELL AND I LOVED TRYING IT OUT"
4.00,"My teeth felt so clean and the taste is really good. It's not too strong but my breath stayed fresh for a long time. My mouth kept that clean feeling for hours too which I loved!"
5.00,"I would have to say that this is the best Crest toothpaste that I have tried!~"
1.00,"I started using this product about 2 weeks ago. I now have two sores in my mouth and my mouth is constantly dry. This happened the last time I bought a Crest product, except there were more sores. After researching the problem I realized that many other people were experiencing the same problems. I will never buy a Crest product again."
4.00,"Makes my mouth feel sparkly clean!! I really like Crest products."
5.00,"I am a Crest user and was interested to try their new clinical plaque control Pro-Health toothpaste. My mouth feels not only refreshed, but clean. At my most recent dental appointment, the hygienist gave a \"thumbs up\"."
3.00,"I found this toothpaste to be watery and gritty. It did not leave a strong minty taste or smell after brushing. It is very pricey."
5.00,"I love how clean my teeth felt after using this toothpaste."
5.00,"This mouthwash makes your teeth feel like you have been to the dentist for a cleaning. I have never had a mouthwash that made my teeth feel this clean before!"
3.00,"I don't think it was terrible, but I have used other products that cost less and deliver the same results."
4.00,"I really like this product and would definetly use it agian."
4.00,"Much better than other mouthwashes because it doesn't burn your mouth and it makes your mouth feel really clean."
5.00,"It makes my teeth feel so clean and fresh for hours. It also provides a lot of benefit. I definitely will be buying more."
5.00,"I like this toothpaste very much and my Dentist recommends it as highly as any toothpaste. Mainly a personal preference."
4.00,"I find this a good, solid toothpaste. I like the clean mint flavor and I do feel that I have less tartar/plaque and my gums seem healthier as well. However, I knocked off one star because I feel there is some false advertising. The toothpaste also says it is effective for sensitive teeth and whitening. It did zero for me in those two areas. I had to buy Sensodyne when my teeth became very sensitive."
4.00,"Love the whitening power of this! It makes me feel confident in my smile."
4.00,"It took a few uses for me to get used to the peroxide in this product. It feels a little different than the type of rinse I am used to, but I do feel that it is effective."
5.00,"Love this mouthwash. I have problems with my gums and this stuff works!! I wouldn't recommend it for anyone that doesn't need such a strong rinse, but it's a lot easier to handle than Listerine. What's even better is that they don't seem to sell this product in this size near me, so finding this was great!"
5.00,"bought the one for sensitive teeth it worked very well.Leaves your month with a clean fresh feeling"
5.00,"It works great! I will continue to use this product. It is so nice to have a product perform as it states it does. Having a fresh feeling all throughout the day is very refreshing and very important."
5.00,"It gave that just-from-the-dentist clean feeling! I really liked it."
5.00,"I use only Crest and it has given me great results over the years. I like using the Crest systems for dental care as it seems to compliment each other."
5.00,"Worth the extra money, this product does all that is says it will."
5.00,"My family and I have always loved crest toothpaste and now we love their rinse just as much. Our mouths felt just from the dentist clean!"
4.00,"Maybe I haven't been using this wash long enough, but I really don't notice any differences from other mouthwashes I've tried. At least it gets the job done."
5.00,"Awesome toothpaste. Felt like I'd been to the dentist for a cleaning. Breath stayed fresh for a long time afterwards."
5.00,"I loved everything about this toothpaste! The flavor was refreshing and it did an awesome job at leaving my teeth feeling clean! This toothpaste will be a regular in our household!!"
5.00,"I love the new Clinical mouthwash Crest has to offer. It leaves such a clean and refreshing feeling in my mouth. My husband has been using it as well, along with the Clinical toothbrush and toothpaste. As a matter of fact, he had a dental appointment a few days ago and the dentist had commented on how well his dental hygiene was. I'm pretty sure my husband's usage of the Crest Clinical products had a lot to do with that! For a dentist to make such a comment means a lot to the product!"
4.00,"I didn't feel or see any big difference at all. Taste was good and maybe with regular use you will be able to see the improvement"
4.00,"This is a great product! It left my mouth feeling fresh and clean. I love this new line of products, especially when combined with the Crest 3D white toothpaste."
5.00,"Love this toothpaste--it is really great for my sensitive teeth and doesn't leave my gums feeling irritated when I use it. Highly recommend!"
5.00,"I am not a toothpaste expert, but Crest Pro is good, refreshing toothpaste. My teeth feel 'slickery' after brushing."
1.00,"The taste was not great, but ok while brushing. The after taste left much to be desired, and it lingered on and on...I will say it left my mouth feeling clean, and if someone liked the taste it would be great for them."
5.00,"We just tried the mouthwash and it is amazing! It didn't burn my mouth and it worked great! The minty taste is the best by far of any mouthwash I have ever used!"
1.00,"I am very disappointed in the cap design on this product. The tooth paste leaks out on my counter top and in my drawers. Very messy and I would not purchase again until the problem of leaking has been resolved."
4.00,"I really liked this toothpaste. The taste itself wasnt horrible and it definetly left your teeth feeling clean."
5.00,"I've been using rinses for years as they have been recommended by my dentist, but besides freshening my breath, I wasn't sure they did much more. But, the Crest Clinical Pro-health really delivered. Not only does my breath feel fresh, but my teeth feel healthy and really clean. I can't wait to see what my dentist says at my upcoming appointment."
5.00,"I've never had much luck with rinses-- they're either just too harsh feeling or too sweet tasting. I was surprised that this one worked just as I had hoped! My teeth feel clean hours after use, and I really think it will make a difference in the long run."
5.00,"if you want something that will take good care of your teeth and keep them white this is a must try."
4.00,"This rinse offers a good value along with the Crest reputation. I prefer it over the Listerine for taste (or actually lack of taste), ingredients, and recommended usage amounts."
5.00,"Love the toothpaste left my teeth feeling clean and my breath fresh. Would definately purchase again."
5.00,"I have had problems over the years with my teeth. I appreciate any product that can help PREVENT problems. I am sold on Crest."
5.00,"Another trip to the dentist with no cavities! Thanks for the help Crest Pro-Health!"
4.00,"My husband loved this mouthwash. I think it is good. Left my mouth refreshed and clean feeling. I agree with a couple of the other reviews that it is on the pricey side."
5.00,"I really liked it. My mouth felt cleaner and fresher and it lasted alot longer than with other brands!"
1.00,"Just tastes awful.  I used it for three days and can't go on.  My container is 4.2 oz and I am throwing out the last 4.0oz.  Avoid."
5.00,"I love Crest Pro Health! I love that the taste is not overwhelming, and that they work. My mouth feels very clean after using."
5.00,"I really liked the taste and the clean feel. I really liked the taste and the clean feel."
5.00,"I'm a loyal user of Crest products and this was a great rinse for me. It left my mouth feeling very clean and fresh."
4.00,"This toothpaste left my mouth feeling as clean as it does after I have been to the dentist. The taste is a little on the sweet side for me but it does make my mouth feel clean. I will definitely purchase this toothpaste again!"
4.00,"I bought this toothpaste for a change from a Colgate 24-hr toothpaste which always made me thirsty after using it.  I like this toothpaste as it leaves a relatively clean mouth feel afterwards but it still takes a couple of rinses to get rid of all of the product.  It seems to have a drop more  fluoride than other toothpastes I have used but it is called Stannous Fluoride so I am not sure if that makes a difference.  I think the gel is a bit thin and I took a point off because the cap is odd in that I cant seem to use the product without getting it all over the inside of the flip cap.                                                                     I have read some of the other reviews and have seen that staining can be an issue.  I haven't had this happen yet so I will update my review if something happens.  The label states that staining could be a problem,  that adequate brushing could prevent the stains, and that the toothpaste is formulated to prevent staining which is kind of funny if you ask me."
4.00,"I have been using straight peroxide to rinse after brushing for about 8 months and picked this up to have something with a little flava. I like the fact that it doesn't have that burning sensation you feel w/ alcohol mouthwashes. Flavor is a mild mint without being overpowering. The only thing I'm not crazy about is the filmy feeling it leaves in your mouth. And I drink coffee all morning long and can still taste the rinse. I feel it's best used at night before bed."
5.00,"It is part of my daily routine. Amazing product. Loved it!"
5.00,"I tried both the plaque toothpaste and the new mouthwash and liked the minty taste and the way it left my mouth feeling. Love Crest products and this is another that I will be adding to my shopping list. Thanks."
5.00,"This product is definitely worth your time to try. It cleans super well and leaves your breath and mouth fresh and clean for a long time."
4.00,"This mouth rinse was recommended by our Dentist. My daughter doesn't mind the taste like she does with some other rinses. Makes your mouth feel fresh and clean"
1.00,"I've tried using this for 3 days in a row, and each time, it hurts my teeth like hell. I thought I just had really super sensitive teeth or something, but looking through the other reviews, I see I'm not the only one with this problem. I switched from Sensodine Whitening, and never had that problem before."
5.00,"This was suggested to us by our dentist 2 1/2 years ago and we have been using it since. My husband had some gum issues and all i can say is after using this our dentist cost is cut in 1/2. we love healthy teeth. Thanks to Crest pro health clinical."
1.00,"I bought this product to keep my mouth clean after my permanent crown fell out. I used it over the weekend without problem, but now I also lost my sense of taste. I even threw away my dinner thinking it was bad. On the plus side, I am not nuts. The downside is, I regret not reading the other reviews before buying this product."
5.00,"This is a great product! I will definitely buy this again!"
5.00,"I love how clean my teeth feel after using this product. We will definitely continue using this!"
1.00,"I took up this toothpaste after I got gingivitis, it made my problem worse! In all sincerity, though on the first day or so it did help \"clean my mouth\" more than other pastes, this definitely made my mouth sore, walls of my mouth peeled a few minutes after use, and there was obvious gum decay, not terrible, but its bad enough. Save your money, I do see a class-action suit coming from someone. ------------------- UPDATED: I've also come to the conclusion that if you do use it, do not by all means allow for the paste to sit on any of your gums. The traditionally recommended 2 min may may allow for the paste to burn more off more than what its supposed to. By burn off... I do understand that if you have some film coming off the \"sides\" of your mouth, that is normal by all accounts professional that I've contacted. Issue arises when it affects the rest of the mouth, and I'm certain it has worn away my gums and made a different problem worse. However, this product is precarious. I'm sure this product may work for some people, most likely already healthy mouthed people, but there are some serious problems here that should be addressed more in a \"prescription\" style manner."
5.00,"After using the crest my teeth felt incredibly clean. In fact, I was inspired to go out and try the crest mouthwash as well, which I also recommend. A bonus was that the flavor was really pleasant."
5.00,"this is a favorite of my 20 year old son. a good addition to his dental care routine! well worth trying!"
3.00,"UPDATE 12/05/12: Dental appointment to check perio. pockets & maintenance- still told that I have the cleanest teeth & the two '6' pockets are now '5', but where are the stains coming from, since my teeth are so clean??? They (dentist, hygenist, perio. specialist) blamed it on my smoking but I remembered some reviews on this product that talked about brown stains especially between the teeth- so I 'researched' this product again, and have determined that it is causing stains; again, all these people couldn't be wrong. So, now I have to decide how significant a part this rinse is contributing to my lack of plaque, and weigh this against these stains- they're not horrible but definitely visable.Until I can decide, I've stopped using it. I don't understand these horrible reviews! I have been using Crest Clinical rinse ( deep clean mint) since about March 2012 and I have not experienced any of these side effects. I am totally surprised and confused, as I see my dentist or periodontist every 4 months, and they say I have the cleanest teeth ever- I, too, had a plaque problem that has resulted in periodontal pockets, so I do have the scaling & planing done every 4 months, but I also do everything my dentist advises, and while he did not specifically say to use this rinse, he did recommend Crest products. I'm wondering if some other dental/ oral problems exist with the other reviewers, but all these people couldn't be wrong or imagining these symptoms, so I will do more extensive research, just for my own knowledge. But as for me personally, I love this rinse and use it twice a day as part of my dental health care. I do floss daily and use an electric toothbrush, waterpik,and this rinse, so my success might be the combination of everything I'm doing, but at my last visit, they could not find any plaque on my teeth, so they then made me eat this 'tablet' that would expose the plaque, and still couldn't find any! But, I'm really wondering about this product now, so will be asking my dentist about what he's heard. Maybe the other reviewers should consult their dental care professional about this, then give us all another review. I certainly don't want to continue with a product that is harmful."
5.00,"I have been using Crest mouthwash for quite sometime and found it to keep my mouth and breath fresher and feel it reduced the amount of germs that breed in and around my teeth."
5.00,"This tooth paste is very good! It cleans your teeth well and leaves your mouth fresh for a long time."
5.00,"I know the dentist says you should always use mouth wash, but to be perfectly honest I have never liked doing it because of the burning sensation that often is associated with them. It's just not a pleasant experience so I didn't do it. Fast forward to Crest Pro Health and this particular mouth wash. I was, as expected, hesitant to try it. I was ready to spit it out at the first sign of that burn. I filled the cap, smelled it, looked at it and just jumped off the cliff and did it. Yet... the burn never happened. In fact, I actually didn't mind the taste at all. It didn't have any unpleasant taste or feeling to it. I've been using this mouth wash for awhile now and have nothing bad to say about it. I have no idea, based on scientific studies or anything if it actually \"works\", but I can say that I don't dread using it. So, that's a definite plus.I figure if there are real benefits to using it that's a win-win for me. I'd highly recommend this one even for kids."
5.00,"Awesome toothpaste. Makes my mouth feel squeaky clean!"
5.00,"I have been trying a lot of new mouthwashes lately, but This crest one has to be my favorite. It keeps my mouth feeling cleaner longer than the others and keeps plaque away all day. I admit the taste of this stuff isn't all that great but with how well this stuff works it doesn't matter."
5.00,"This is a great product. Makes my mouth and my teeth feel cleaner."
5.00,"I would purchase this product again. I shared my experience with my daughter and encouraged her to purchase some for herself and her family."
5.00,"We'll see how good it worked the next time I go to the dentist."
4.00,"Teeth feel extremely clean after brushing. I like the full texture of the paste and the taste is great, not too overwhelming."
5.00,"I love the feel when brushing your teeth. The toothpaste coats my teeth so well I feel as though I am at the dentist. After my breath stay fresh for a long time and in the morning I don't have grime on my teeth."
1.00,"I was having a terrible problem with the inside of my gums around my mouth becoming inflammed and sore and then chapped lips that I could not get relief from. I thought of everything and finally it occurred to me that it started when I began using the toothpaste. This is finally clearing up after stopping the product and using cortisone cream on my lips to calm down the irritation. Beware of this product..........and it leaves a horrible after taste, not like freshly brushed teeth should feel."
5.00,"I regularly use Listerine, but I had my wisdom teeth removed and did not want the alcohol in the Listerine to sting and burn my wounds. So I bought this, and it worked. It barely stung, nowhere near an alcohol sting. My gums had started hurting from plaque and gingivitis since I couldn't use anything but salt rinses at or near my wounds. This cleared those issues up within a few days. There is foaming, but it is clear. I notice the more sugar I've had, the more foamy it is, so I attribute the foam to dead germs. Regarding the bad reviews - I wonder if there was a bad batch distributed, or if a batch was tampered with, or if the people using it may be allergic to an ingredient, perhaps to CPC antimicrobrials or something else in it. I know that I would have similar reactions w/ my allergies. In short, if it works for you, it works really well, and I would check the ingredients for possible allergens or irritants. Try another CPC brand like VitisVitis Orthodontic Mouthwash 500ml, to see if that irritates you too, you may be allergic to all CPC mouth rinses and would have to use Listenine or all natural mouthwashes like Tom's Tom's of Maine Spearmint Cleansing Mouthwash, 16-Ounce (Pack of 3) or Jason Powersmile Mouthwash, Cinnamon Powermint, 16 Ounce or Healthy Gums Antigingivitis Rinse- Peppermint Twist 16.90 Ounces or PerioClear Organic Alcohol Free Mouthwash 16oz. There are many out there. And of course, ask your dentists and dental hygienists! Mine said it was ok except she has more work to do with the slight surface staining (that is mentioned on the label as easily removable). My mouth also feels cleaner overall,so much so, I plan on switching to the entire Crest pro health line."
4.00,"This is a great product. It leaves a clean feeling in your mouth. It lost points with my family because it still burns just like the mouthwash that contains alcohol."
4.00,"I had never tried this particular rinse, but I was very pleased how clean my teeth felt after using it."
5.00,"teeth felt very clean and that feeling longer than other toothpaste"
5.00,"I loved this toothpaste. I brushed my teeth 15 minutes ago and can still feel a little tingle from the toothpaste. The minty fresh taste is nice, too. Definitely recommend!"
5.00,"Loved it! Great taste, clean feeling mouth. I feel almost as clean as when I leave the dentist. What more could you ask for?"
4.00,"It is a great toothpaste that keeps your teeth clena, but is some what expensive."
4.00,"Teeth felt clean. Flavor too medicinal. But overall satisfied."
5.00,"I think this product was wonderful. My mouth felt fresh and clean."
4.00,"I am very picky on my mouthwash we use. This one had a great taste and I enjoyed using it."
5.00,"It was a very strong mouthwash but my teeth were clean and smooth all day long."
5.00,"The toothpaste was very nice. It made my teeth feel cleaner and shinier. I went out and bought a tube for the family to try. Thanks."
5.00,"I read the other reviews and decided to write one. It seems like one review was for a different product. Then another was saying there was a problem with the product being used at night. I use the product morning and night. I've used it for more than 3 years now. Does it control plaque? I can't vouch for this, but my teeth remain feeling smooth to my tongue even after eating sweets. About the product: It's taste is subtle and pleasant. It has a grittiness to it that I like -- reminds me of the gritty stuff a dentist or dental hygienist uses to clean your teeth. It seems to do a great job. Lastly the packaging. It has a lid/cap on a hinge that snaps off and on. No more struggling with a screw cap -- to get it off or on. This cap you can flick open with the thumb. The opening and closing can be managed with one hand. The flat lid/cap I suppose will let you stand the tube upright, but I don't care about that. I'd suspect it would not stand up very well after more than half-used. Anyway. . .I don't know why all toothpastes don't come with an option for this type of packaging. In conclusion: at least this is worth a try if any of the above seems appealing."
4.00,"I love how it left my mouth feeling clean & fresh. Like just coming from the dentist."
3.00,"I was a little leery trying Crest Pro-Health Whitening Fresh Clean Mint Toothpaste because I did not like a similar Crest product Crest Pro-Health Clean Mint Toothpaste 7.8 Oz (Pack of 4)at all. This \"whitening\" version isn't as bad though. I find it to be a good toothpaste, but nothing better than average. The minty taste is OK. Nothing else about it stands out other than it is gritty like most Crest Pro-Health Toothpastes. I have not seen any whitening benefits after using for a couple of weeks. Crest Pro-Health Whitening Fresh Clean Mint Toothpaste to me is just a middle of the road toothpaste. There are many I like better, but I've used worse."
4.00,"I don't really have a problem with sensitivity in my mouth, but this toothpaste is designed to help with sensitive teeth and gums as well as doing all the other things I brush my teeth for: whitening, killing germs, fighting plaque and freshening breath. I don't have much to say about this toothpaste other than I don't mind the flavor, and it leaves my mouth tasting and feeling clean. I'm happy with it."
5.00,"I really like the Crest Pro-Health Clinical Mouthwash. No strong burn, but it bubbles to let you know it's working. Great product."
4.00,"I loved how this made my mouth feel so fresh. A really great product."
5.00,"Crest does it again, great new product! I love this toothpaste! Very clean teeth and mouth!"
4.00,"This product does seem to get the job done. Nice taste, teeth felt clean and fresh. I'm going to continue to go with the toothpaste my dentist recommended to me, but if not, I'd certainly consider this one."
5.00,"My family was very pleased with the taste and performance of Crest Pro-Health toothpaste but we will probably continue to use Crest 3D Whitening."
5.00,"I like the flavor and the toothpaste made my teeth feel very clean"
5.00,"Loved the way it made my teeth feel and look after I used it"
1.00,"My mouth actually felt DIRTIER AFTER brushing than before. Its like brushing your teeth with a grainy fake sugary substance. This is the nastiest toothpaste I've ever used. It CAUSED PAIN in my mouth, teeth and gums. IT's gritty and sandy and way to abrasive. I'll stick with my colgate total clean mint, thanks but no thanks crest. Gross."
5.00,"Very good, made my mouth feel really good after brushing"
5.00,"Makes my teeth feel clean and fresh. Something I would definitely recommend."
5.00,"I value Crest Pro Health, it is the one toothpaste that does everything I want, and I do appreciate the minty flavor. AND the price is very good. Just a quick heads up on this item - it is an add on, which means you need to plan ahead. What I like to do is to add these to my cart until I get enough items for all of them to ship.You can use multiple add on items to equal the $25 to have them ship, so I take advantage of my cart until I am ready to purchase."
1.00,"If your like me you'll try it anyway. I can tell you what my dentist told me. The whitening ingredient of this toothpaste is causing the peeling inside your mouth. I quit using it because of that reason, there are other products to whiten your teeth. But it at your own risk but buy a back-up tooth paste just in case."
5.00,"I really enjoyed using the Crest Pro-Health Toothpaste. It provided a satisfying level of clean and my teeth looked and felt great. I felt like my mouth was protected."
5.00,"This worked great and left my mouth feeling fresh and clean much longer than other brands."
1.00,"I hate this product so much. I bought it at my local Duane Reade store for 6 bucks. I used it that night after i brushed my teeth. I thought everything was good and then i tasted metal in my mouth. It was horrible. I tried rinsing my mouth with some water hoping that would do the trick. When i got up in the morning I couldn't taste anything, my tuna sandwich was paper. My hot chocolate burned my tongue. I pored my bottle down the drain. It may say it doesn't have the burn of alcohol but it burns the taste buds out of your mouth anyway."
5.00,"Great paste that leaves my teeth and mouth feeling almost as clean as when I leave the dentist's chair!"
4.00,"I like this product. It left my teeth feeling very clean, and my breath fresh. It's not the best tooth whitening toothpaste on the market, but that's not really what it is promoting."
5.00,"I loved using the mouthwash. It made my mouth feel so clean and didn't taste too sweet or sugary. I loved it!"
5.00,"For the most part -- toothpaste is just toothpaste, but this does have a nice flavor and leaves your mouth feeling clean and fresh. I would buy it again."
1.00,"I just bought this toothpaste yesterday and to repeat what everyone else has already said, it causing mouth peeling and now I'm just scared about what will happen throughout the rest of the day!I used it last night for the first time and within minutes after brushing noticed the mouth peeling. I couldn't be 100% sure it was the toothpaste that caused it until my second use... I was in a hurry this morning so I brought my toothbrush and toothpaste to work with me as I do often. I got to work, finished my coffee and went into the bathroom to brush my teeth. By the time I walked down the hall from the bathroom to my desk, the inside of my mouth began peeling again. I am not using it again and just wrote to Crest DEMANDING my money back and sending them a link to this Amazon page with the other reviews of this disgusting product. Now that I see that other people also discovered mouth pain and gum deterioration, I'm scared about what will happen throughout the rest of the day now, just having used it on my mouth! As I'm typing this I am noticing my back molars are starting to pulse with a dull pain.I'm going to rinse my mouth out thoroughly with water to try and get this stuff out of my mouth.If anyone knows of a good, SAFE enamel shield toothpaste they'd like to recommend, please let me know!"
1.00,"good for soaking your toothbrushes in overnight and that is it. product not good for human ingestiion."
5.00,"Good flavor, great clean feel afterward! And above all...your mouth doesn't feel like you're rinsing with acid."
4.00,"The product felt very fresh and totally clean. My mouth felt great after using! Use it daily and will continue to buy."
2.00,"I've used Crest toothpaste for as long as I can remember. Sure, I've tried other brands occasionally, but always returned to Crest as soon as the competing brand's tube was finished. I have found Crest toothpaste to be both effective and pleasant-tasting. When I saw the Crest Pro-Health Clean Mint Toothpaste, it seemed a no-brainer to upgrade to this newest Crest formula. Promoted by Crest as providing six different benefits: cavities, gingivitis, plaque, whitening, sensitivity, and bad breath, I couldn't imagine where this toothpaste would go wrong, given my past experience with the brand. Where this toothpaste goes wrong is in the flavor. While I can force myself to brush with it, the taste is decidedly unpleasant to me. I can't quite describe what is wrong other than to say it is somewhat reminiscent of the flavors one experiences during a trip to the dentist. Perhaps the \"Therapeutic Stannous Fluoride\" in it is just too strong for me or maybe it is the \"Sodium Hexametaphospahte\" I find unpalatable. I really don't know and I don't care. I do know I won't be using this toothpaste anymore. If you can get past the flavor, this toothpaste really does clean well, but that flavor is such a huge turn-off for me that I won't be able to use it long enough to determine the long-term effectiveness of this formula. I will go back to , which is pleasant enough that I look forward to brushing my teeth. Perhaps the Pro-Health formula might taste OK to others, but it doesn't suit me at all. I should note that I did not experience any issues with lip peeling or sores, etc. but only used it a couple of days because of the bad taste."
3.00,"I didnt like the taste of the toothpaste that much and I feel there is residual left in my mouth which is hard to rinse off."
5.00,"Been using this rinse for a while now but couldn't find it in the store over the last week so ordered it on Amazon the only problem i have is the price is very high for such a tiny bottle as i used to pay half the price for a bottle three times as big."
4.00,"My husband loved the mouthwash. He said it kept his mouth fresh all day."
5.00,"Our pediatric dentist recommended a kid-friendly flavored mouthwash (Act Spongebob kind) to use once a day when our twins were about 3 years old.  We used it for almost 2 years until the blueberry fruity scent of their breath was just not cutting it.  They have beautiful teeth, but there is no substitute for a mint mouthwash for anyone.  The very first time they used the Crest Pro Health for me mouthwash, they both whined that it was \"hot\" or \"burns\".  We kept at it twice a day, everyday, and now they will not use anything else, their choice.  It makes sense that it says age 8 and up because all little kids seem to hate regular adult toothpaste claiming it is \"hot\".  Maybe if I'd waited 3 more years to try it, they wouldn't have whined the first couple times, but because they love it now, it's totally worth it.  They swish for a solid 45 seconds and spit, and they just turned 5 recently.  I would highly recommend this to target the awful little kid morning breath!!"
5.00,"My teeth feel so clean. This will be my only toothpaste."
5.00,"This toothpaste is perfect, even for sensitive teeth."
4.00,"Everyone may thing toothpaste is nothing but toothpaste. However, the Crest Pro-Health last longer, which will leave your mouth feeling clean for longer. You get what you pay for!"
5.00,"I could rinse in the a.m. and go all day feeling very fresh and clean. It is a bit pricier than most but I think well worth the extra cost. Crest has been around since I was a kid. I've yet to even try a different brand..it truly is...tried and true:)"
5.00,"Good toothpaste. I highly recommend it! It's a good product and it seems to do what it promises to do."
5.00,"We use mouthwash in our home all the time, and always have a bottle of it sitting on the bathroom sink. We bounce back and forth all the time between different versions of Scope and Crest, depending on what's on sale or what new version has come out. I'm more of a wimp when it comes to the mouthwash \"burn\" than my husband is. He likes his Scope, I tend to prefer Crest versions because of the removal of alcohol from their formulas. While I've always been a fan of the that I have used for years, and has peroxide in it to help with whitening, sometimes I want something without the peroxide bubbles. That's where this Crest Pro-Health Smooth Mint version comes in.It's name \"Smooth Mint\" is spot on. The removal of the alcohol takes away the painful mouthwash burn. I appreciate this since the Scope versions burn so much, I can hardly use them for more than a few seconds. I can rinse my mouth with this Crest Pro-Health for the full suggested length of time, and it leaved my mouth feeling clean and my breath smelling great. It has a long lasting effect, but not so much that I have any problems with an unpleasant aftertaste. Just feels clean. Sometimes the simpler versions of mouthwash, like this one, end up being the best."
1.00,"After using this toothpaste, I developed a sore on my tongue, then it spread to the inside of my cheeks. It was very painful and felt like I had burned the inside of my mouth. I thought I had somehow developed thrush, which is strange for an adult. I went to the doctor, she thought maybe I had burned my mouth too. I still didn't connect it with this toothpaste. I just knew that the toothpaste didn't help the soreness. In fact, for a while I couldn't use any of my regular toothpastes except for a natural one with no fluoride. It took at least two weeks for my mouth to start getting better. About a month later, I used this toothpaste again. Same thing happened, this time I made the connection. The people writing the other reviews are right. This toothpaste caused chemical burns in my mouth. I can't understand why it isn't doing that to everyone who uses it. Makes me wonder if there has been some tampering at the plant? I have never before had trouble with any other Crest product. I will be contacting them about this."
5.00,"This toothpaste works really good! My favorite brand of toothpaste is Crest!"
5.00,"I purchased the Pro Health Plaque toothpaste for my kids to use. Kids don't always brush well so I feel much better about my kids when they brush with this toothpaste. It has many features that keep their teeth healthy looking and feeling great. And my kids healthy teeth keep this mom happy!"
4.00,"I was pleased with how clean my teeth felt. After some brands that I have tried my teeth didn't feel completly clean. It cleaned very well without being overly minty."
1.00,"Just imagine my frustration when I finally make a real effort to increase my dental hygiene by adding flossing and crest pro health mouthwash twice a day to my routine-- which already includes using a sonicare toothbrush-- and now I have stubborn brown stains in between all of my bottom teeth. When I read the warning on the bottle that \"staining may occur\" I had no idea that it would be like this! I thought maybe a tinge of blue, but brown crud?? And it does not brush off. I only hope that my dentist can remove it. Until then, the rest of my Crest Pro Health has been dumped down the drain. I know this has been reported in MANY other reviews, but I thought adding my story will send a stronger message to the manufacturer that this is not a rare occurrence, and BUYER BEWARE! The lack of alcohol burn is nice, but brown teeth is too much of a price to pay."
1.00,"... that a product like this is still on the market. I used it for the first time at night and woke up like I had visited the dentist from hell; as if a dental hygienist had flossed me way to hard. That turned into sensitive teeth all around and down to the roots, accompanied by a horrible metallic taste in my mouth... which I later realized was caused from my own bleeding gums."
4.00,"My teeth feel dentist clean every day! Can't wait to go to the dentist to see what they think!"
4.00,"Great product love the clean feeling and fresh breath"
5.00,"Great taste. It actually does whiten my teeth. I have a bit of sensitive teeth, and this product doesn't cause sensitivity like some whitening products do."
4.00,"This reminds me of some of the old fashioned brands that I don't see anymore. Namely, the alcohol content is something I'd not seen in such a strong dosage for many years. Definitely it kills germs and works but not everybody is going to like the feel.Also, the color is quite strong. That means it's probably infused with too much dye, an unnecessary feature. Still, it surely kills bacteria."
5.00,"was better than I thought it would be. left my teeth feeling so clean. Glad I made the purchase"
3.00,"I didn't find anything extraordinary about this. It's toothpaste. It worked as well as every other toothpaste. There was nothing about it that really made it stand out. It didn't seem to do anything extra."
4.00,"I liked the Crest Pro Health toothpaste for plaque control. It left my mouth feeling really clean but the feeling did not last too long."
3.00,"Knocked my morning breath right out and made my mouth feel clean"
5.00,"I have sensitive teeth and this did not bother me! It cleans well without irritating - a plus!"
5.00,"I do think that my teeth maintain the just from the dentist feeling using this product."
5.00,"When using this tooth paste, my teeth feel like I just left the dentist office after having my teeth cleaned by the hygienist."
5.00,"I was hesitant to try the toothpaste. I am so glad I did! It truly does what it promises. I have noticed a decrease in plaque build up. My teeth feel wonderful after brushing. My mouth is refreshed."
5.00,"This is a fantastic product that leaves your mouth feeling fresh & clean. Retail value is a little high compared to other similar products on the shelf, but in my opinion the extra few bucks is well worth it!"
4.00,"My family really like the clean fresh feeling after using Crest ProHealth."
4.00,"My husband & I really like this product. Especially how clean your mouth feels. The only downside is the taste, just a little too chemical-tasting."
4.00,"I tried the whole prohealth line and in just a day you can feel the difference. Even as a coffee drinker your teeth feel great and clean all day."
2.00,"This toothpaste has good consistency as Crest usually does. However, it leave a strange taste in the mouth and after taste that is not good. I'm not sure if it's the Pro-Health part of it or the Whitening part of it, but I would not pay for the Pro-Health Whitening mint gel toothpaste, and would recommend a different type."
1.00,"My dentist gave me a sample of this mouthwash, so I used it twice. This was followed by a weekend of very bland food. This stuff killed my sense of taste. Refunds can be given for a bad product, but I want my taste back!"
5.00,"This is a great toothpaste. I'll buy it again in the future!!"
5.00,"Loved the new crest! Long lasting freshness--great tasting!"
5.00,"This toothpaste makes my teeth feel so smooth & clean! It's my favorite."
4.00,"I really liked using this toothpaste, it makes your teeth feel clean and your breath fresh. It foams up nicely too so you definitely get that clean mouth feeling. Crest is definitely my favorite brand toothpaste."
5.00,"this product is great. I will contuine to use this toothpast. It gives you a fresh feeling while brushing"
5.00,"I loved it! Tasted wonderful and works great! I would totally recommend it to my friends!"
5.00,"This product leaves your moth minty fresh!!! The sample is perfect to carry in my makeup bag! Great!!"
4.00,"I really liked this product and could tell a difference in a short time frame. I would recommend it to anyone to try."
5.00,"Crest Whitestrips were quick and easy to use. I could tell they were effective right away!"
5.00,"I love a fresh clean feeling and I get it with crest..."
5.00,"I tried the Crest Pro-Health Clinical mouthwash, and loved it! It didn't have the burning sensation because it doesn't have alcohol in it. I also noticed that my gums seemed to be in better condition after using it for approx. 2 weeks. It foams up when you swish with it. Overall, I loved it!"
5.00,"I loved it! This toothpaste had a pleasant minty flavor that wasn't overwhelming. I usually brush for two full minutes and I really felt that the toothpaste did an excellent job of cleaning my teeth and freshened my mouth. I highly recommend this!"
5.00,"I love the toothpaste, it leaves you with such a fresh and clean breathe. Just such a smooth feeling. Thanks Crest!"
5.00,"I love this toothpaste, and have a hard time finding it in the stores now. It really makes a difference when I wake up in the morning. My teeth still feel clean, and I have noticed much less \"morning breath\". Hope they don't discontinue it!"
4.00,"Made my mouth feel fresh for a long time. Nice product."
5.00,"I love Crest Pro-Health toothpaste. It's my toothpaste of choice. I really like the taste compared to other brands and how clean it makes my mouth feel. I really like the Clean Mint flavor too. I've used Crest Pro-health without any issues. It's a good all-around toothpaste and I feel confident it's taking care of my teeth and making my breath fresh at the same time."
5.00,"Great product, clean feel. Will use this every day."
5.00,"we loved this toothpaste my husband won't let me buy any other type now."
4.00,"I usually use the Crest Pro Health Whitening toothpaste, when I got to use this one I could really tell it was more um for cleaning and less for taste. The fluoride is really high, and I wasn't crazy about that...but I do have rather healthy teeth and gums...so maybe being used by a person with higher plaque buildup I can see how this would really be a beneficial toothpaste."
5.00,"Best toothpaste I've ever used - it's \"grittier\" than the mint version, which manages to give my teeth a \"just been to the dentist\" \"sand-blasted\" super-clean feel all year round."
5.00,"The Pro Health Night Time toothpaste did make my mouth feel cleaner in the morning. I am pleasantly surprised."
3.00,"I find it a little disingenuous that Crest markets this to people over 50, when it has the exact same active ingredient (and percentage of it) as the other Crest mouthwashes I've used. As someone who is under age 50, I figured I'd give this a try to see if I notice any differences, and I did not. I think the \"50 and over\" thing is nothing more than a gimmick on Crest's part. That said, the mouthwash seems to work fine, and the flavor isn't bad. I make sure to rinse with water after rinsing with it, and doing that ensures I don't have too much of a lingering aftertaste (it still does linger a little bit, though). Overall, it's not a bad product--I just don't think it should be marketed specifically at a certain age range without a better explanation or different active ingredient than other Crest products."
5.00,"I was not disappointed. It is very good and the family loves."
5.00,"The crest pro-health toothpaste gives such a clean feeling and makes your mouth feel like it has a minty flavor that lasts. I love this product."
5.00,"I have been using this toothpaste for a while now. I love it. My teeth have never felt or looked better. I have even had comments on the looks of my teeth. Thank you so much for a great product ! ! My friends are now trying it."
5.00,"I've been using this product for years, and it has healed my gums, and made my teeth more stable. I put it on an interdent brush, and clean between my teeth, then rinse with it; it has worked wonders!"
4.00,"I like the way my mouth is refreshed by this product. It makes me feel clean and just out of the dentist chair."
5.00,"Glide floss is my favorite, easy to use .Doesn't shred like other floss."
1.00,"I just tried Crest Pro-Health mouthwash for the first time without knowing about its extensive history of consumer complaints.I am a \"clean freak\" when it comes to my teeth, so it took me as a shock when my gums and inside of my cheeks started burning immediately after trying this product (I can use regular Listerine without even flinching). I was also puzzled by the dark green pieces of what looked like shavings from a pencil eraser when I spit it out. The burning persisted for a few hours and went away but my food tasted funny all day.Now, after having used this product twice a day for four days, there is consistent pain and slight swelling on the inside of both cheeks along with a throbbing pain in my lower left jaw. I stopped using it and went back to my usual mouthwash this morning but decided to check online to see if there are any complaints about the Crest Pro-Health mouthwash. WOW! I can't believe it is still being sold because there are literally thousands of complaints out there about similar pain and/or brown staining of the teeth (which I luckily didn't experience).Please do not buy this product unless you have been using it for a while and aren't bothered by it. I don't know why it is still on the market with so many complaints."
2.00,"This product may work good but forcing myself to use it is a problem. The taste is terrible, and when using it, it foams up in chunks in the mouth. I would still use it if was the only mouthwash in the house but I'd be better off buying something else."
4.00,"This is a toothpaste with a lot of claims, but the one I was hoping for was helping with sensitivity. Perhaps, but even on the tube it says\" \"Do not use for sensitivity longer than four weeks unless recommended by a dentist.\" It doesn't say like my Sensodyne to see the dentist if the problem persists for four weeks. Nonetheless, my dentist has handed me out samples of Crest and the toothpaste has proven to be a good one. Just don't count on it being another Sensodyne because it just plain isn't. The active antihypersensitivity ingredient, potassium nitrate, isn't listed. The taste of the gel is a nice heavy minty one that left my mouth feeling clean and refreshed. It's a bit heavier mint taste than the \"regular\" Crest, but quite nice. If you want to stock up, the expiration date is good at more than a year off. I do appreciate products that aren't set to expire a month after purchase. Many of the Crest products are now Amazon Add-ons, a real plus if you don't need or want large quantities. Crest Pro-Health: ~ Fights cavities ~ Whitens teeth ~ Fights sensitivity ~ Fights gingivitis ~ Fights tartar ~ Freshens breath ~ Fights plaque ACTIVE INGREDIENT: Stannous floride 0.454% (0.16 w/v fluoride ion) INACTIVE INGREDIENTS: Glycerin, hydrated silica, sodium hexametaphosphate, proplene glycol, PEG-6, water, zinc lactate, trisodium phosphate, flavor, sodium lauryl sulfate, sodium gluconate, carrageenan, sodium saccharin, polyethylene, xanthan gum, titanium dioxide, blue 1"
4.00,"This mouthwash keeps my mouth feeling clean all day."
5.00,"I have been very pleased with this product, I use the toothpaste and mouth rinse. Both products have a nice fresh taste, but it is not strong, harsh, nor burning, which I like. I was really surprised by how long the fresh clean feeling lasted considering the mildness of the flavor. I am a smoker and my mouth still feels clean and fresh for a while, even after smoking. The only con for me is the cost, it is a bit more than what I would like to spend."
5.00,"No crazy intenseness. Just does the job without drama. Another great product from Crest!"
5.00,"I loved this product and will continue to use it. It leaves a fresh, clean feeling."
5.00,"All of the Crest pro health products are great. The results of their use is obvious after the first few uses. My dentist has said that these Crest products will put him out of business!"
4.00,"But not so great taste. Oh well, you can't have it all. I buy this regularly, but it does not whiten. Would love it if they added whitener to this."
5.00,"I was so excited to try these products and I have to say, I LOVE them! They def. make my teeth look and feel cleaner longer!"
5.00,"I loved the Crest Pro-Health Clinical mouthwash. It was a refreshing flavor. Also, the mouthwash was not overwhelmingly strong. It tasted great!"
5.00,"I have a problem with plaque. This toothpaste has helped me keep it under control."
5.00,"I am over 60 and do anything I can to keep my teeth as healthy as possible..when I saw the ad for this 'over 50' toothpaste I looked for it in our local stores..not on shelves..came to Amazon and success..quick delivery!..love it.."
5.00,"I love the clean feeling my teeth have after every time I brush. They actually feel like I was just at the Dentist Office. The flavors are great and do not feel too harsh, so I can brush my teeth and still taste things afterwards."
4.00,"As a child, I really was not taught about dental hygiene. Thus as an adult, I'm trying to keep what natural teeth I have, and I know gum health is very important. I like this rinse very much because of several reasons: it's alcohol free; it has a pleasant taste and feel in the mouth - it's not harsh and it kind of foams when I swish it around; appreciate what it says it does for the gums."
5.00,"Tried the Crest Clinical Rinse and it has a very fresh feeling that lasted a long time. It's my favorite now!"
4.00,"Loved the taste and the after taste also the way it made my mouth feel"
4.00,"I was surprised that I liked this product so much. I love that it didn't burn that much and that it worked with everything else to whiten my teeth."
3.00,"This Crest toothpaste is probably the strongest mint toothpaste I have ever used. It is a wonder that something this strong says it is for sensitive teeth. I do have one tooth that is sensitive and this did not bother it. The strength of the mint lingered for a long time, much like a strong mouthwash does. One complaint against this is that it is so hard to squeeze out of the tube. It does have a flat cap which means you can stand it up rather than having it lie flat on your shelf taking up so much room. One would think that that would allow the toothpaste to move towards the opening, but it does not. You cannot rollup the tube either, since it is made of a thicker plastic than many tubes. You just wind up having to press it flat in order to empty the contents as it gets lower. If you want a strong tasting toothpaste that is designed to prevent gingivitis - this would be for you; however if you prefer a more gentle toothpaste look elsewhere."
5.00,"I LOVE that Crest has come out with a new toothpaste to help kids bridge from fruity flavored toothpaste to a more minty variety. My kids claim it's still \"too hot\" for their mouths, but they have gradually made the switch and don't notice it any more. It is minty but without the \"bite\" of adult toothpaste. This is our new go to paste for my three children under 10."
4.00,"After trying several toothpastes including prescription ones, I thought this paste was good especially for the price."
5.00,"It is the perfect fit for me! Keep sending new products for me to try! Thanks!"
5.00,"I love the texture and feel of this toothpaste. Your teeth feel very clean after brushing. I like the more subtle flavors - not the mouth-burning mint like some toothpastes!"
4.00,"This is for sure one of the best toothpaste products that I have used in a long time. The quality is obvious. My mouth feels clean after I use this toothpaste, much like when I return from the dentist."
4.00,"I enjoy brushing with this product at night - leaves my teeth & mouth feeling very clean and fresh."
5.00,"I love how it leaves my teeth feeling clean but it's expensive just for toothpaste."
5.00,"Loved this product. well worth it and I will be purchasing again soon."
5.00,"Super result. Really love this toothpaste. Leaves teeth very clean."
5.00,"My teeth and mouth felt so clean just after my first brushing with the new Crest. I liked it so much that I shared it with my Granddaughter. It left us feeling very confident that our teeth were shiny clean and breath very fresh. Thank you so much Crest! Your products are the only ones found in this household."
5.00,"alcohol free what can beat that. refreshing taste and cleaner teeth defenetly would buy it again"
4.00,"So it's supposed to be clinical strength, so if I have a fabulous dental check up next time, I think it will be worth the extra couple of dollars. I personally thought it had a pleasant taste, my fiance hates the taste."
5.00,"I love Crest prohealth products I just wish they were cheaper because I would buy them more. i recommend them if you can afford them!"
1.00,"After using only 1/2 of a bottle of this horrible concoction, every tooth was stained, and I had to have my teeth cleaned with a baking soda blaster at the dentist's office. I will never again buy any Proctor & Gamble product."
5.00,"Always been a fan of Crest toothpaste. Tried the Pro Health rinse. It really freshens your mouth and has kept that fresh from the dentist feel for a while. I highly recommend this product - over the \"other\" mouthwash that starts with an L."
2.00,"I originally used this to stop a sensitive tooth, but a few days after I started to use it on a regular basis I developed a super ichy rash on my forearms. The rash went away as soon as I stopped using the toothpaste. I am allergic to the type of floride they use in this product. The tooth sensitivity did go away, but the rash was really unpleasant."
5.00,"Crest is the only toothpaste of my household and has been for over 20 years. The toothpaste was awesome. Great tasting and left my teeth feeling clean and fresh."
5.00,"Love this toothpaste, been using it since it came out."
4.00,"For some reason here where I live you cannot get cinnamon products at all. I would of liked to see a two pack shipping."
5.00,"Crest has always been my product of Choice. Just keep those great products coming. I love this new Pro Choice. I'm sold!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5.00,"We all liked the non-overwhelming mint flavor, and feel fresh when we use it."
5.00,"Best product ever. I recommend it to anyone. You won't regret it. Go for it. Thank You Crest co. I love it."
5.00,"Never heard of this toothpaste until a deal came along. DD said the kids like and use it and it is an enticement to get them to brush! Can't beat that and the price was right too. Now we and they are all happy!"
5.00,"i like it to much is excellent brand i feel my theets mores clean"
1.00,"I have been using this for about a week, which may not be long enough to fairly judge this product, but so far all I can say is that it effectively cleans my teeth. The other stuff it does, like whitening, preventing gum disease....well, who knows? I drink coffee and eat acidic foods daily, and I have other mouth hygiene routines even before using this product that help prevent gum disease and tarter build up that I can't say that this product is doing those things. The flavor is the typical mint, and the paste has a vaguely gritty texture. I find the after taste minorly unpleasant in terms of the mintyness. But it cleans my teeth, and I suppose that is what you want when you brush your teeth. But am I believer in the other benefits of this toothpaste? Not yet. So far I see myself sticking with my typical brand. UPDATE 6/18/2013 Just visited my dentist after using this brand for a few months. It was my worst appointment in years. I've changed absolutely nothing BUT my toothpaste. I had more plaque build-up, some swollen gum tissue, and was told to get back to my previous brushing habits. After telling my dentist that nothing was different except for the paste, he just reiterated that I needed to do better. I take pride in having clean teeth and needing very little scraping/picking/etc during a cleaning (my mom really got it stuck in my head that I wanted to die with my teeth in my head, I took her seriously). It was definitely a WTH moment. Changing my star rating from a 3 to a 1. UPDATE 1/15/14 Had another dentist visit just 2 weeks ago for routine cleaning. As noted in the previous update, things were not what I was hoping, and immediately switched back to Colgate Sensitive Enamel Protect Toothpaste, 6.0-Ounce Packages (Pack of 4). And had my traditional PERFECT cleaning. No warnings to \"do better\" with brushing and flossing. Again, the only difference was the toothpaste. I've not changed my floss brand or toothbrush type. I can only conclude that the Crest was the culprit!"
5.00,"Love this toothpaste! My teeth felt cleaner when I use this. Loved the flavor."
1.00,"I bought this product a few weeks ago and began noticing a slimy, white residue from skin cells/skin soon after brushing. I have never had this issue before and have excellent dental hygiene. This doesn't seem safe and I have stopped using this product altogether. Do not buy unless you want a chemical burn!"
5.00,"Loved the toothepaste. It made my mouth feel cleaner."
3.00,"I wouldn't use this product. It is too much work. I think flossing and brushing are fine."
2.00,"I gave this toothpaste two stars only because it does clean your mouth, but also creates mouth slime galore! I had been using the toothpaste for about two months. About a month ago, I noticed I started getting this slimy substance inside my mouth. It would occur all day long, and I could gather/pull out huge gobs of slime!!! It was embarrassing. The inside of my mouth never hurt. No sores of any kind, just alot of white slime. One day my fiance noticed some on the outside corner of my mouth that had somehow escaped from the inside! That's when I realized I needed to research the cause. I was worried it might be thrush or something serious, but didn't think so because I didn't have any pain or sores. I'm not on any medication, so I knew it couldn't be the result of a side effect. Searching the internet I found lots of people with the same condition, and we all had something in common. We used Crest Pro Health toothpaste!!! Interestingly enough, my fiance uses it also and has never had a problem with it. But I'm going to stop using it immediately, and see what happens. I have to assume this is the cause since it only started after I changed from my old toothpaste (Aquafresh) to Crest Pro Health."
1.00,"I've been using Crest Pro-Health toothpaste for a few weeks now. I've never had issues with brown spots like some people seem to have, but my husband has (he apparently just thought his teeth needed to be cleaned!), and I have had some others. For a while now I've been having a throbbing sensation in my gums and teeth that I thought was due to unknowingly clenching my teeth... on a whim today I decided to do some research to see if it could possibly be related to the toothpaste, and to my surprise, quite a few other people are having a similar experience. I've also had the nasty stringy/mucousy stuff, though that's not as bad when I rinse my mouth well with water afterward. I'm throwing this stuff away tonight... they ought to take it off the market."
4.00,"I liked this mouth rinse, because it wasn't as intense as Listerine (which I hate!), it had a foamy, less-intense burning feeling, and my mouth felt clean."
4.00,"My mom bought it for me. I am 10. The cap is very difficult to open. Every time would use it, I would have to try many times until I can open it. Sometime I have to ask my mom for help, but she is getting annoyed now."
5.00,"I feel refreshed and clean when I use this rinse and will be buying it again. I think it will help prevent cavities and decay."
5.00,"I really like this product. Not only does it leave my mouth feeling really clean/fresh, but here's the BIG thing: I waiting to review this product until after my 6 month dental cleaning. I normally have a lot of plaque build-up, but this time it only took the hygenist 1/2 the time to clean my teeth! Amazing!"
4.00,"I figured all toothpastes were the same but I was very impressed by the Crest Pro Health. I didn't really notice a huge difference right away; it was the fact that my teeth felt clean for much longer. Even after drinking coffee and eating, my teeth still felt clean. I will definitely be using this toothpaste in the future."
5.00,"Crest Pro Health Rinse was a great way of knowing that I was keeping my mouth and teeth healthy. It is a rinse with multiple benefits from fighting gingivitis to freshening my breath."
5.00,"My mouth stayed feeling fresh and minty for hours. I will definitely buy again!!"
5.00,"I have sensitive teeth and this product did not bother my teeth!"
5.00,"left my teeth fresh and clean all day even after drinking coffee and eating lunch"
5.00,"I like this toothpaste. Too bad they quit making it! It was great for brushing before bedtime & gave my mouth a clean feeling."
5.00,"I love Crest toothpaste and this one did not disappoint!"
4.00,"Crest pro health oral product line is excellent. Suggest you try out all varieties and find out which works for each individual in your household. I prefer the 50+ product line. And my sibling prefers sensitive gums choice. Either way these products are for good dental care and they work."
3.00,"I would prefer a more minty, foamy taste in my mouth."
5.00,"This Crest Pro-health line of toothpaste does a great job of cleaning off the daily coffee and tea stains, and leaving teeth feeling very smooth. It's strong flavor keeps breath fresh for quite a while, as though you had used mouthwash. I've not run into any problems with it causing issues in my mouth and it seems to work just as well as most other versions of Crest toothpaste. I drink a lot of hot tea every day which can cause staining if I don't use a toothpaste like this Crest Pro-Health that has scrubbing crystals in them that provide some daily whitening of my teeth. It's a great basic toothpaste with a traditional mint taste."
5.00,"Crest Clinical Strength mouth wash worked all day long. I highly recommend this to friends and family who want the all day fresh feeling. :0)"
5.00,"I love this stuff. My teeth feel super clean. Wish they would have kept it going. Even my kids like it."
4.00,"I love Crest products. The toothpaste worked much better than other toothpaste I have tried. I also tried the mouthwash and loved it. Crest is a brand that I know and love and have used for years. The toothpaste kept my teeth clean for hours even after eating and drinking which is good. The stregnth of the toothpaste was also good knowing that it was for clinical health and keeping my teeth clean and strong was great. Crest always has a great line of products that are for everybody. Great products!!!"
5.00,"I tried this product and is true to form for Crest. It worked incredibly well and left my teeth and mouth feeling very clean and fresh."
5.00,"This toothpaste is by far my favorite. I have read other reviews ab the packaging and i have not experienced a problem with it at all. The toothpaste is wonderful and the taste is amazing, I would recomend to anyone that asked. I never want to stop brushing my teeth once i start. This product is amazing!"
5.00,"After using the Crest Clinical I was very surprised that it really cut down on the plaque on my teeth. I had the quickest cleaning I have ever had. Very awesome product! I will continue to use it."
1.00,"Firstly, I will state that I do not drink carbonated beverages, coffee, wine, or even much tea (all known teeth stainers). I brush my teeth 2-3x per day and have never had a cavity. However when I started using this toothpaste after about 1 1/2 months my teeth now have turned brown. I have never had brown teeth before, and other than starting to use this toothpaste I have done nothing different with my teeth which leads me to believe it is the culprit. I called crest directly and though they were very polite they informed me that while not common this does happen for whatever reason to some peoples teeth. Bottom line while it leaves your mouth feeling clean, it leaves your teeth looking gross--I recommend being very cautous when using this product. I would recommend however Crest's 3D whitening toothpaste, this seems to be working well and is removing some of the Pro Health stains."
3.00,"I was not so fond of the taste of this product. It does leave my teeth clean, but not so fresh."
5.00,"This mouthwash left my mouth feeling fresh and clean and lasted longer than most other mouthwashes. I'd recommend it to everyone!"
5.00,"This toothpaste has become one of my husbands favorites. He tried it and he could really tell a difference in his teeth as well as his breath after using it. He highly recommends it and it may become a house favorite."
4.00,"I am trying to step up my oral care routine and this was a great addition!"
4.00,"This toothpaste (tp) is like a 7 course meal in that it is everything you could want a tp to be, only not everyday. Some of the extras offered in tp actually harm your teeth when used long term, like the abrasives (baking soda), bleaches (hydrogen peroxide), etc. One of my friends had a relative who used heavy baking soda tp. After years of doing that, the polish was stripped off her teeth. Not a good situation. I love the Crest brand and want the benefits of a 7 course meal so I use Crest Pro Health once every two weeks. Moderation is the best policy with the all in one tps."
4.00,"This is definitely better than average toothpaste. Not my favorite, but I do like it. Leaves my mouth fresh, but I didn't like the texture or flavor as much as I would have liked to."
5.00,"Very clean feeling, Love the taste, Very refreshing. Thank you."
4.00,"I thought this mouth wash was pretty good. Helped with my boyfriends bad breath! Was a little different with the foamy feeling. I would recommend for others but we will stick with Pro-Health!"
1.00,"Warning!! I bought this product yesterday and tried it in the morning. I used fairly moderate amount, less than the instruction I believe, because it was my first try of this product. Now my mouth is still numb and dry. I feel like my taste buds are all destroyed as my tongue was burnt by drinking a lot of very hot water. Also, i lost the ability to taste...so sad! I just ate one of my favorite chocolate and it didn't taste as good as usual. It makes me unable to taste sweet, and sour become bitter taste ( I drank juice and it's all bitterness).I will throw the product in the trash when I get home today! This is just another version of their pro health multi protection mouthwash. But not any better. I seriously don't understand why the company hasn't take this product off their line now!! with so many complaints!!"
2.00,"This Crest Pro-Health Clean Mint is very much like the Crest Pro-Health Gum Protection except for a few of the chemical ingredients are re-ordered, and the flavor. While the Gum Protection is fiercely minty, the Clean Mint is mild enough that my son doesn't mind the flavor. Back to Chemicals -- one difference is that the order of Sodium Laurel Sulfate and Sodium Sulfate in the list of ingredients is reversed. There are other switches, but given that they are way low on the list I doubt it makes a significant difference in effectiveness. We won't be buying more of this because the many 1-Star reviews seem to indicate that there is a quality control problem with this particular product."
4.00,"I enjoyed using this product as it made my mouth feel fresh and clean!"
5.00,"I really liked this product. My teeth felt smooth like they do after you've been to the Dentists office."
5.00,"I was not a mouth wash person before this product! Amazing. My mouth feels so fresh and clean after using this product."
3.00,"I'm not sure why Crest put this kit together. You would not use up the components at the same time, so the first time you buy it together would be the last. It would make more sense to me for these to have been travel-size products. But the toothpaste is a big tube (bigger than I usually buy), and the mouthwash is an ENORMOUS one-liter bottle. It's hard to handle and takes up a lot of room. This kit would make no sense as a gift, even for a college student. However, some of the individual products are good. MOUTHWASH: I was already using the mouthwash, and I love it (I have a much smaller, easy-to-hold bottle, so I'll refill it from this economy size, something that I already did). Long ago, I used Listerine, and that kept my gums in good shape, but yeah, it stung and tasted bad. I switched to Crest as soon as it hit the market, and I've never had gingivitis, so I guess it must be working. It has a pleasant taste and definitely prevents bad breath. I wouldn't think of starting or ending the day without it. Five stars! TOOTHPASTE: I was already using the sensitive-teeth variety of Pro-Health, and I like it a lot (it tastes much better than the corresponding version of Colgate). This variety tastes good, so I'll use it for a while. But if my sensitivity returns, I'll have to switch back. This is one of the problems with having a kit (you can't customize for individual preferences). Four stars. FLOSS: I was currently using Colgate's Precision floss, which I've happily used for years. It goes between my teeth much easier than this Glide does. But this Glide is wider, so maybe it provides better plaque and debris removal. But frictiony floss tends to make my mouth ache, so I'm going to stick with my Colgate Precision. I'd give this Glide floss three stars (but if you don't have snug teeth, you might rate it much higher). TOOTHBRUSH: This is an impressive-looking brush, but the bristles are just too aggressive and firm for me. I've gotta think this can't be good for your gums (my dentist told me that most people, including me, have some degree of gum recession from too aggressive brushing with too harsh of bristles). I'm currently using a Sonic toothbrush, but when I use a manual, I prefer Colgate's Reach brand in a soft variety. I tried this Crest Oral-B, but I found it to be uncomfortable. 1 star. In summary, I like Crest's Pro-Health mouthwash and toothpastes, but I don't care for the other products. And why they put these products together in these sizes is just a head-scratcher."
5.00,"Our family only uses Crest products. I purchased the pro-health toothpaste previously and it was not a favorite. So, I purchased the rinse with some doubts. I absolutely LOVE it. my mouth does feel cleaner and there is no burn. I have recommended this product to all of my co-workers."
5.00,"Loved the way it made my teeth feel. I will be buying this toothpaste again; I think for what it does the cost is good. Crest Pro-Health is now my toothpaste!"
1.00,"I finally got sick and tired of the goopy mess this product made as it constantly oozed out of the tube because the lid doesn't close properly. I called CREST and complained and the customer representative assured me their products go through \"extensive testing\". Hmmm, somehow this one must have slipped through quality control because it's obvious that the goop inside easily finds its way out of the tube and onto your bathroom counters and from there it gets on everything else in the general area! Sometimes I think it must be alive... What a horrible mess this product by CREST makes. Can't say much about what it does for the teeth because most of it winds up on the counter. Sorry CREST, but this product is horrible."
5.00,"This is a great product. I'll buy it for my family again."
4.00,"What a great product at a great price. I set this up on Subscribe and Save and it is so very worth it."
3.00,"The mouthwash is good, we use it all the time, it works good and has some added benefit of not only providing fresher breath it is to be good for your teeth too and help them to not develop cavities. The toothpaste has a great flavor, my husband is using it, I did try it and I like it, but I need the sensitive type of toothpaste. The glide floss is good, it does go between teeth easily and I have used this before but I found that it leaves too much tarter behind because the dentist had a lot more to clean the last visit after using glide for quite a while so I guess it doesn't clean the junk off enough. The toothbrush to me is much too big and too harsh, I don't like it at all. When I do use a manual toothbrush I use the softest bristles and I like mine a little smaller than this. Of course everyone has their own tastes. I am not sure why these are bundled together like this, I would prefer to buy them separately myself so that I can get the variety I want. They are good products though, the mouthwash and toothpaste are great, results may vary with the floss and brush though."
5.00,"This is a very nice collection. Ultimately it should come down to cost for you, if it makes sense to buy these items as a group. It might be that you only need one or two of the items. I'll use the review to comment on the floss. Absolutely first-rate. So well worth the extra expense. This gets where it needs to go, including tight gaps, without pain and without tearing/shredding. Best floss I have ever used."
5.00,"I purchased this product and have been using it for 2 weeks now. I have really noticed a difference in how my teeth look and how my mouth feels. The taste is clean and refreshing and my mouth feels clean for hours. My teeth look and feel noticeably different. I am hooked on this product and will continue to purchase."
4.00,"Nice fresh taste after brushing, no grit left behind. I would buy it again!!"
5.00,"I love the way this product made my teeth and mouth feel! Although the price is a little more than I would typically spend without knowing the quality of the product, it is well worth the price. I will definitely buy this product in the future!"
3.00,"My wife has irritation from just about any toothepase, and I was hopeful that this toothpaste would be more \"gentle\" than others, since it is for ages 50+. After all, it does not have peroxide. Still, she tried it for a few days and felt that it was just as riirtating on her gums as most others. Then I tried it. It is quite gritty, as if it had occasional specs of very fine glass or sand. Other than that it seemed normal. Yet, at $4-5 per tube, I expected something better. The package states, \"This toothpase was selected for people over 50 because it has a smoother formulation.\" I did not feel that way... I cannot attest to the truth of other claims, but its ONLY active ingredient (Stannous fluoride) apprently has side effects: the package states, \"products containing Stannous fluoride may produce surface staining of the teeth\"."
5.00,"This product was fabulous!!! It tastes so minty not like medicine like some mouthwashes. Crest Pro-Health left my mouth feeling cleaned and refreshed. It is priced just right and I'm switching from my \"OLD\" brand to Crest Pro-Health."
5.00,"My mouth feels so clean and I will never switch products!"
5.00,"The taste was so refreshing and it left my teeth feeling clean"
5.00,"I tried Crest Pro-Health Clinical Plaque Control toothpaste and found it to have a nice flavor. The paste was non abrasive and didn't leave a residue that was hard to rinse. After brushing, my teeth and mouth felt clean, fresh, and my breath had a nice minty scent."
5.00,"My family uses this paste all the time. We always use Crest Toothpaste wherever we go"
4.00,"Product made my mouth feel refreshed and clean. I liked the taste and will buy again."
1.00,"I used this only once, and later that day I noticed I couldn't taste the delicious cherries I had enjoyed only the night before - they simply taste like nothing. Though my ability to taste other flavors seem unchanged, I've stopped using it. I can't believe the FDA allows this to be sold over the counter."
4.00,"not quite sure until I use it longer and more of it, but no complaints so far :)"
1.00,"So ive been using this for a few months after my dentist recommended it. It causes brown stains that cant be removed by brushing... NOT RECOMMENDED!"
5.00,"I love this mouthwash, I used it once and now I can't live without it! I have told my family and friends and they now use it also."
5.00,"I definitely recommend Crest products. In my opinion Crest is the most innovative brand on the market. I have used crest for many many years, but the pro health clinical products are the best of the best. Sure I've tried other brands of dential products because of their claims, but none have out done the Crest Brand. I love the fresh clean feeling I get each time I brush my teeth and it's true you really do feel like you just left the dentist. I'm done with other brands. I am committed to Crest Pro Health Clinical products. And that's that!"
1.00,"If you have sensitive teeth, RUN, don't walk away from this product. If you use a sensitive toothpaste, it will quite literally STRIP the sensitive toothpaste protection from your teeth and you will be in unbearable agony. I would give this product negative starts if I could. Listerine may burn, but the burning stops. If you have sensitive teeth it will take over a week away from this product to begin to build your resistance back up. Shame on you Crest!"
5.00,"I tried the Crest Pro Health toothpaste and loved it even more than the other minty Crest I was using and will be switching."
4.00,"My teeth really felt like I had just gotten my teeth professionally cleaned. They felt smooth and my breath was fresh."
2.00,"I don't doubt the ultimate results I would get by using this product longterm, but I just can't get over the aftertaste that lasted for hours and even seemed to alter the taste of my food."
4.00,"I am never completely blown away by a toothpaste, but this one was great. It gets my teeth clean and tastes good."
5.00,"It's usually hard to choose a stand-out toothpaste (and remember it all the way from the sink to the drug store) but this specific Crest makes itself memorable. In combination with my electric toothbrush, my teeth felt clinically clean - like I was fresh from the dentist!"
5.00,"After using this product for only the first time, my teeth felt more clean then they did with my normal toothpaste. I very well may be switching!"
4.00,"I liked using this mouthwash. Left my mouth with a fresh, but not burning, feeling. I do recommend this to others to give it a try."
1.00,"The Crest Pro-Health For Life may well work wonders for your oral health, but first you'll have to get past the taste, or the lack thereof. At first I noticed the chemical aftertaste, but didn't think much of it. It tasted bad, but if the product worked, then it was worth the temporary unpleasant aftertaste. The problem is that it doesn't end there. It actually altered my sense of taste to the extent that I couldn't taste much of anything. Imagine biting into one of your favorites foods only to taste a muted, chalky-tasting version of what you remember. I wasn't expecting that.The active ingredient in Crest Pro Health For Life rinse is cetylpyridinium chloride (or CPC), which is known to cause temporary impairment of taste. Crest knows this and openly admits to it on their news site (news.crest.com). CPC basically stays in the mouth for long periods of time (which is why it works for as long as it does) and can cause temporary aftertaste and can alter the taste of food for some people. This aftertaste/change in taste typically goes away once use of the product is discontinued. Noting that, I poured what was left of the bottle down the sink and will never purchase any product containing CPC again."
3.00,"I love the way this mouthwash works, but the taste leaves a lot to be desired. They would make it less foamy! It's almost hard to use, but I love the results. Its a love/hate relationship."
4.00,"It was a good toothpaste not entirely unique but I still liked it."
5.00,"tooth paste made my teeth feel fresh and clean. love crest products"
1.00,"At the dentist my hygienist took one look at my teeth and asked if I used Crest pro health mouth wash. Why? Because my teeth were much more stained than what would naturally happen in a few months (I had thought my coffee habit had gotten way out of control...) she let me know this is a common problem with the brand.                                              I was seriously shocked! It should be pulled from the shelves and Crest should be horrified to have sold this product. I feel like this is a way to con customers into purchasing their whitening products once they've ruined your teeth.                                              I'll never use any crest product ever again - there is a market full of competitors so it's very easy not to."
5.00,"I had noticeable results just after 1 week! I highly suggest this product!"
5.00,"Very good value and a great product. Love this toothpaste!"
4.00,"Well, if you like the taste of Pepto-Bismol (I don't!), then you'll LOVE this stuff! The tastes almost gags me but if I hold my breath, then I don't taste it and it works so well that it's worth all of that aggravation. However, like the first reviewer indicated, you HAVE to rinse your mouth with water after using this stuff. It just puts so much foam in your mouth and then leaves this slimy feeling that you really have to. Plus, it is very strong so using it more than once daily, or even every other day would be over the top. It does what it says but again, DON't swallow the stuff and I wouldn't use it as often as they recommend. I used it last night before bed and now, it's before bed right now and I can still feel it in my mouth! I do recommend it but not for daily use - probably every 2 or so days is all you'll need for plaque reduction. Get a trial size first, however, before biting off a larger bottle to see if it works for you."
4.00,"There is a noticeable difference In this line. The plaque control tooth paste helps to minimize the plaque and whiten my teeth. The combination of the mouthwash and the paste makes my mouth seem super fresh. My teeth feel smoother longer."
4.00,"My teeth felt like I had just had them cleaned at the dentist."
5.00,"Thank-you very much!"
1.00,"While using this toothpaste for several months, my husband, age 69, suffered lip sores and peeling and had a red ring around his mouth.  One doctor diagnosed cold sores and another simply \"lip inflammation.\"  The prescribed medicines did not help.  We finally got on line and learned about the similar problems others have had.  After stopping the product a few days, my husband is back to normal."
5.00,"It has a much better taste then I remember of crest tooth paste. My teeth look and feel cleaner. I am glad I gave Crest another try!"
5.00,"made me feel like a got a complete cleaning with this product!"
1.00,"Irritated skin tissue in mouth both along cheek and gums, my skin was shedding after every use which is not normal and should not happen. I have since switched back to my Aqua fresh extreme clean which I've used for years with no ill side-effects. I bought into the Crest pro-health craze cause it sounded good, but turned out it was too good to be true! This product should not be allowed to be sold since I've been to other message boards and I'm one of many others who've been harmed by this product, shame on you Crest toothpaste, the consumer has spoken!"
1.00,"I was recommended this product by my hygienist after she told me I was showing the beginnings of gum disease. I picked up a bottle and within two hours of using it I noticed a complete loss of taste and my tongue felt as if I had scalded it with hot coffee. As a physician I am shocked this is on the market, particularly when the bottle contains no warnings of these side effects. Doing a bit of research on the web will show some folks symptoms are much worse than mine. It would not surprise me if P&G ended up with a suit against them for marketing this menace."
4.00,"I am very picky about the taste of toothpaste and how my teeth feel after brushing. Both the taste and the quality was there with this product. Would certainly buy again."
4.00,"I have always loved Crest products. I get the clean I need."
5.00,"This is an amazing product! It actually does clean the stains off your teeth. *Use for three weeks, then switch to another toothpaste because your teeth will become too sensitive if you do not."
5.00,"I've been using colgate all my life then a month ago I purchased this product at walmart because my husband likes this specific brand of toothpaste. Ever since I've used this toothpaste my teeth is a lot whiter and I've only used it for a month. I like fresh and clean feeling it gives me after I brush. I've have tired all the different kinds of colgate and never seen my teeth is white. I'm so glad I gave it this brand a try I will never switch back to colgate."
5.00,"Same feeling of clean when you leave a dentist office"
1.00,"I purchased this product and used it 3-4 times before I realized that it was burning my tongue and tastebuds - I haven't been able to properly taste food since. Since this is a common problem I went ahead and called Crest and filed a complaint on it - I used the number 1-800-285-9139. If you had the same problem definitely file a report so they know what is going on and we can get this product off the shelves!"
2.00,"My biggest problem with this product was the taste. It was so bad that I ended up giving away the bottle. So I didn't use it long enough to see any results as far as whitening."
5.00,"Since I've been using this toothpaste at night before bedtime, my teeth have been tartar free. The tartar buildup on my bottom four front teeth (23-26 lingual) was so bad I had to see the dental hygienist every four months. It's been almost four months since my last dental appointment and my teeth look like they've just been cleaned. I'll be able to return to six-month checkups. This is a great toothpaste."
5.00,"The top pick for mouth wash"
4.00,"I really liked how fresh my mouth felt after using this. It didn't burn like some mouth rinse can."
5.00,"I also got a cavity-free checkup from my dentist. You can't beat that!"
5.00,"i found my teeth cleaner and it works very well with electric toothbrush!!!! and well its totally worth the money!"
2.00,"I wish I had a different review to write here. I'm sure this is a good product and gets your mouth really clean, but I just can't get past the medicine taste. I like a minty-flavored mouthwash and this one just didn't do it for me."
4.00,"How many people have to complain about this before Crest reacts?"
4.00,"I really liked the toothpaste. My teeth felt really clean and seemed to stay cleaner longer. Loved the flavor, it seemed to stay around longer than other toothpastes ive used before."
5.00,"There is not much to say here. I bought this toothpaste years ago in Canada on a work trip where my luggage was lost. Loved the way it cleans. Just the right amount of grit like you would have after a cleaning at the dentist. The night version has a slightly different flavor to others I have tried and I highly suggest it. Unfortunately I have had trouble finding it in the States (the night version at least). Amazon to the rescue!"
5.00,"I'm not sure if this is the mouthwash that required the user to gargle for at least a min. I'm rather impatient when it comes to gargling that long. There's a similar product (same brand) that has the user rinse for 30 seconds, twice a day. I like using that product. This product itself does its purpose."
5.00,"Just what I needed a toothpaste that attacked the plaque. This is a HUGE issue for me and now that this toothpaste has been found I will keep using as long as I can."
5.00,"Doesn't taste bad and gets teeth clean! I have really enjoyed using this!"
1.00,"I heard about this mouthwash because it didn't have alcohol and was good for enamel. Both my husband and I used it two nights ago. When I woke up, I noticed my tongue was numb and I had a significant loss of taste. It reminded me of what happens when you burn your tongue on a hot drink/food item. It bothered me but I figured it was just because it was doing its job and the feeling would go away. It did, but 12 hours later. I thought, \"Weird, well, maybe it won't do it again tomorrow.\" Same exact feeling today. Even just cold water tastes and feels funny. Sort of metallic. I was concerned and decided to look it up. \"Mouthwash tongue numb\" brought up an entire page of complaints about this exact product/brand. The symptoms all had a similar ring to my own (except I thankfully don't suffer from sores, peeling skin, or swollen glands). I mentioned this to my husband and he said he'd been feeling it too and thought it was weird but, like me, thought it was just doing its job. I've never had a mouthwash leave my tongue numb and tasteless for 12 hours. 20 if you include the 8 hours of sleep. So, Crest Pro-Health Complete, here is my review of your product: It tastes fine until I can't taste anymore. My mouth feels numb and burns. Thanks for the \"clean\" mouth, guys."
5.00,"for some reason this is no longer sold in stores,so glad i was able to find it on-ljne,should last me awhile;)"
4.00,"Overall, I really liked Crest ProHealth Clinical Plaque Control. It cleaned my teeth really well (just like all Crest toothpastes do - much better than other brands, in my opinion). The Fresh Mint flavor is a favorite with me, so I was glad to see it used for this paste. The flavor is mild enough not to burn your mouth and tongue, but long-lasting to keep your breath clean and minty for several hours. The only drawback for me - when I used the Plaque Control when brushing before bed, I noticed a little film would be on my molars when I woke up the next morning. I don't know if this is the toothpaste, or my mouth reacting to some ingredient in the toothpaste, but it made me immediately want to brush my teeth to get that film off. It felt weird and really made me want to get my teeth clean. That may not be a drawback after all."
5.00,"I will def recommend this toothpaste and toothbrush combination to everyone that will listen! I appreciate the wonderful feeling of \"NO FILM\" on my teeth half way through my day!"
3.00,"While only time will truly tell if this product improves any dental issues I might have, on the basics it absolutely performs as advertised. It is terrific if you have any dental sensitivities - I have not felt a twinge of discomfort while using this toothpaste. Moreover, while in the beginning I wasn't sure I liked the \"smooth mint\" flavor, I am now a convert. My main concern was that it wouldn't be an effective breath freshener because it's pretty \"low key\" and mint flavors go. I have found, however, that while it is not intense mint, it does seem to last quite well."
5.00,"Love this mouthwash! Not only does it get my teeth whiter but helps in overall gum wellness!!"
4.00,"This product not only fights cavities, it also clears pimples, and can be used to repair small holes in the wall. Many purposes. To my dismay, cats do not like it."
5.00,"This is a great toothpaste. I sometimes don't like toothpaste flavors but the taste of this one is great. It leaves my mouth and gums tingling and feeling refreshed. My teeth feel very smooth and clean after using it. I have noticed my gums are looking better after using this for the last month; they are less red and I have no more bleeding when I brush. I definitely recommend this toothpaste for improving and maintaining your gum health!"
4.00,"really like this mouthwash, but might be too pricey for most people...including me."
2.00,"it did not leave a fresh or minty taste rather a slightly bitter one."
5.00,"after trying many brands over the years,is nice to find this almost as good like the dentist office strenght and let me control the plaque and leave it at bay"
5.00,"I love how clean this toothpaste leaves my teeth and gums. I used to buy whatever toothpaste was on sale, but now, I buy only this product based on the superior results. It seems more abrasive than other toothpastes, which leads me to believe cleans superiorly. I have 8 porcelain veneers and have had no issues after using this toothpaste for the paste 6 months. I used to accrue stains around the gum line of the veneers occasionally but no longer have that problem. I will say, like other users, I did notice the interior of my gums \"shedding\" but not in a painful way. I attribute it to the cleaning power of the product. Its more like a gentle exfoliation than anything unpleasant, and my mouth feels cleaner and longer."
5.00,"I used my coupons from Vocalpoint to buy the Crest Pro-Health Clinical Plaque Control. My family really liked the fact that there teeth felt cleaner and brighter after using the Pro-Health Plaque Control toothpaste. The taste just made my mouth feel fresher and the taste was not overpowering like some toothpastes that claim to do the same thing. Overall, I would choose the Crest Pro-Health Clinical Plaque Control toothpaste over other brands."
4.00,"Our entire family liked this product. It was a very clean fresh feeling that I was very pleased with."
4.00,"My teeth still feel clean, hours after brushing with the Crest complete toothpaste and my breath feels fresh. But I honestly can't feel a difference between this and Colgate Total."
5.00,"I love the squeeky clean feeling of my teeth after brushing with Crest! It's just like leaving the dentist's office after getting my biannual cleaning."
1.00,"I agree with others that this product is poison! After using this mouthwash (thinking I would try something different from Listerine)I started noticing that when brushing my teeth my gums would bleed. AND, it wasn't just a small amount. I would spit out a few mouthfuls of bright red blood. I also noticed that I had areas of my gums that felt raw. If this product continues to cause harm to people, the makers of this product may have a product liability class action on their hands. In the meantime, I have switched back to Listerine."
5.00,"This is the new one and only rinse at our house! My husband uses this daily and has requested that this be the brand we stick with."
3.00,"This toothpaste left my breath fresh. I may buy it again, although the price is a bit higher compared to some other toothpastes I've tried in the past and liked."
5.00,"Love this tooth paste because it makes my mouth feel clean and fresh."
4.00,"I been using some Crest products for years and I am extremely pleased with this purchase and I plan on buying more."
5.00,"I have searched all over every store that I could go to and could not find this product anywhere! I happened to do a search on your site and actually found the tubes for sale! It's nice to know that you can still find things on Amazon that are no longer in the stores for sale!"
4.00,"this product has a great clean fresh taste, makes your mouth tingle. I will recommend it to everyone."
3.00,"Great stuff. The mouthwash really seems to do what it promises in terms of keeping my teeth healthy and avoiding plaque buildup. My main issue with it is that it seems to leave its own film in place of the plaque. It's not awful or particularly bothersome- just noticeable. Leaves my mouth/teeth with an odd feeling for a few minutes until it goes away. Overall I still recommend this mouthwash for its clinical benefits and nice mint taste."
4.00,"...if so, you will love this product. My regular toothpaste got my teeth clean, or at least I thought it did. In fact, if I hadn't tried the new Crest toothpaste I may always have thought my teeth were getting as clean as they could be. Now that I have experienced this kind of clean, I will likely make the change permanent."
4.00,"Crest's latest products are the best for taking care of your whole mouth! This toothpaste leaves your teeth feeling fresh, shiny and healthy-clean. I trust that it is offering me the best way to take care of my teeth."
5.00,"My teeth felt smooth and cleaner after using. Would recommend."
4.00,"The product provides great looking teeth with a great clean feel every time."
4.00,"Essy to use, great flavor! I will definitely be rcommending this to others"
5.00,"I loved the results I got from this toothpaste along with the great flavor!"
5.00,"This toothpaste is awesome. The toothpaste kept my mouth tasting fresh for hours. I defiently recommend this toothpaste."
3.00,"My teeth felt super clean and my mouth felt really fresh. The product is a little pricey for my regular use, though."
4.00,"I love the cleaner feeling I get by using mouthwash after brushing. Good taste and lasts a long time"
5.00,"I love Crest! Always use this brand. My mouth feels fresh and clean."
5.00,"I love this mouth wash. It makes my teeth feel sparkly clean and my breath fresh as if I came back from the dentist office. highly recommended!"
5.00,"l Love this toothpaste. Will buy again. Try it, you will agree."
4.00,"This is a nice rinse, the taste is not overwhelming, but be warned it does stay with you for a long time. I appreciate the way it doesn't dry my mouth and sting like mouthwashes with alcohol. I did not have any issues with staining, although it does warn you that this is a possible but not permanent side effect. The one strange thing that I have to mention is that every time I look at the bottle, I get reminded of Windex, and I wonder why companies can't just make a clear mouthwash since it just give me a strange feeling rinsing with it. Small issue I know, but I thought I'd put it out there!"
4.00,"like the flavor.. and wasnt to strong.. even great for kids"
5.00,"I purchased this product for my boyfriend who has sensitive teeth. Within a few weeks, he noticed that sensitivity was a lot less and that his teeth were brighter than they had been. Now he's a fan for life!"
4.00,"My mouth really feels fresh and clean after using."
5.00,"Crest Clinical is a great product. This product does all it claims it will do."
5.00,"My teeth look and feel great! They not only look clean, but they feel clean too."
4.00,"Crest has always maintained a level of quality I can rely on, and this product goes right along with the expectations I've built around the brand. The taste and consistency are interchangeable for other Crest varieties."
1.00,"I order off of amazon a lot. Normally, the product size listed in the item title is for each item in the pack, i.e., \"75oz (Pack of 4)\" means it is a pack of 4 75 oz items. In this case, \"Twin pack, 8-Ounce\" actually means you are getting 2 4 oz tubes, which is half of what I expected, so beware. I do like the product but not at double the price I expected."
5.00,"I really like crest pro-health toothpaste. It leaves my mouth minty fresh and clean."
5.00,"Crest's new Pro Health Cinical Strength mouthwash leaves your mouth feeling fresh and clean.it has a bubbling action that helps to remove plague and fine particles from between your teeth and below the gum line."
5.00,"This toothpaste works great at alleviating my sensitive teeth problem. The cinnamon flavor freshens your breath and leaves your mouth feeling fresh."
5.00,"I've used this toothpaste for several months and have been very pleased with the results. My teeth feel cleaner longer. Plus, the toothpaste has a refreshing taste. I definitely recommend."
4.00,"I've been using the same toothpaste for years. The one i've stuck to for years I would sear by it. This toothpaste by crest met my expectations and I will continue to use this again and more often."
4.00,"I'm very surprised by the bad reviews of this toothpaste - I love it and it has been a lifesaver during pregnancy, which has made my gums incredibly sensitive. This toothpaste has relieved a lot of the sensitivity in my gums. I haven't experienced any of the negative side effects that other people complain of."
5.00,"this toothpaste is really good, it made my mouth feel cleaner. I really like it."
3.00,"The toothpaste made my teeth and mouth feel clean, but I did not like the taste. I usually love the taste of Crest, but not this one."
4.00,"The Crest Pro-Health line is another win for the Crest products. I felt that while cleaning my teeth and gums they helped whiten my teeth and maintain cavity control and plaque also. It was a fresh-clean feeling after using the toothpaste, not a sugary over minty taste. I have purchased, recommended and been extremely pleased with the results of the toothpaste, tooth brush and mouth wash."
4.00,"New Pro-Health Clinical products from Crest was a great product, it made my teeth feel extremely clean."
4.00,"I love when my teeth feel clean and smooth. That feeling lasts longer with Crest ProHealth Clinical."
5.00,"I enjoyed using the Crest Pro-Health toothpaste. It made my breath fresh and my mouth felt very clean. Like after the dentist clean. I was surprised that this toothpaste could provide that dentist clean feeling. I definitely recommend this product to everyone."
4.00,"This product kept my mouth feeling clean. I also noticed a reduction in the amount of plaque on my teeth. It did not completely remove or reduce all plaque, but I did notice a difference. I also feel that my teeth are a bit stronger and whiter after using this product. I will continue to use this product. However, I wish they would make it a bit stronger for great results. This product lives up to its product and the Crest name."
4.00,"I definitely notice a clean feeling difference when I use my rinse. Flavor is still a little intense but at least not medicinal or burning. Haven't had another checkup since starting but will be interesting to see what my dentist says in 2 months."
5.00,"This product left my mouth feeling clean, and within two uses, I could see the difference in color."
4.00,"I love how my teeth feel squeaky clean after each brushing! I will be buying this toothpaste again."
3.00,"I thought they were ok. When I tried the Crest I compared it to my current brand it was just ok. I won't switch but I would recommend people to try it."
5.00,"Crest Pro-health toothpaste did the job of cleaning my teeth. It usually is the first toothpaste I reach for."
4.00,"I didn't like the aftertaste but my teeth felt very clean!"
4.00,"I love using Crest Pro-health because not only does it get my teeth cleaned but it works well with my sensitive teeth. There are so many toothpastes out there on the market that make the sensitivity worse so I have to then use a sensitive toothpaste that just doesn't get my teeth very clean!"
5.00,"The toothpaste tastes great, gets my teeth white, and provides me with a feeling that is better than a just went to the dentist cleaning!! After a couple weeks, I could definitely notice the difference in how my teeth felt and looked. Great multi-task toothpaste for a reasonable price!"
5.00,"I love this product it really cleaned my teeth well. I think it is also making my teeth whiter. i have only been using it for 1 week so well see how well it brightens my smile in the next couple of weeks."
3.00,"I went to the store excited about purchasing these Crest products, but even with the coupons they were more expensive than I was willing to spend on other Crest or store-brand products that I know from experience work well. I decided not to even try the products because of this. However, the packaging makes them easy to spot on the shelf, which is refreshing in an aisle where everything looks alike."
1.00,"This toothpaste caused the lining of my mouth (between gums and lip) to start coming off. At first I just thought I had a bunch of dead skin until it started happening everyday all day long after brushing. I also got tons of very painful canker sores all over my mouth that lasted for 3 weeks after I realized it was the toothpaste and stopped using it. The worst experience ever!!!"
5.00,"This rinse leaves my mouth feeling refreshed while it fights buildup. I feel good about having my son use it - he wears braces and I picture it getting in all the crevices around those braces."
4.00,"After trying this mouth rinse (I do not normally use mouth rinse), I am amazed at how clean my mouth feels. It is a great addition to the toothpaste."
3.00,"And by that I mean the active ingredient, cetylpyridinium chloride, is great for killing bacteria and, unfortunatly for some, the sense of taste. This problem does not affect me, and it seems to be sort of hit or miss. I would recommend this product if you are bothered by the burning sensation of alcohol based mouth rinses, and then I would recommend starting with a small size, just in case you are prone to the effect on taste. Finally, regarding the tooth discoloration some have mentioned, I would recommend the clear version (why we need dye added to a product used in an area we want to keep white, i have no idea) and making sure that it is not a version with flouride, which can certainly discolor teeth."
4.00,"Mint Pro-Health has a very nice minty taste. I like that it kills germs and can help the overall health of your teeth and gums. Unlike Listerine, this has a fresh taste and isn't too over powering to use. I have always trusted the Crest brand and I feel as though using this kills bacteria that brushing can't. The fresh taste lasts for a while and you can use this to freshen your breath anytime.I do like the taste and use it in conjunction with brushing a couple times a day. It seems to me that my dentist told me a while back that this product can stain teeth, but I am thinking it was the blue Pro-Health product that people were having trouble with. So far, I haven't experienced any staining but will be on the lookout."
5.00,"crest pro health plaque toothpaste is so great and amazing. its so powerfully amazinging. it taste great and it does all the work for you. my tooth are so white i dont have to go to the dentist and pay hundreds of dollars now to whiten them. thanks a million crest."
5.00,"If you drink pure cranberry juice, coffee, or smoke, you'll want a daily whitening toothpaste. I use it with the polishing head on my electric toothbrush, and I do notice that it helps to maintain whiteness versus non-whitening toothpaste. I must admit, I like the taste of Crest Pro Health and I regularly use several different kinds of their toothpaste. I also use the sensitivity version and it does work well. Contrary to other reviews, it does not stain your teeth brown, not sure what is going on with those other reviewers. It works fine for me."
1.00,"THIS PRODUCT IS TERRIBLE! IT STAINS YOUR TEETH. I EVEN EMAILED P&G AND THEY SAID IT WAS NORMAL BACTERIAL BUILD UP AND THAT IT WOULD GO AWAY WITH A DENTAL CLEANING. THE STAINS DID GO AWAY BUT THE CLEANING WASN'T CHEAP! IF YOU DON'T WANT TO WASTE MORE MONEY HAVING TO GET THE STAINS REMOVED THAN DON'T BUY THIS!"
5.00,"I really enjoyed the Crest Pro-Health mouthwash. The minty flavor was very refreshing. The mouthwash did not make me gag and left my mouth feeling squeaky clean!"
3.00,"I ordered this Crest Pro-Health Clinical Gum Protection Invigorating Clean Mint toothpaste as I had recently purchased the same \"flavor/type\" mouthwash that matches it. The taste isn't bad and combining the two makes my mouth feel clean. If memory serves me correctly, it will take longer than 30 days for any health-related changes to take place with my teeth and gums. In that case, I will need to add to my review at a later time."
5.00,"I loved this Crest! It makes your teeth feel super clean."
5.00,"Crest has always been my favorite, and this toothpaste just confirms it! It tastes good and made my mouth feel clean and fresh."
4.00,"I like this product. It is a little pricey, but a good product."
4.00,"I was very impressed with the way my mouth felt after using this toothpaste. It lasted a long time too. I felt like my mouth was fresher and cleaner even after a couple of hours. Thanks!!"
5.00,"Great mouth wash, kills bad breath and you don't smell like alcohol"
5.00,"I care a lot about my dental health. I've used Colgate befor I had an opportunity to try Crest. I used Crest for the first time and I can tell you that it is LOVE from the first try! I'm happy with the flavor. It is fresh and clean. I rarely have cavities, so I know it is also an effective brand. I am a coffee&tea drinker, and I like the whitening action of this brand. I highly recommend Crest products. You will not be disappointed."
4.00,"Keeps my teeth feeling fresh and clean! Felt it was a little rough on my sensitive teeth, that's why I didn't give a 5 over all."
5.00,"I love how clean my teeth feel after using this toothpaste! It has a great taste too!"
5.00,"After brushing left my mouth fresh all day. Loved it"
5.00,"Teeth felt clean for many hours, breath freshened."
4.00,"Loved the way my teeth felt sooo clean! Thanks for a great product!"
4.00,"No cotton mouth like many alcohol based mouthwash."
4.00,"I love the way this toothpaste makes my mouth feel clean and also my teeth. I would buy this again. Thanks"
5.00,"I had serious teeth bleeding before. However, when I used the toothpaste, the bleeding recovered. Now I am still using it."
1.00,"Like many of the other 1-star reviews said, this stuff has some nasty side effects. Within two days, my mouth and tongue developed numerous sores, and my tongue often tingled and began going numb. It wasn't catastrophic, but it was a constant source of irritation. I stopped after about 5 days, and within a few days, the sores healed and my tongue felt normal again. I don't know why this stuff is so caustic, but I have never had this experience with other mouthwashes. Even Crest's regular Pro-Health Rinse I am a fan of. But something just isn't right about this stuff. I wonder if it has to do with the hydrogen peroxide; tucked away under \"inactive ingredients\" is hydrogen peroxide (which is not an ingredient in the regular Pro-Health Rinse). I've used hydrogen peroxide as a mouthwash before, and it can be mildly irritating at first (though far less so than this stuff). I wonder what the concentration is; it's not listed because hydrogen peroxide is an \"inactive\" ingredient (even though it probably contributes to the reversal of gingivitis). The hydrogen peroxide you buy at the store is only 3% and it doesn't bother my mouth (although it can burn somewhat when you first start). If this stuff is more concentrated, that could explain it. Or maybe it's something about the overall chemical composition. Maybe hydrogen peroxide reacts with the active ingredient, cetylpyridinum chloride. Or maybe the increase from 0.07% to 0.1% cetylpyridinum chloride is more than the mouth can handle (though I doubt it). Whatever the case, this stuff doesn't belong in a human mouth. Maybe if you're a paid subject and have to use it the full 2 weeks it may in fact reverse gingivitis, but it's not worth it. There are other options. If you have gingivitis, brush with (3%) hydrogen peroxide for a week or two; that did the trick for me."
5.00,"I told my friends about how great it worked and what a clean feeling it left me and my family with."
3.00,"I apparently have a sensitivity to this product, which has caused a dull ache in one area of my mouth."
5.00,"This tasted good and it really made me teeth clean!"
4.00,"Only been using a few weeks. Can't tell much of a difference between it and other Crest brands for mouthwash. We'll see when it comes dentist time and will report back then."
5.00,"Crest has come out with another unique product. This rinse is superior to any of its competitors. Complements brushing and flossing. Thank you Crest for your innovation!"
4.00,"tastes great and leaves a fresh feeling. Cheaper than listerine however i feel the fresh feeling doesn't last as long."
4.00,"At my six month checkup I had no cavities and my teeth were fine. My teeth seem to look whiter and brighter. I loved the way my teeth felt clean and shiny after using Crest Pro Health Toothpaste."
4.00,"From trying this toothpaste, I am a believer. It tastes great and leaves a long lasting effect. My teeth felt almost as clean as when I am leaving the dentist. I have only used it for about a week, so I cant comment to all it claims to do, but I do believe it cleans better than most others."
5.00,"This stuff has some 'grit' to it, it actually feels like it works too. Normal toothpaste seems much too liquidy and just kind of slides off your teeth and brush and more just sits on your tongue and gum areas...not this stuff."
5.00,"I love this toothpaste it made my teeth feel very clean and the after morning feel was still like I just brushed them !!"
5.00,"I liked that this mouthwash did not burn my mouth. It did not have a nasty flavor either. My mouth felt clean and fresh afterwards."
1.00,"I picked up this Crest Pro Health Mouth Rinse at Sam's Club- was out of my regular mouthwash & figured I'd try this (and that the flouride might be a nice addition)-- WRONG. I used the rinse twice daily and was not immediately aware of a loss of taste sensation, but within 2 weeks had lost my sensation of sweetness for the first time in my life. Kind of suspected the Pro-Health as this was the only change in my routine. I am in good health otherwise. Continued using for about 2 more weeks and sense of taste worsened so all food tasted bland/different. Just started researching on the web and see numerous others with same problem. Will stop using immediately and hope normal taste will resume soon (I read that taste buds are replaced about every ten days). Perhaps only a small peercentage of users experience this problem, but I sure did. BEWARE!!!! (Crest should provide a warning on the label!)"
5.00,"Crest Pro Health is the only tooth paste my family will use!"
5.00,"It tasted great and kept my teeth feeling clean for hours"
5.00,"i havnt used this yet but it smells good"
5.00,"This toothpaste is great! Tastes great and works great :)"
5.00,"I enjoyed this product - it actually works. My teeth felt and looked healthy and so clean. I used it twice a day (am & pm). Even after sleeping my teeth didn't feel icky in the morning. I will continue to use this product and recommend it to family and friends."
5.00,"I love Crest ProHealth Clinical mouth rinse. It give me that \"just got my teeth cleaned\" feeling every day. I've notice healthier gums, whiter teeth, and fresher breath while using it. I love this stuff and I highly recommend."
5.00,"Surprising my parents for whom this toothpaste was targeted, did not like the texture of the toothpaste. I did not want to waste it so it became my work place toothpaste. The product has a light, natural paste that is slightly gritty, it has the same texture as organic based toothpaste with a very baking soda feel. I really loved this product, paste is light and the gritty feel helps polish my teeth. I still get the same clean feel in my mouth as my other thick whitening toothpaste. My gums look and feel fine and it does not make my teeth sensitive. This review may change after I see my dentist since it claims to prevent enamel wear, but all in all I would recommend the use of this toothpaste. I even bought two more tubes."
4.00,"I really liked this toothpaste. It has a great taste and it works well. My teeth felt clean and stayed fresh for a while after brushing."
4.00,"The Crest Pro-Health Clinical mouthwash has a pleasant taste and left my mouth feeling clean."
5.00,"I looked at all the negative reviews on this site and thought, \"what the h**!?\" I've used crest pro-health for years with no issues such as brown teeth, loss of taste, etc etc. My hygienist recommended it and she's been giving me compliments on my teeth and gums at my appointments. So I'm with the 5 star reviewers on this one!"
4.00,"The flavor was refreshing, , even my children enjoyed using it!"
1.00,"CREST PRO HEALTH products can cause brown stains on teeth - check the packaging label. Fortunately I've heard these stains can be easily removed at the dentist."
5.00,"This Colgate Plaque Fighter is a great product.I love how clean my mouth feels after using it!"
4.00,"Really like this toothpaste as it left my teeth and mouth feeling clean. I didn't mind the taste and all around it did what it said it was supposed to do."
1.00,"Several weeks ago I was noticing stringy, fleshy, gooey residue in my mouth. Thought I had some dreaded gum disease! It was as if my gums were melting away. Thought I had some dreaded gum disease! I just stumbled onto these reviews and realized I had been using Crest Pro Health at the time. I could never have imagined it was the toothpaste. INCREDIBLE"
2.00,"I found it too runny and lose some product each time. Don't like the cap. It was expensive."
4.00,"I really enjoyed using this product. It seemed to work very well. My teeth felt cleaner and smoother feeling to my tongue when I ran it over them. My teeth looked brighter after using it. I had told alot of people to take a look at my teeh before I used it and then again after and they too thought my teeth looked brighter and better after using it. I told quite a few people how impressed I was with it."
5.00,"I was amazed that my mouth could feel so clean and fresh."
5.00,"This toothpaste is very effective and your mouth feels real clean."
4.00,"I did think this product really left your teeth feeling clean. I do prefer a stronger minty flavor and thus I did not give this the highest rating."
5.00,"How does one review a toothpaste which claims to have long-term benefits such as preservation of enamel? Admittedly this is very hard unless one waited for years. So I'll just consider short-term benefits. First, how well does it clean? Well I can honestly say my teeth feel squeaky clean. Not all toothpaste I've used in the past gives you this clean a feel. But it is not unique to this brand as I have found a few other brands that imparted this squeaky clean feel. When I say squeaky clean, I mean when you run your tongue around your teeth you can feel how smooth and clean they are. Taste? Very good minty taste. No complaints. It is perfectly pleasant. Does it freshen breath? Well, my mouth and breath seem really fresh and clean after using so I'm sold on that part, I've only used it for a few weeks, so cannot comment on how well it works for surface stains, or weak gums or enamel. Did not notice any significant whitening though. Would I buy this in the future? Definitely. The potential long-term benefits are promising and Crest is a company I can trust. I've used them for other products in the past (such as whitening strips) with very good results."
5.00,"My teeth felt super clean after use. I love Crest products and it is a name you can trust :)"
4.00,"It does a nice job at cleaning teeth and leaving your mouth feeling fresh. However it is quite pricey so I don't know if it'd be in my budget to buy such expensive toothpaste"
4.00,"I thought the toothpaste did its job. The flavor was not as good as their scope brand but my teeth felt clean as always."
5.00,"We love the clean, fresh feeling we get after using this toothpaste!"
4.00,"Cleaned very well, left a great feeling in my mouth afterwards. And a great value for the price!"
5.00,"Mouthwash left my mouth feeling clean and wonderful all day long! Will purchase again!"
5.00,"This left my mouth feeling really clean and no medicine taste."
4.00,"I tried the crest pro health clinical plaque control toothpaste and I thought it worked really well. It removed plaques well and freshened my breath and helped with tarta control. I think after continued use it might help to whiten teeth too. I would definitely recommend this product or another Crest toothpaste!"
5.00,"My mouth feels SOOOO clean after using this! Great stuff!"
5.00,"love it great product works well good value tastes great"
4.00,"By far, my favorite toothpaste is the Crest brand. This particular type of toothpaste is even an improvement from the former Crest brands!!"
4.00,"I love the how clean it makes my mouth feel! It works much better than anything else I have tried."
5.00,"Leaves a gently tingle in my mouth. Highly Reccomend!"
5.00,"I tried the Cresh Pro Health and went to my dentist for a routine check up day before yesterday. She was pleased at how clean my teeth were and I think they look fantastic. This toothpaste seems to really get the plaque and stains and everything and is an all in one product. It is cheaper than going to the dentist to get the same results!"
5.00,"I liked how my mouth feels after I use the mouthwash"
5.00,"Loved how clean my teeth felt! Good value for the money. Really like how it tasted."
4.00,"Did what it said it would do - not much different than a lot of other toothpastes out there."
1.00,"My husband and I also experience the peeling of the inside of my cheeks. It was really gross. Small sheets of skin would peel off. What could possibly be in this tooth paste to cause your mouth to peel? I will never buy this again."
4.00,"The product leaves your mouth clean and refreshing."
4.00,"Crest has definitely continued to meet my expectations as a lifetime Crest user! Crest is a brand that since i was a little girl, my family has always trusted. Keep up the good work Crest. This product keeps going long after its used. Very long lasting & great clean feel just after 1 use."
5.00,"ANother Great Product from Crest. ALways Quality! Not harsh or Burning!"
5.00,"I really like the taste and feel of the toothpaste on my teeth."
4.00,"This product made my mouth feel wonderful after every use."
1.00,"I purchased this because my grocery was out of Act Total Care (recommended by my dentist- I rate it a 5+). By the end of the bottle my teeth were stained. I got them cleaned today and the hygienist thought that it was due to my mouthwash choice. Don't do it."
4.00,"I loves this rinse and it is light years ahead of others I have tried. It leaves my mouth feeling fresh and clean without the burn that comes along with a lot of oral rinses. It is a bit pricey, but I think, worth it!"
5.00,"Got this Crest Pro-Health Toothpaste along with the Crest Pro-Health Multiprotection Clean Mint Rinse (reviewed there, 4 out of 5). Although I liked the Rinse, this toothpaste is my new favorite paste of choice. I've always like baking soda style toothpastes for the texture, but was never fond of the taste. This is like those, but with a mild minty taste. Seems to be a winning combo for me along with the Rinse."
5.00,"I enjoy how it wasn't so strong.I've always been a bif fan of crest.It makes your mouth feel so fresh and clean."
4.00,"It made my mouth feel so clean and fresh. Give it a try you wont be disappointed."
4.00,"This toothpaste genuinely tastes great, and leaves a fresh mouth feeling afterwards. I will be brushing my teeth even more often now!"
5.00,"My wife is very picky with toothpaste, this one isnt my favorite, but she loves it. she complains it's hard not to just eat it cause it's so good (weirdo). our local target carried it once, we tried it, then went back for a refill and they had stopped carrying it for some reason. so really glad we were able to find it online, and might have been even cheaper than at store, can't verify that though."
5.00,"This is a good whitening tooth paste. But on that same token, I think you may need to be careful with it if you have sensitive teeth, as I do. After using this tooth paste, I had the sensation that I sometimes get when I have left whitening strips on for too long. So, I only use this tooth paste a few times a week. I don't use it as my regular tooth paste."
5.00,"used this product, I thought it did a great job, I will definitely purchase it again in the future."
5.00,"Leaves your mouth feeling fresh and CLEAN and I would recomend this product and will buy it again!"
3.00,"I used this product for a little more than month because I have receding gums in my front bottom 2 teeth because of a permanent retainer.  After a few days of using it, I started noticing a burning/drooling tongue feeling and extremely dry mouth when I woke up as well as painful sores on my tongue.  I also noticed that my tongue got stuck to my inner lower gums because of the dryness.  My inner cheeks were peeling, but I kept using to help with my gums so I decided to finish the tube.  I decided to only use the toothpaste at night because of what I was experiencing.  This always made my gums bleed more than usual.  About 3 weeks ago when the tube was almost done, I woke up with swollen and painful lower back gums and the day after small liquid blisters formed - that was the last time I used the toothpaste.  I started using colgate cavity protection.  One of the sides has healed, but is still a little painful and the other is still a little sore...has anyone experienced this?"
1.00,"I like all that this toothpaste claims to do, and bought it for those various benefits. I've only been using it at night as I use another acid-protection toothpaste in the morning, but no matter how much I rinse after brushing at night I wake up with thick, almost strand-like pieces of film on my teeth and gums from the toothpaste. I stopped using it for awhile and returned to it to verify that this toothpaste was responsible, and it definitely is. Unfortunately, the gross film is not worth Crest's stated benefits."
1.00,"I rarely write reviews, but I cannot believe this product is considered safe for use! Please do not buy Crest Pro-Health toothpaste. After a few day's use, I had ulcers and raw places in my mouth. Then, my throat started closing up. I thought I was having an allergic reaction to something I ate (I have never had an allergic reaction before, but knew this was a symptom).At first I didn't connect the two, but it was the only thing I had changed in my routine. I stopped using the toothpaste and things got better after just one night.Please, Crest, take this off the market!"
5.00,"Highly recommend!"
5.00,"I truly appreciate Crest Prohealth toothpaste because I enjoy the fresh, clean feeling after brushing. I also noticed that it protects my gums and my dentist gave me the best report on keeping my teeth and gums clean. I definitely recommend this product!"
3.00,"I like the tooth paste but the cap is hopeless! I cannot imagine how the cap passed any quality control in the design phase of the product prior to release. The cap literally does not fit after using the toothpaste and although it is designed to stand on the top, the paste oozes out., so it is best to leave on its side."
5.00,"Kind of gritty but it has improved my whiteness (can I really say that here heh) quite a bit in the month I have been using ... the toothpaste ..."
4.00,"This toothpaste works better than most and I recommend it highly."
5.00,"Noticed a huge difference in Crest 3D whitening toothpaste within just a short time of using it compared to my old whitening toothpaste!"
4.00,"I really thought it gave me a clean refreshing feeling. I cant wait to try more products."
4.00,"I used the mouth wash and I instantly felt my mouth cleaner and my breath freasher. Would recommend the product to family and friends."
5.00,"I love the Crest Whitening Moutwash! It makes my teeth feel so clean! My dentist noticed a difference too!"
1.00,"I have been using CREST toothpaste for a few years until recently. Our household uses \"Crest Pro-Health Clinical Gum Protection Toothpaste - Soothing Smooth Mint\". I had replaced the head of my \"Oral-B CrossAction Power Max Whitening Electric Toothbrush\". I've let it sit on its power console to fully charge. After a full day of charging, I used the toothpaste I've been using with the new toothbrush head. Next thing I know, it had caustic effects on my gums. It took a few days for my gums to heal. The outer gum layer had completely eroded leaving my gums raw and red. I think the high speed brushing with an electric toothbrush mixed the chemicals of the toothpaste causing adverse effects on the gums. Many instances of this same reaction have been reported by various consumers on Amazon."
5.00,"Hard to find this flavor. Only can find \"Mint\" the blue one which colors my gums. If you can find Clean Cinnamon, buy it. I have great checkups and my Dentist even tells me that."
5.00,"kept my breath fresh minty and my teeth look whiter"
4.00,"After using this toothpaste for a couple of weeks, my teeth look and feel cleaner. Close to what they feel like when leaving the dentist's office. I also like the taste as it is not too strong."
4.00,"This toothpaste had a great taste and we liked it."
5.00,"I love this toothpaste! It leaves my teeth feeling extra clean. The taste is great, my whole family loves it. Its our new toothpaste."
5.00,"I love the bristles which keep plaque away even for my little ones who don't brush as well as they should. Thank you!"
4.00,"This product was great because of its smoothness. I've used brushes with really bad bristles and feel like sandpaper. This one is great!"
4.00,"this was good toothpaste, but I'm not sure how it's different from others.."
5.00,"Happy that toothpaste can make difference and that not always necessary to use white strips."
5.00,"My Dentist recommending using this after brushing and I really like the results. Great taste, leaves you with a \"cleaner\" feeling in your mouth and knowing you have added protection. I recommend Crest Pro-Health for daily use!"
2.00,"I've been using this for a few days, and while I haven't noticed any staining to my teeth, the weird taste is a HUGE problem. My entire mouth feels like I've been sucking on nails and the taste will not go away. The taste is very metallic and it's disgusting. I ate a meal after brushing my teeth to try and get rid of the taste, and it came back once I was finished. My tongue has a tingling sensation and I used the mouthwash over an hour ago. I'm not sure what the deal is but I don't feel safe using this mouthwash anymore, especially after reading some of these reviews. Did they not test this stuff?!? I'm calling them for a refund!"
4.00,"It does make my mouth feel clean. It has a strong taste, so you know it works."
4.00,"Pretty good product, not sure if I'd actually pay full price for it though"
4.00,"i will deffinately buy it again, has a great taste"
4.00,"I loved the toothpaste - it was working and I could tell the difference in my plaque problem."
5.00,"I love this Clean Cinnamon Pro-Health toothpaste from Crest (The toothpaste itself is what I rate 5 stars). I would give Amazon 1 star for their pricing of it, though. I can only get it online, probably because it is not the most popular with many people. Anyway, the price has been steadily rising on Amazon (as have the prices on almost all of their goods), and of note the prices of Amazon-fulfilled, Prime-eligible options are INFLATED! This toothpaste has inflated to $5.24 per 6oz tube. Ridiculous! It is currently available on the Proctor and Gamble eStore for $4.00 per 6oz tube, and they offer free shipping if you buy more than $25 worth of goods (which is 7 tubes). This price beats the best available price on Amazon by $1.24 per tube for Amazon Prime members!"
5.00,"I was looking for a anti-plaque rinse that does not sting and this just fills the bill. My dentist recommended it-- I had been using a fluoride rinse out of habit since high school- and it is very convenient to be able to get this and some other monthly home supplies delivered by Amazon."
5.00,"I love this toothpaste! I won't be using any brand other than Crest in the future!"
2.00,"I've been using this mouthwash for about 2 weeks straight now, bought it instead of the normal Crest Pro Health Complete mouthwash because I thought the word \"Clinical\" would mean that it was in fact better for your mouth. While I have not experienced some of the more severe symptoms others have listed on this site, like the burning sensation in mouth and loss of taste, I can tell you that it leaves a residue in your mouth than cannot simply be rinsed out. After using, I have to rinse my mouth out a dozen or more times to clear it of the white foam that sticks to your tongue and sides of mouth like glue. Even rinsing that many times, I still end up with white in my mouth, and it disgusts me. No mouth wash has ever left stuff in my mouth other than a fresh feeling. This comes with dry mouth, and a whole lot of sticky white spit. Someone mentioned there is Hydrogen Peroxide in it which causes the white foamy stuff in your mouth. I use Hydrogen Peroxide to rinse my mouth from time to time, and I can promise you, with a few flushes of water through the mouth all the peroxide leaves with the water. This mouthwash does not. Do not buy, would not recommend, stick with the normal Crest Pro Health Complete mouthwash, or use something different entirely. I'm now going to shoot Crest an e-mail and see if they'll refund my money, or at the least provide me with a coupon or voucher for their normal mouthwash. This stuff is more expensive, and it's worse. Doesn't seem right to me. EDIT: 7-26-13: I did in fact contact Crest complaining about this product. Here is their response: Thanks for contacting Crest, Justin. I'm sorry about your experience with the Clinical Rinse and appreciate your reporting it to us.

5.00,"Thank goodness for Crest's cinnamon flavor, the refreshing way it makes me feel, and the fresher breath my wife appreciates too."
3.00,"Great price compared to local drug store, when you order through subscribe & save. However, we didn't like this toothpaste flavor at all."
1.00,"I did not like the gel toothpaste.It did not leave your mouth feeling clean.I had to rebrush my teeth using a different tootpaste each time"
5.00,"Great product! I would definitely recommend this to anyone!"
4.00,"Just wanted to review this product to say that I haven't suffered from my mouth peeling or having brown stains on my teeth.  My teeth are as white as they've ever been (not whiter because of the toothpaste) and my dental check-ups/cleanings have been positive.  I use this along with flossing and brushing with a Soniccare toothbrush, so who knows if it really works or not though...                                                                     I've been using this product for about 6 months now.                                                                     I'd like to add that it DOES make breath smell nice for some time and has a pleasant (gentle/non-harsh) feel while using. This is why I'll give it a 4 out of 5."
3.00,"I like trying new and improved toothpaste. The Crest Pro Health toothpaste is a great tasting tooth paste and it also cleaned my teeth very well. Often times the toothpaste can have a taste that is not too pleasing especially when it fights several different issues. The Crest Pro Health toothpaste really does help to fight plaque a little longer than your average toothpaste. I wouuld also like to see some other things added to the toothpaste to make it more appealing for me to purchase it. I know that it fights plaque very well but, I would like it to also have a good whitening agent, different flavors and gel and paste forms. Overall I like the Crest Pro Health line of dental care products."
4.00,"This product left my teeth feeling clean throughout the day! Some toothpastes, I feel like I have to rebrush a few hours later, but I was still feeling nice and fresh!"
1.00,"I am no longer using this toothpaste as the new caps do not close once they are opened. I woke up one morming to find that half the tube had leaked all over the counter. This is the second time I have complained about this and this is the last time I use Crest. After 40 years, I will be switiching brands because I cannot stand the design of the cap. Very wasteful and I would like my money back."
4.00,"I loved the rinse! It left my mouth feeling clean, even overnight, but wasn't harsh like other similar products I've used."
5.00,"This mouthwash made my entire mouth feel fresh and clean for hours! I love it!"
4.00,"The toothpaste works really well. My teeth felt really smooth. I just wish that it was cinnamon. I really don't like mint."
4.00,"Overall I'm satisfied with the toothpaste. Mouth feels minty fresh!"
4.00,"This rinse will leave your mouth with a fresh taste. It gets the job done, but I don't particularly enjoy the foamy-ness of the ProHealth Clinical. I much prefer the regular ProHealth Rinse over this one."
5.00,"I have to say...I'm impressed with this toothpaste. It left my teeth feeling super clean and fresh. I'll be buying this again!"
5.00,"I was already a loyal user of Crest, but had not tried the Pro-Health version yet. When I tried the sample of it that I received from Vocalpoint, I fell in love! What I like about it is how it makes your teeth feel so smooth and clean."
2.00,"cons: this mouthwash tastes awful. it doesn't taste fresh and it is very frothy. i couldn't wait to rinse it off with water. also, i think it's a bit expensive. pros: it doesn't burn, and didn't bother my sensitive teeth. bottomline: not for me!"
4.00,"Feels great, leaves mouth feeling clean when used before bed and in the morning."
4.00,"While I usually do not like any type of mouth wash, not only because of the sting and taste, but also because I feel as if it does last longer than five minutes after you use it. I feel very differently about this product. The mouth wash itself still has the sting but the taste is okay, and it actually leaves your mouth feeling clean till write sometime after use. I use it once in the morning and once at night, and I can notice a huge difference in the way my mouth feels in the morning. I does not feel all dirty and smelly."
4.00,"My son is a big fan of this toothpaste and he's very picky! I'm pickier, though, and prefer something like Tom's of Maine."
5.00,"tried it & like it! and it really matters to me that my teeth are being protected better now. nice flavor too, clean & fresh"
4.00,"Made my mouth feel clean and REALLY fresh. I would definitely recommend."
5.00,"This product cleans your mouth well and leaves it feeling fresh. Your teeth feel squeeky clean."
5.00,"I have noticed recently that lots of the really good for your teeth toothpastes do not leave you with that minty fresh feeling after brushing. I have no idea why they can't combine that minty freshness with the active ingredients they are touting. I am thrilled to say that the Crest Plaque Control does BOTH. My teeth had that nice smooth feel that they get after the dentist cleans them and I still felt like I had nice clean minty breath. The best of both worlds FINALLY!"
5.00,"I love crest products especially the whitening line. This mouth wash left me feeling fresh without that gross medicinal taste most mouth washes have."
5.00,"Crest is the only line I use It leaves my teeth clean and fresh. Easy to get my kids to brush!!!"
1.00,"As was true for some other reviewers, my teeth looked brown soon after I started using this rinse. There also were the purple clumps noted in other reviews."
5.00,"I absolutely loved the crest pro health toothpaste and pro health mouthwash. It made my mouth feel extremely clean like getting a cleaning from the dentist. Love all the Crest Pro Health products."
5.00,"Left my mouth with a fresh from the dentist clean. Loved the product and have already recommended to friends and family."
1.00,"Wow.  Bought this stuff and after a few minutes I started to get the most horrible, awful taste in my mouth.  This lasted for several hours.  I've also tried the blue stuff (also Crest Pro Health) and it was just as bad.  Seriously though, it produced an aftertaste that resembled hairspray.  It really is that bad...no kidding.  There's a number on the back of the bottle with instructions to get your money back if you send in the UPC and receipt.  I highly suggest you do this (like I did) so Crest will get the message and take this awful product off the market!!                                                                     Seriously, Crest...did you people actually TEST this stuff on humans before you released it for sale to the general public???"
4.00,"First off, I've been a long time user of P&G's Pro Health line of dental products. I wanted to give the Pro Health Clinical line a try after looking at the differences, namely a higher concentration of disinfectant. I was pleasantly surprised by this toothpaste. It has a satisfying gritty texture, a smooth mint taste, and left my mouth feeling smooth like after a dentist cleaning. I can't believe all I did was brush my teeth.I've deducted a star off this review because the quantity is misleading. This is 8 ounces of toothpaste total, a 4x2 oz package."
5.00,"This toothpaste is great! It left my mouth feeling clean and fresh. I'll definitely buy it again!"
5.00,"I let my daughters pick out their own toothpaste so I've used more brands and types than I can count. This time my 9 yo grabbed this tube only in the 5.8 ounce size. I tried it and love it. I only used Crest Pro-Health Clinical Plaque Control Fresh Mint Toothpaste for over a month and I wake with a clean fresh mouth in the morning, any puffiness in my gums has gone away, and after brushing my mouth never felt cleaner. This toothpaste does what it claims to do and out of all the different toothpastes I've tried, this one tastes the best."
5.00,"I absolutely love this product. After brushing, I have that awesome clean teeth feeling that you have after a professional dental cleaning! Highly recommend."
4.00,"this is far and away the best toothpaste i've ever used. i found it too be expensive, so i'm not sure i'll buy it regularly, but it is definitely a superior product!"
4.00,"This product leaves teeth feeling very clean. There is no gritty feeling like some toothpastes have. Like the added sensitivity aspect since I do experience that."
3.00,"It did what it is was supposed to do. Head of toothbrush was pretty large- that's a plus."
3.00,"I don't feel like it was phenom. but it got the job done"
4.00,"This is a pretty good toothpaste with a good flavor / taste. It does feel a little gritty vs. a smooth kind of toothpaste, but it isn't annoying. I see all of the negative reviews about peeling gums or numbness for this particular toothpaste, but that was not my experience at all. I have mixed emotions on the packaging, primarily the flip-top cap cover for the toothpaste. If you are using it in a fixed location (i.e., not traveling) it's great because I don't have to worry about having a screw-top cap slipping out of my fingers or falling off the sink. I learned the hard way this week do not travel with it, even in a Ziploc bag, as the cap doesn't stay on very firm and will leave a big mess! As I write this review, a pack of 4 tubes of this toothpaste is $13.88 which is comparable to my local Wal-Mart and saves me a trip in the car. If you like Crest toothpaste, I would recommend this one."
5.00,"I really loved this mouth rinse! It was refreshing and cleansing. Hopefully, after regular use my smile will also become much brighter!"
4.00,"I tried it and it worked well, the flavor was good. The price was average!"
5.00,"My family and I love pro health mouth rinse..I can not use a rinse that burns and this one is a no burner...It leaves your mouth fresh and clean for hours.. This is the only rinse we will use in our household!! Thanks pro health for an amazing product !!!"
5.00,"Loved how clean and fresh my teeth were after I used this - this will be the only toothpaste in my cabinet from now on."
5.00,"I really like the mouth wash it made my mouth feel fresh and the bad breath go away!!"
5.00,"I love the taste and how fresh CrestPro makes my breathe feel. It works great to control plaque buildup and helps with those between visits to the dentist for cleaning."
5.00,"This toothpaste is great. I really feel like it gets my whole mouth clean. Goodbye leftover plaque! Hello dentist clean teeth!"
5.00,"Before the rest of my review, I have to say I have not experienced any burning or mouth sores or swelling. I was surprised to see all these negative reviews about this, since it has not happened to me. Yes, it foams, but that is because it has hydrogen peroxide in it, which is there to kill bacteria. It alters the taste of food for me only very temporarily, for about an hour, but that's not much different than when I use any other mouthwash. Otherwise, nothing has changed about my tastes for food. Okay, now for my positive experiences: I have been using this about three weeks now and am very impressed. Before using this product, I tried everything to keep my teeth clean for more than a few hours, including special toothpastes and using an expensive electric toothbrush and brushing after lunch (no time most days). Results were the same; by mid-day I started to have a lining of fuzzy plague building up on my teeth along the gumline that was hard to remove, even with my electric toothbrush.  And the dental hygenist always spends a lot of time removing plague from my teeth every 6 months. Since the fist day I used this product, I have not had even a speck of plaque, that I can feel, building up on my teeth.  I don't even use it in the evening most days, just mornings, and I still don't have plague buildup.  In fact, once I forgot to brush my teeth one day because I was busy with the kids, and by that night I STILL did not have the fuzzy plague buildup near the gumline! I've noticed I don't have to brush my teeth as long anymore, either, more like the recommended time (2 minutes) instead of 10 minutes (not good for the teeth). I wish I could let my kids use it, but it is not for kids under 12. The only thing I don't like, but I can tolerate, is the foaming action of the hydrogen peroxide. Kinda grosses me out, but it's a fair price to pay for healthy teeth. If you are not sensitive to this mouthwash (apparently some are), I highly recommend this product. I know I'm looking forward to my next dental visit!"
1.00,"Cool.  Brown stains in between my teeth.  Thanks Crest.  Now I have to shell out money for trip to the dentist.  Hopefully they can remove the stains.  Please inform me if a class action lawsuit happens."
3.00,"I liked the freshness and feel while using, but the after taste did not work for me. Nothing could remove the after taste and it was not pleasant for me. However, no one else in my family had that issue, so I think I may have been an isolated occureence..."
5.00,"My mouth had a really clean and fresh feeling. I will continue to use Crest and Oral B in the future to get that feeling all the time."
5.00,"Good for gum disease, it is a fine toothpaste.I approve, & the price is a good deal, if not a great one.Remember to floss! :DThe Hipster gives it a Thumbs Up!"
1.00,"do not buy~!~ turned my teeth brown..... since i dont have dental insurance I have been taking extra good care of my teeth. When i saw this line i bought the whole thing...... thinking I was doing the best i could! NOPE, turned my teeth brown!!! DO not buy..... I cant afford to go have my teeth whitened so now I am stuck with brown nasty teeth.........."
4.00,"This toothpaste has a nice taste and does well cleaning my teeth. I usually use Sensodyne because my teeth are sensitive but the Crest has a better taste."
5.00,"I LOVE this paste, especially for my tweens, I know they do not brush as they should and I feel much more comfortable when they use Crest prohealth products, actually, any Crest product!"
5.00,"My teeth felt super clean compared to other toothpastes I've used. It taste better than adding baking soda to my routine."
5.00,"love the toothpaste and mouth wash havent tried the others yet"
2.00,"My mom used to send this stuff to me in college because she had some fond memories of crest products (I guess). I always hated it. It cleans okay but feels like sandpaper and is way too expensive compared to their competitors. Heck, I could grab a tube of ultrabrite and it'll do a better job at cleaning for 1/4 of the price. People say dentists recommend this toothpaste all the time...my dentist said to use colgate total. Whenever I walk into a retail store there's a wall of this stuff and it doesn't seem to sell (even when on sale). I'm not sure why they don't discontinue this line altogether. Heck, even the conventional crest is much better than this stuff; the \"with scope\" line is excellent at cleaning. I've been waiting for a sale to try the crest with citrus scope toothpaste...still it's more expensive than colgate total which makes zero sense to me."
2.00,"CREST PRO-HEALTH COLLECTION KIT Crest Pro-Health Healthy Fresh Toothpaste Crest Pro-Health Multi-Protection Refreshing Clean Mint Mouthwash Crest Pro-Health All-in-One Medium Toothbrush Oral-B Glide Pro-Health Deep Clean Floss Well first off the mouthwash Crest Pro-health Multi-Protection Alcohol Free, Clean Mint. Was reading on Amazon on that product's page that it can stain your teeth ... if this is the case that is ludicrous! Haven't finished a whole bottle yet .. But I will be paying attention! So I'm terrified to try anything other than a small swish. Other products by other manufacturer's I don't believe solely use the ingredient Cetylpyridinium Chloride which Crest had put the teeth staining possibility in very small print right above the UPC barcode. Best to read up here: Crest Pro-health Multi-Protection Alcohol Free, Clean Mint/Clear Mint (Package may vary), 1-liter Bottles (Pack of 3) Went to use the toothpaste ... it uses stannous fluoride, oh boy! Looked up this version of fluoride as opposed to sodium fluoride once again a warning right on the package says: \"May produce surface staining of the teeth.\" Any simply search on the web on the dangers (and benefits) of various forms of fluoride will bring up some strange & also scary stuff! - I tried a small amount of mouthwash - it did have some \"sting\" to it, and followed up with the tooth paste. Again, I used very small amounts after reading all the horror stories. Oh, dear the insanity. Now let's move on to the humble manual toothbrush, though I have switched to an Sonicare electric toothbrush (after my hygienist told me it is the greatest thing since aged cheddar cheese ... or something like that). Product Description: \"Tight spaces are the easiest places for plaque to build up--and the toughest to clean, since straight-bristle toothbrushes struggle to reach them. But CrossAction Pro-Health CrissCross bristles attack plaque from the perfect angle--an optimal 16̊--cleaning better than straight ones. Plus, Pro-Health's tongue cleaner helps remove germs from the tongue.\" Overall this seems to be a safe and effective toothbrush.\" Last but not least Oral-B Glide Pro-Health Deep Clean Floss. I had been reading that smooth \"gliding\" dental floss is too smooth and doesn't \"hold\" much debris between the teeth ... makes sense. Best to try a variety of flosses to see what works for you. I can't recommend this kit - NOT with all the teeth staining talk. I guess if you trust your dentist, try to find out what they use!"
4.00,"Toothpaste tastes great and my mouth really feels clean."
1.00,"My dental hygienist gave me a sample of this product 3 months ago to protect against gingivitis. Within 2 weeks, I began to get a constant slimy, mucousoidal film forming in my mouth after brushing. Concomitantly, I developed a lingering sore throat and hay fever symptoms which seemed to linger. I chalked this up to all the \"blooms\" of summertime and figured that the mucousy film was a symptom of environmental allergies. Along with the allergy-like symptoms, I started getting dark brown staining between my teeth. I have a full mouth of veneers and crowns, so I chalked up the staining to coffee stains between the veneers on the small portion of real tooth which isn't covered by the veneers. I stopped drinking my morning cafe con leche and went to my hygienist for another cleaning wherein she spent a half hour scrapping in between my teeth to get the stains off. She then pointed out to me that I had pitting on my veneers and crowns which wasn't apparent 2 months prior and asked me how I was brushing my teeth. I told her that I'm still using an Oral B motorized toothbrush and this toothpaste. She was baffled, called the dentist in who asked the same Q, and he basically said to lay off the coffee (though I protested that 1 cup a day should not have caused all that staining). I went back to using this product until I noticed this morning a sudden onset of gum recession about every tooth in my mouth. I freaked out, went online to WebMD where I couldn't find anything, then Googled my symptoms and voila found an entire Consumer Affairs forum discussing everything which happened to me. I have stopped using this product and have gone back to Aim. My dentist is seeing me next week, but wasn't hopeful on the phone about any gum recession \"reversing\" itself. I am beside myself especially since I spent 30k on cosmetic dentistry almost 4 years ago (20 veneers and 4 crowns) and now it looks as if I may have to redo all this work again or walk around looking like someone who has never brushed her teeth. My gums are ruined, my dental work is pitted and discolored, and what portions of my real teeth still exist (only the fronts of the teeth are covered by veneers) are tan. This is a disaster! IF YOU HAVE THIS PRODUCT, DISCARD IT AND GO BACK TO SOMETHING SIMPLE LIKE AIM GEL OR BAKING SODA!!!! I will be taking legal action for the damage done to me by this product!"
5.00,"Just what I was looking for, a toothpaste that would help my aging gums. I love the smooth texture and taste and of course the fresh feeling of clean teeth."
5.00,"I enjoyed the new Crest, it had a pleasant flavor and kept my teeth feeling clean all day . I would recommend this product."
5.00,"The mouth wash made my mouth feel fresh and clean."
4.00,"I liked it. I would choose this product over others. My husband loves the way it makes his teeth feel in the morning when he wakes up after brushing them at night. Th only thing I would say that can be improved is a little bit more of a kick in the taste. I like that hot super clean feeling after brushing my teeth and it wasn't quite there for me with this toothpaste. But still an overall great product that I would buy again and reccomend."
4.00,"Mouthwash kept my mouth feeling clean and fresh longer! Another great product from Crest!"
5.00,"my teeth felt very clean and refreshed after using. didn't dry my lips out."
5.00,"I love how clean my mouth felt after brushing my teeth with Crest Pro-Health Clinical Plaque Control. The fresh mint freshens your breath without the burning sensation you sometimes get from other toothpastes on the market which is great for those that need a sensitive toothpaste. Loved this toothpaste."
5.00,"I like how my teeth feel after using this toothpaste for several days. My mouth feels clean and I think that my teeth look whiter. The product is more expensive than other brands but if continues to brighten my teeth I think I would be inclined to purchase it again."
5.00,"Crest Clinical Rinse is great. it left my mouth feeling fresh and clean as if I just left the dentist from getting my teeth cleaned!"
1.00,"I bought this product because it was the only mouth rinse at the store that didn't contain Cetylpyridinium chloride, which yellows my teeth very badly. After rinsing with this Crest rinse twice, my entire tongue felt like it had been burnt on hot coffee. Food no longer tasted the same, and I was starting to freak out! I decided to search online and see if anyone else had experienced these same things, and... here I am on Amazon where everyone else is complaining of the EXACT same difficulties! Why is this product on store shelves?? DO NOT BUY THIS CRAP!"
5.00,"Really made my teeth feel clean and smooth. Actually feels like going for a cleaning at the dentist!"
1.00,"Needless to say, I was lucky enough to be blessed with great dental health my entire life. About 2 months ago I decided to change my regular mouthwash in order to try something new, just to figure out if I can get better results. Usually before purchasing a product, I always read reviews in order to come to a conclusion wehther I should purchase a product or not. However, I work at CVS and this item was on a great sale so I decided to try it without having any knowledge as to what I should expect. Now, I have no shame in admitting that even on sale this was probably one of the worst purchases of my life, if not the worst. I did not want to write a review right away because I wanted to experience the product first over a long period of time. This product really does not have any positives. First of all the taste is awful, which isn't a big factor for me however I wanted to mention it for anyone who feels as if the flavor is important. While using the mouthwash, it does cause a lot of burning sensation but bearable. After rinsing, it leaves a lot of gooey residue inside your mouth which can be very disgusting. At first I thought I just had a defective product, after exchanging for a different one I experienced the same gooey substances after rinsing. The worst factor of this product is that after rinsing, it will leave a horrible after taste in our mouth and also it will ruin your taste buds for a long period of time causing everything you eat to be tasteless and unappetizing. While reading the bottle I realized this product states a warning that it might cause discoloration to your teeth......wait what? A product that is supposed to be good for your oral hygiene might actually cause you more harm. After reading the warning, I immediately threw away the product without having an second thought. I really do not like \"hating\" anything, however this product is absolutely trash and should be avoided by consumers. Hopefully my review has been helpful! if you have any question or comment please let me know! Thanks."
4.00,"I really liked this product. It was a little strong for my kids but my mouth tasted great a few hours later."
4.00,"I found this mouthwash to work great my mouth feels much cleaner than with my usual brand also has a pleasant taste."
4.00,"It is a great toothpaste, my teeth felt clean and refreshed"
5.00,"I really like hoe my teeth felt after using this product"
4.00,"I bought the clinical toothpaste and mouth rinse. I really like the toothpaste.The rinse tasted a lot like peroxide though.My mouth and teeth do feel cleaner after using these products. I would buy these products again."
4.00,"This is a great toothpaste. Leaves my mouth feeling very clean and keeps feeling that way."
4.00,"We have used Crest for decades, and only recently switched to Colgate due to the latter's lesser cost. Colgate does a good job. However, this toothpaste is a strong contender. Crest does a good job, and I have no difficulties of the sort others have described. My teeth just feel clean, and my breath fresh, after using this toothpaste. We also love mouthwash, which genuinely protects and rebuilds enamel, fights decay and plaque and protects gums. The real deal, without health-endangering alcohol."
3.00,"It taste too much like peroxide. Left a funny taste in my mouth."
5.00,"I love this product it gets my teeth white and leave my breath fresh. Awesome product"
1.00,"I grew up with Crest Products and always believed they were \"top of the line\" - last year I had tried the whitening rinse (contains peroxide) and it gave me horrible gastritis - threw it away, called the 800 number and promptly received a refund.  Now last week a bottle of this \"blue\" rinse made it's way into my household, not sure who bought it but it wasn't me, but I did use it for several days and now what do I have??? HORRIBLE GASTRITIS, stay away from these products they're apparently poison..."
4.00,"This really left my mouth feeling fresh & clean. I felt like I was making a great health decision in using this product!"
4.00,"I am happy with this product. The flavor was very good and my mouth felt clean after using this toothpaste."
4.00,"Great toothpaste. Leaves your mouth feeling very clean and fresh. There is no gritty feeling after you have rinsed, as I have experienced with some other brands"
5.00,"i have always liked crest and i can say i like it more now. i felt my teeth were taken care of and it makes me proud to smile more than usual. thanks!!!"
5.00,"I have used many different mouthwashes over the years, but none worked like this. I suffer from allergies, so I breathe through my mouth a lot when sleeping. I usually wake up with a very dry mouth and it feels like there is a coating on my teeth. I couldn't believe how fresh my mouth felt in the morning after using this mouthwash. I didn't feel like I had cotton in my mouth and my teeth felt smooth and clean!"
5.00,"Best toothpaste period!!!!!This is the only toothpaste my family uses.Thank you Crest :)"
5.00,"It lasted longer and didnt burn.the price was fair."
5.00,"Really liked the mouthwash on the way it keeps foaming after you have dis-guarded it. Taste is very pleasant would recommend to all family and friends."
3.00,"I like the way it cleaned my mouth but didn't like the taste very much."
5.00,"I love how clean my teeth feel after using this product."
5.00,"Always a Crest \"kid\" and my kids are Crest kids. This new product is great and I feel it really does what it's supposed to."
5.00,"I have gum problems and have used this product for some time. It sounds like from the Amazon reviews that others have had side effects. I have had good results with no side effects. It has worked very well for me and I am thankful that it exists. Highly recommend."
4.00,"I like Crest toothpaste, the only thing i can really say negative is that it may be a little to sweet. this can be good if you have little kids that don't want to brush but sometimes doesn't taste so good to me. teeth feel really clean"
5.00,"Clinical Mouth Rinse Love it! Makes my mouth feel very clean and tastes refreshing. I will definitely buy this!"
5.00,"I like the toothpaste. Good taste, good consistency. The results I see at the dentist in six months will be the determining factor, but since I enjoy using the product, hopefully that will pay off in the dentist's chair."
4.00,"Overall, I think this product brought good results. The only down side for me was that it tastes funny."
5.00,"Using this product made my teeth feel extra clean, and I felt like I just got out the dentist chair."
1.00,"Be very wary when using this mouthwash. I've been using it for about two months and I noticed brown stains on and in between my teeth. I was horrified, and finally found other people who had the same problem with the product. I will never use it again!"
5.00,"What a great product I really noticed a difference so much whiter and my teeth feel clean and smooth longer!"
4.00,"Teeth Sensitivity varies person to person : I always used sensodyne but switched to this brand a few years ago and it works better for me . Not to say sensodyne is bad but Crest PHS is just better for my teeth"
3.00,"I'm 52 and don't have any particular teeth problems, but I decided to try this toothpaste marketed to people over 50. It cleaned as well as any other toothpaste, and that's about the best thing I can say about it. It's an average toothpaste, and the marketing angle is just another gimmick."
5.00,"I have always been a fan of Crest, but when they came out with the new line of Pro-Health toothpastes and mouth washes I have to admit I was excited! My mouth really hasn't felt cleaner, and I look forward to my next dentist visit!"
1.00,"At first I thought this product was great. My breath was fresh and my teeth felt clean. After using this rinse for 3 days, I began to lose taste, my tongue turned white, and my tongue burned like heck. I was not aware it was the mount rinse that was causing this until I came to Amazon to read reviews. Sure enough, it was the mouthwash. After 2 days of not using the Pro-Health rinse, but tongue is healing. Hopefully I will regain my sense of taste. This product should not be sold. With enough use, I can see it causing permanent damage to the mouth and tongue."
5.00,"I really liked this product b/c it made such a big difference for my gums which tend to bleed a little more than I'd like. Its my new mouthwash!"
5.00,"This product does exactly what it states it will do. If you have seen the commercial it states that you have the feeling of just leaving the dentist and this product delivers. I have already recommended this product to friends and family because I was so happy with it. Don't hesitate to purchase this product!"
2.00,"I didn't really notice a difference from the crest pro health I use now. Kind of disappointed, however I love crest and will stick with it."
4.00,"This product really made my mouth feel clean and fresh, and didn't feel abrasive like some pastes can."
5.00,"I love how clean my teeth feel and the way they look too!"
4.00,"The product is an effective toothpaste however it does seem to work better than the other less expensive Crest products. Good but not great."
5.00,"I really enjoyed using Crest Pro-Health toothpaste. The flavor was excellent, and my teeth and mouth felt clean and fresh all day."
4.00,"I felt my teeth and gums were clean after using though I didn't notice any real whitening. I also felt that this was a little too foamy for me. Nice flavor though"
4.00,"I'll usually buy whatever name-brand toothpaste is on sale (e.g., Aim) but I've got to say that after using this for a few weeks, my teeth appear brighter and they truly feel cleaner. It's hard to explain, but it feels like there are tiny smooth particles in the paste that are actually scrubbing/cleaning off the plaque on my teeth, even near the gum-line. When I'm done, I can run my tongue over my teeth and they actually feel smoother. It also leaves a tingly, cool mentholated feeling along my gums. I was told by my dentist to use a toothpaste that specifically promotes its ability to fight/remove plaque along the gum-line and help prevent damage from gingivitis. This toothpaste actually says it can help repair damage from gingivitis after four weeks, so I'm giving it a try and will r4port back after my next dentist visit. Overall very happy with the product"
4.00,"After having used the same toothpaste for years I was surprised how much I liked this. This is my new favorite toothpaste and I don't think I will be buying any other brand from now on."
5.00,"I used the crest pro-health for me. My mouth and teeth looked so good and felt so clean.. I also used the Oral B floss picks and they were excellent and easy to use.. My whole mouth feels great! Thank you.."
4.00,"I love how fresh and clean my mouth feels!! Although it is a little pricey so I'm not sure I would buy this all the time (even though I would like to!)"
1.00,"I started using this toothpaste about three weeks ago. After my first use I noticed there was white, stringy, saliva in my mouth. I also had numb tongue and a burning sensation on my lips and the tip of my tongue. I did not at first associate this with the toothpaste, however, so I continued to use it. By the second week I was suffering from a burning sensation in my mouth, skin cells coming off my cheeks (that white stringy stuff) and a terribly dry mouth and throat. After a while I started having a sore throat and developed two sores, one on my lip and one inside my cheek. Finally it dawned on me that all of this had started when I began to use the toothpaste. I discontinued use about a week ago and all of my symptoms are almost completely gone. I continue to have a problem with dry mouth, but it seems to be getting better each day. I highly recommend that you DO NOT USE this toothpaste. It is clearly very dangerous and should be recalled. I did a search online and found many consumer complaints against this product. I am dismayed that they continue to sell it as it causes such serious side effects for many people."
4.00,"Made my teeth feel very clean, my mouth and gums were refreshed. great flavor. would recommend to friends, and will purchase again for my family."
5.00,"I am a smoker and avid Diet Cola drinker. I have upper dentures but my real teeth on the bottom. I used the Crest Pro Health with Plaque Control on both my real and false teeth. They felt and looked so clean and much whiter than before and I must admit even better than the popular denture cleansers that require soaking. Very impressed WTG Crest! Highly recommend!"
5.00,"after a few uses it left the clean feeling for a good while"
5.00,"Crest left my mouth feeling clean and fresh! The tasted lasted long and didn't leave my teeth feeling unclean. I love it and will be using this brand forever!"
5.00,"i haevnt been using the products long enough to know if they live up to their claims but they do feel like they are working, and they taste good too!"
5.00,"We loved the Prohealth Rinse. It left my mouth and teeth feeling much cleaner for much longer than anything else I've used. My husband agrees. We are happy to recommend."
5.00,"UPDATE: APRIL 10, 2012                                                                     One last time: There is absolutely nothing wrong with the product, if it there was the FDA and Proctor and Gamble would take the product off the shelves. The fact is that a small minority of people because of their body chemistry and condition of their teeth experience minor side effects such as staining of the teeth and a temporary loss of taste. I like millions of others who use this product, do not experience these side effects. End of story."
5.00,"I have used this product for over 2 years and it works great. Great gum report from dentist and no cavities!!!"
4.00,"I love that this toothpaste keeps your mouth feeling fresh and clean longer than the store brand. I keep an extra paste in my travel bag all the time!!"
4.00,"I can definitely see some difference in my teeth. They seem brighter than before. As for helping fight cavaties and plaque, won't know until my next check up."
4.00,"Crest Crest Pro Health Cool Wintergreen Mouth Wash is a mild tasting , alcohol free, mouth wash. I wouldn't describe the taste as great, but I like it much better than harsh mouthwashes that leave your mouth burning. Like another popular brand, Crest Pro Health Mouth Wash kills 99% of common germs that can cause plaque, gingivitis and bad breath. I like to use it between brushings for a quick freshen up. I recommend it."
5.00,"I loved the toothpaste, I've been using the Crest 3D white and loved it. When I started trying this plaque control I loved it as well! All the crest products are amazing and work exactly like they should."
4.00,"My biggest complaint with this toothpaste is that it didn't whiten my teeth. It doesn't claim to be a whitening paste, so I'm not docking points for that, but that is what I like to use and pretty much all that I buy. I liked the flavor and thought my mouth was fresh and clean. I also felt it was reasonably priced, and I enjoy Crest products. I would potentially buy this if it were on sale or I had a coupon, but in general, I prefer the whitening and will buy that instead. If you don't care about the whitening (I drink coffee and red wine pretty much daily so it's a biggie for me!) than I would highly recommend!"
3.00,"I tried this product even though it was a little expensive. I usually don't use mouthwash and this product will not make me change that. It made my mouth feel fresh for a short period, not worth the money spent on it."
5.00,"I really like Crest Products and this toothpaste is no exception. I especially like using it in conjunction with the Crest Pro-Health Clinical Rinse. Along with regular flossing, I think these products will really help with my overall oral health."
5.00,"Great taste, leaves my teeth feeling clean longer. the price is a little high for my budget most of the time. But with a great coupon it makes it more affordable."
5.00,"I tried the sensitve toothpaste and loved it! It's my new favorite. I like it better than Sensodyne."
4.00,"Love this toothpaste! Mild flavor with strong results."
4.00,"It leaves your mouth feeling really clean. The taste is a little strong but overall I love it."
5.00,"we always used listerine until now. tried it out, husband loved teh fresh taste we have made hte switch!"
4.00,"This had a great cleaning to it and left my teeth feeling refreshed."
4.00,"That said, hopefully Crest is working on a redesigned cap."
4.00,"I was excited to try this product and was pleased with the results. My teeth and mouth felt very clean after using all the samples!"
4.00,"i really liked this stuff. i bought a few of them for my family and my sisters. but the after taste was a bit bitter."
5.00,"i love this mouthwash .it has a nice flavor but it does burn a lil i thought it wouldnt because of the no alcohol but not too bad will be using this product again."
5.00,"My teeth and gums felt cleaner after several uses. I enjoy the fresh taste it leaves in my mouth."
2.00,"I've been using this toothpaste for a month now. I've been getting massive amounts of skin/film peeling from the inside of my cheeks. I had it rarely before but more recurrent when I started using this toothpaste. I didn't realize it was the toothpaste until my husband mentioned it might be the culprit. My mouth hasn't gotten sore or raw like the other reviews but the skin peeling is so inconvenient. It doesn't happen right away. In fact, after I brush, I completely forget that it does that and as I'm trying to sleep, I'm awakened by slime in my mouth. Not great to use if you plan on having a romantic night. It'll ruin goodnight kisses. Yuck."
3.00,"I was anxious to try this product, as I had read positive reviews about it. I personally did not like the taste and really feel it was worth the price I paid for it. Will not purchase it again."
5.00,"This mouthwash is excellent!!!!!!!! It does not burn and it taste great! I used the whole line of products and my teeth feel great. I even have my husband using the products as well."
5.00,"This Crest Pro Health cinnamon flavor is not easily found in stores. I'm glad Amazon carries it. If you dislike mint flavor, but still need a refreshing taste in your mouth when you brush your teeth, this toothpaste may be good for you. In addition, I was a Colgate Total customer for years, until my orthodontist recommended this one. WHAT a blessing! It cleans better, reduces tar build up and help with yellow teeth or some yellowing of your teeth. Please understand that my teeth (like 4-5 of them) were slightly yellow and not completely. If your teeth are completely yellow, I don't know if this will fully work for you. I can tell that my teeth are whiter and people can too."
5.00,"You can tell the toothpaste is still working after you finished brushing. I can feel and see a difference in my teeth."
3.00,"Wow this does job love a clean mouth and would tell others"
4.00,"This tooth paste was great! It kept my teeth feeling clean all day. I loved how it was so professional. The only draw back was the taste! I'm sensitive to taste and this flavor was not my favorite. Overall I would buy this again."
5.00,"First of all I love Crest Prohealth products due to the wonderful quality of the products, and the fact that they do what they promise. This product was no exception. Loved the flavor and that it polished my teeth perfectly, with no grainy leftover taste like a lot of toothpastes have. I have used this for about 2 weeks and I am very satisfied with the results, my teeth feel cleaner, smoother, and my mouth feels fresh. I highly recommend."
1.00,"I love crest but was not a fan Of this type. Won't buy again"
4.00,"Love the toothbrush! Left my mouth feeling extra clean and fresh."
1.00,"I picked up a bottle of Crest Pro-Health because the store was out of my regular non-alcohol mouth wash and I didn't have time to wait for an order from Amazon.  Within a few weeks, I noticed stains on my teeth.  My dentist confirmed that it was the mouthwash.  Fortunately, the dentist office was able to polish the stains off."
4.00,"Thank you for the opportunity to try out the Crest Toothpaste. I have always been more a fan of a different brand of toothpaste, but this sample may change things for me. I loved the feeling of clean, dentist clean teeth. There is nothing better, especially when you don't have the big price to pay for going to the dentist to get and keep that same clean feeling."
4.00,"I not only loved the taste, but I liked the way it left my teeth feeling squeeking clean. The freshness lasted several hours after brushing."
4.00,"I liked this product overall. It made my mouth feel very clean. It lasted quite awhile, longer than other mouthwashes that I've tried. I do think it was a little strong, though."
4.00,"It makes me feel my mouth is so much healthier when using this product."
5.00,"I'm a life-long Crest user with only one complaint: over the years my teeth & gums have suffered from increased sensitivity. Crest \"Pro-Health For Life\" is designed for the 50+ crowd. While touting its usual defense against \"cavities, gingivitis, plaque, tartar while whitening & freshening breath\" Pro-Health for Life is supposed to be specifically formulated for surface stains, weak enamel & the big selling point for me: Tender inflamed gums and tooth sensitivity. I'm not over fifty but I have been using this product for over a month now and I am very satisfied with the results. I feel that I am getting the same great quality I have gotten from other Crest toothpastes I have used, however this is one of the BEST for tooth & gum sensitivity. I am able to brush longer without discomfort & the light mint flavor is unoffensive and does seem to suffice for providing breath freshness. So to anyone who does suffer from tooth & gum sensitivity, please do not be put off from using this product just because you aren't 50 yet."
5.00,"I really like this product. Left me with a nice and clean smile."
4.00,"I tried the new Crest Pro Health Tooth Paste, and I noticed that my teeth were slightly whiter and my mouth feel cleaner. It only takes just a little tooth paste to get a good lather."
2.00,"It cleaned my teeth as well as other products but no better, and tasted bad."
5.00,"I loved the Crest Pro-health Clinical. It tasted great, my mouth felt cleaner longer and it is a toothpaste I would definitely buy."
5.00,"I absolutely love all Crest toothpaste. This one did not disappoint. Loved it and will buy again."
5.00,"It cleaned my teeth very well and my mouth was not burnt like other brands. Highly recommend to everyone."
4.00,"works great, even my son liked it, would buy it again."
5.00,"This mouthwash leaves my mouth feeling extremely clean. It's flavor tastes good, and you can just tell that it does it's job. It always leaves my breath smelling fresh after using it."
3.00,"And I'm not the only one... this is true for products that have in them including this product and                                                                                             You might wish to try this in a smaller purchase before a bulk purchase, as I found the side effect of this to be annoying. It uses something that causes slight peeling of the skin in my mouth. The only other product that does this and has a similar taste/texture in the mouth is Listerine Zero. This effect is not immediately obvious to me, but 30 minutes or so later I may find myself at work feeling like there is something in my mouth-- almost like a piece of wet tissue if you've ever had a tooth pulled or had gauze in your mouth. I put my finger in there to trace it out, and sure enough, it's a small wadded up piece of white peeled skin.                                                                     It's not bad enough to not use the product, but it is strange, and you can feel the entire texture of the mouth where the skin is going to peel feel dry and rough before it happens. Other than this one disturbing feature, the mouthwash does what it should, freshens breath, and otherwise works. Since I have no evidence that this happens to many people I have rated it 3 stars instead of 5, but if this is something everyone experiences, I'd probably rate it even lower.                                                                     My summary here is to try this in a small purchase first before committing to the bulk buy."
5.00,"I liked this product, and would use it again. It was a good price and did help my teeth and mouth feel cleaner."
5.00,"I loved it. Made my breath feel fresh and clean. I love all Crest products."
5.00,"I Loved this toothpaste, it was really minty and kept fresh breath for a very long time."
4.00,"Trying this toothpaste was well worth it. The taste is good and doesn't burn like some toothpastes can. After using it, my teeth really did feel much cleaner and less fuzzy in the harder to reach areas."
5.00,"I liked the way this toothpaste made my mouth feel clean and fresh."
1.00,"The toothpaste tastes awful. It makes me almost throw up every time i use it. It is not the same as the other Crest Sensitive toothpaste. I would avoid"
5.00,"works great. my teeth are very, very clean. i loved it."
4.00,"Love the product! It leaves my mouth fresh and I didn't mind the taste."
4.00,"This product has a good taste and no sting,but it does leave an aftertaste."
1.00,"Bought this Crest Pro-Health Plaque Control paste last week from Wal-mart. Start using it last weekend (Saturday night, Oct 25). On Sunday I start having tooth ache and I thought I caught cold or some infection in the tooth/gum that had to take Advil. I also notice skin inside of my mouth and lip was piling off. I was using it at night (in the morning I use Pro-Enamel paste). Last night my wife told me her teethes are also hurting. Only thing different we did was using this paste and we realized this paste is causing all the pain and extra sensitivity to our teeth. This morning I searched for review of this paste and found so many other people are also having same effect. How a well known company like Crest sell a paste that causes pain and sensitivity to teeth?"
5.00,"I actually looked forward to brushing as my mouth had a great feeling of long lasting clean"
5.00,"I tried Crest Pro Health toothpaste and love it! My teeth felt really clean and my breath was nice and fresh. I'll definately keep using it!"
5.00,"This mouthwash is fantastic! First, I am so glad that it is alcohol free. That alone makes me excited because my breath fresh lasts so much longer! The foaming action makes my mouth feel cleaner and my teeth look so much whiter too! I would definitely recommend this product! I love crest products and they just keep getting more personalized and greater!"
4.00,"It's a little hard to review this toothpaste based on it's clinical claims. Most of us see our dentist every 6mo at the most. The packaging states that it reverses gingivitis in 2 weeks, but how would you know other than a general sense that your gums are bleeding less and less inflamed? Still, I like the toothpaste and my family prefers the taste to any of the other gel toothpastes I have purchased recently. I'm guessing that the toothpaste itself makes less of a difference in gum disease than diligent and careful brushing, flossing and irrigating, but it can't hurt to have a toothpaste that has a pleasant, mild taste so brushing is more appealing."
4.00,"Would have to say that this Crest toothpaste leaves a great clean feeling in your mouth after having brushed your teeth. I would recommend this to friends."
5.00,"I really liked the fresh mint taste, without the burning sensation of some other rinses. My mouth felt very clean and fresh after using."
5.00,"My dentist recommended this to me also. I try to use it a least once daily. I've had good dental check-ups since."
4.00,"My mouth felt good for hours afterwards. I still woke up with bad breath though that my husband did not appreciate. :) It has a strong \"taste\" but not too bad for me. Too strong for my 8 year old though."
5.00,"My whole family really liked it. Will continue to purchase."
4.00,"It does what is says it does. Not my normal brand but I will be purchasing this product..."
5.00,"Crest Pro-Health Multi-protection Clean Mint Rinse is a perfect mouth wash for those with sensitive teeth and gums. For years the only mouth wash you can buy was ones that would burn your gums whilst rinsing and gargling. But for the past few years, Crest Pro-Health has been making mouth washes that do not make you endure the unpleasant burning sensation that most dental rinses have. The Clean Mint Rinse not only doesn't bring the pain with each use, but it'll protect your teeth and gums for twenty-four hours. So, if you are looking for some additional oral protection and need some extra help in your war against tooth decay then you'll need to get yourself a bottle of Crest Pro-Health Multi-Protection Clean Mint Rinse today."
4.00,"My family always uses crest toothpaste and the new pro health is wonderful. I know I can count on crest to keep my teeth looking and feeling like I just stepped out of the dentist chair. Thanks!"
1.00,"I used this mouth rinse for the first time two days ago.  Despite the \"no alcohol\" labeling which implied no burning, I immediately noticed a few spots in my cheeks and gums that burned while I was rinsing.  The worst issue, though, was that for the rest of the day I had an awful taste in my mouth, and I was unable to taste anything that I ate or drank.  I used it again the next morning, thinking it must be a fluke.  Again, I could not taste anything all day long.  I have not used the rinse since yesterday morning, and I still have a slight tatse in my mouth and still some loss of taste when eating or drinking.                                                                     I contacted the company through their website and received a response quickly, but it only contained the copied and pasted answers from their FAQs, which I had already read.  They did give me a number to call (1-866-695-1856) if I had experienced these issues, and I plan to call them today to complain.  I will also be getting my $5 back, per the refund statement on the bottle.  There is a warning on the bottle about the staining issue, which I have not had. However, there is NO warning on the label about the effects on the tongue and taste.  Shame on Crest for continuing to sell a product with such awful side effects!                                                                     Their website does say that the effects will go away once you stop using the product.  However, I do not think I should have to choose between using a mouthwash or being able to taste food!  They need to rethink the \"6 health benefits\" and add \"appetite suppression\" as a benefit. It could be the next big weight loss product . . ."
5.00,"Left my mouth feeling very fresh and clean, would definitely buy again!"
5.00,"i loved the extreme clean and fresh feeling without the burn. a little bit of a strong aftertaste but I think that is why it keeps your mouth feeling fresh longer."
5.00,"Thank You Vocalpoint...I was able to try Crest Pro-Health Clinical Plaque Control Toothpaste. LOVED it so much I am switching to this product. Gingivitis runs in our family...a herady thing...I am borderline and want to keep ahead of the good teeth and gum game! So important to overall health."
3.00,"I liked that it wasn't too strong, but for the price, I don't think there's anything that sets this product apart from others."
4.00,"Really liked this product, teeth felt clean...a little on the higher cost side."
5.00,"I tried the Clinical Rinse. It makes your whole mouth tingle and makes you feel like you just left the Dentist's office. I would definately recommend this to all my friends."
5.00,"I used it after it was recommended by my dentist. It definitely leaves my mouth feeling clean and fresh. I am sure it is helping keep the plaque and other issues in control with daily use."
4.00,"I liked the product very much. I really enjoyed the flavor. It tasted \"clean\". It made my teeth feel very clean."
5.00,"It always keeps my teeth and mouth fresh and clean"
2.00,"Didn't think I'd ever be reviewing a toothpaste on Amazon, but here goes.                                                                     I bought a four-pack of this toothpaste sight unseen at a local membership superstore, not knowing anything about its reputation.                                                                     I began using it, and noticed a number of things right away. First off, it isn't as pasty as your typical toothpaste. It feels heavier than regular toothpaste, and it oozes slightly out of the tube, like I need to keep the top upright or else it's going to pour out. That was a little weird. It also makes the tip of my tongue tingle as I'm brushing, and it lingers for a while afterward. That was weird, too. It doesn't taste very minty, either. In fact, it doesn't taste good at all.                                                                     But worst of all, when I'm done brushing and rinsing (and I rinse well), it leaves a terrible, chemical aftertaste in the mouth that lingers for hours. And that isn't weird, that's unpleasant. I get a strong craving for a sweet drink sometime after brushing with this toothpaste, and that isn't at all the kind of thing I should be thinking about after brushing my teeth.                                                                     It got to the point where I was wondering if something was wrong, and I checked the reviews here on Amazon. It was good to discover I was not alone with my misgivings. A lot of the reviews mention stannous fluoride.  I never even knew there was such a thing as stannous fluoride. I thought fluoride was fluoride. So I learned more about it, and I'm convinced that stannous fluoride is the future of toothpaste fluoride. I was ready to pitch this toothpaste in the trash and move back to my old Crest Tartar Control toothpaste, but I can't discount the advantages of stannous fluoride (which is also, apparently, prevalent in mouthwashes).                                                                     The best thing I can say about this toothpaste is that it probably leaves my teeth cleaner than any toothpaste I've ever used. My mouth does have a palpably clean feeling after using it, and that is significant.                                                                     So I will bear down and keep using it, albeit grudgingly. The bad aftertaste is its major weakness. I will never love this toothpaste until it tastes as pleasant and clean as the gel toothpastes I know and love. Crest had better improve it in a hurry, or else the drawbacks of this product will wear me down."
5.00,"In the end, remember, this is toothpaste. It isn't that glamorous. However, that doesn't meant that buying such a mundane product isn't that important. When I first ordered this toothpaste, I didn't realize that it was formulated for users over 50. I'm not quite there yet. Even so, I'm glad I ordered this product. There are several reasons. First, this is an all in one product. It does everything from whiten your teeth to helping you prevent gingivitis. Second, regardless of your age, this is an excellent choice because it really does get your teeth really clean. Also, it will definitely protect your teeth and gums from sensitivity. In fact, if numbness bothers you, then you will probably want to only use a small amount of this toothpaste on your toothbrush. (I think I went overboard and used too much on my toothbrush, and it made my tongue somewhat numb.) I really liked the flavor. It's a fresh type of mint, similar to a spearmint, and again, it really made my mouth feel clean. If you want a great all in one toothpaste that not only protects your mouth and gets it really clean, this product will do it."
1.00,"My husband had started using this to improve his gums and teeth. One day my son looked at his teeth and said daddy your teeth are dirty. We became concerned that there was something wrong. After he went to the dentist and they found out he was using this mouthwash we discovered others were having the same problem. They were able to get his gums clean again but it takes a professional cleaning. I had noticed that after he rinsed with this it left particles in the sink that dried and was hard to get out. I guess the same thing was happening to his teeth."
5.00,"For years and years I have only used a different brand for mouthwash but I decided to give something else a try. Let me tell you - I'm glad I did. The taste wasn't overpowering and it left my mouth feeling fresh for a long time after I used it. I'll definitely buy this product again!"
5.00,"I tried the Crest pro health toothpaste. I really liked it. It left my teeth feeling clean and my mouth fresh."
4.00,"Use this product on a daily basis. Would recommend its use. The price is fair. Delivery was made within the period of time promised."
5.00,"I definitely am a toothpaste and mouthwash snob. I want the best tasting, strongest product that will leave my breath fresh, my mouth healthy and my smile happy. These products fit that bill!"
5.00,"teeth feel extra clean thanks to the gritty material in the toothpaste. wish it wasn't discontinued but bought enough to get me through"
5.00,"My girls love this toothpaste and we were not able to find it in stores--so glad to find it here!"
5.00,"awsome product! my mouth felt clean as if i went to a dentis"
5.00,"My teeth felt good after I brushed them felt nice and clean"
5.00,"I love this toothpaste, it makes my teeth so bright and clean."
4.00,"At first I thought the toothpaste flavor was too much but i quickly started enjoyong the refreshing aspect of it. Keeps my teeth squeaky clean. miss it having no whiteners."
4.00,"I was really impressed with this toothpaste. It made my teeth feel cleaner than with other products...actually that just been to the dentist clean. Very nice!"
5.00,"I love this toothpaste. The taste is great, I usually don't like cinnamon. But this tastes good. I don't have that film feeling in my mouth like the other people say they do. although I do when I wake up in the morning (no matter what toothpaste I used the night before). It does foam up alot but I LIKE that, and its good for you. I am an RN and all that foam better gets between teeth to kill plauqe causing bacteria. I have NEVER even heard of red streaks/stains. It sounds like lies or people being drama queens. I mean the ADA says this is the best toothpaste right now. I recommend this stuff highly, you feel cleaner."
5.00,"I liked the fact that this toothpaste is effective but does not have the strong medicine type taste."
5.00,"If you can effortlessly whiten your teeth by brushing your teeth or control plaque between dentist visits simply by brushing, who wouldn't? Well, that's what you can do with crest pro health products. From a name you can trust, with that being said, I thought crest pro health was a great product, great taste too."
1.00,"As a rule I never write bad stuff on products that I do not like. This is the one exception. I bought a bottle of this stuff mostly just to give it a try and since it said it was alcoal free. After the first day my month/tounge burned bad. Food tasted awful and the burning numb feeling lasted all day. Right off the bat I said this will be the last bottle I buy but figured I would just finish this one since I do not like to waste money. I lasted 4 days and could not take the effects of this crap anymore and dumped it down the drain. Even after I stopped using my mouth did not feel right for a few days. I went back to Scope with no problems at all. If you do not mind your mouth burning all day and food tasting bad then you will be fine with this product."
5.00,"I used to purchase only Crest Cinnamon. Now I have changed my ways. The tooth paste actually feels like it is cleaning. Great flavor too"
5.00,"I have always LOVED Crest! You have outdone yourself this time CREST! Another great toothpaste!"
5.00,"I loved it. FResh breath and clean teeth. I would recommend this product when buying tooth paste."
1.00,"In the description of the weight of the item it was listed as 12.5 ounces; however, the product is only 4.2 ounces. This is very overpriced for the size and grossly misrepresented in the product weight description."
5.00,"Crest Pro Health is recommended by my dentist. It is a great product and it really cleans my teeth."
4.00,"I love the way my mouth feels after using it, but I don't find anything unique about it."
5.00,"This is hte best toothpaste that I have ever used. We just love it. Boy does it clean well and it stays with you all day long. Highly recommended."
4.00,"Really enjoyed the mouthwash. I'm not normally someone who splurges on this - and it was well worth it!"
5.00,"Would recommend it. Nice taste and better than the usual toothpaste you buy at the supermarket.                           Sometimes I alternate it with a plaque reducing toothpaste."
5.00,"I bought this for my husband who has gingivitis and had to have his gums scraped. His check-ups after using this have been significantly better."
4.00,"This toothpaste was great in conjunction with the mouthwash. I really enjoy using it."
5.00,"We love this toothpaste - it's the one that always leaves our mouth the freshest for the longest amount of time.                           We were looking for it for a better price than the local supermarkets and pharmacies. I always have that slight fear of buying things like this online in case it's a &quot;counterfeit&quot; but sure enough, this pack of 4 was exactly what we were looking for. It's authentic, good price, sealed containers, and not expired dates.                           As a note about Amazon, it also arrived on-time and well-packed."
1.00,"As you'll read in other reviews, this toothpaste left a nasty, white mucus-like substance all over the inside of my mouth. Absolutely disgusting. I do not recommend this product to anyone."
5.00,"This toothpaste made me teeth feel so clean! I would definitely recommend it."
4.00,"I love this because there is no burn like most other mouthwashes and it leaves your mouth feeling fresh and clean!"
5.00,"This mouthwash was the greatest. Ive tried many other mouthwashes, but this one made my mouth feel so clean all day. I would reccommend this product to everyone."
5.00,"this stuff lasts a long time. great to use in the morning!"
5.00,"This is an amazing product. It has good taste and kept my teeth feeling clean for a long time."
5.00,"I love this mouthwash, it is the best I have found and it doesnt burn or have a major aftertaste. This is my favorite mouthwash."
5.00,"My husband and teenage son were the ones who used this and they loved it ... both thought it worked much better than the 2 or 3 brands that they had been switching between using ... even the other Crest Pro-Health rinse they'd used. Great stuff!"
5.00,"I like the other Pro-health products from Crest and this one did not disappoint. My teeth felt really clean and fresh. I will buy this product again."
4.00,"I have never been a huge fan of the pro-health line of toothpaste but my husband always says how much he loves it. Needless to say, we have our own tubes!"
5.00,"This toothpaste is great. I like how it makes my teeth feel after brushing."
4.00,"I love how this toothpaste leaves my mouth feeling fresh! I really trust the Crest brand, and this product hasn't let me down."
5.00,"Mouth feels super clean and whiter! Very easy to use."
4.00,"Overall my mouth feels clean after using this mouthwash.The foaming action gets into the nooks and crevasses of my mouth making it feel cleaner than a normal mouthwash. The taste is the only downfall. The initial taste is ok, but when spitting it out it tastes odd. I think part of it is the foaminess."
4.00,"I liked that this cleaned between my teeth without having to swish hard. But it didn't have the best taste and I didn't like how it stayed on my tongue. It was like rinshing with peroxide, which I noticed is a main ingredient! It does what it promised, and I did like the clean feeling, just not how the tasted stayed with me."
5.00,"I'm a loyal user of Listerine products, so the first thing I realized about the Crest Pro-Health Mint Rinse is that there's no bitter or memorable aftertaste. You use it and you're done. The \"clean mouth feeling\" is no different from Listerine. I will definitely buy this product in the store, if the price is comparable to what I'm already paying for Listerine."
3.00,"The product worked well and the after gargling it did not leave my mouth with that dry feeling after you get with most mouth washes."
1.00,"I won't go into detail because other reviewers have posted the same things here before: Pros: It doesn't taste like mint Cons: You won't be able to taste all day I think the cons far outweigh the pros."
5.00,"As always Crest has lived up to its name. Using this I felt like my teeth were clean and my breath was fresh. nice product. Will buy again"
5.00,"This mouthwash made my mouth & teeth feel really clean. It didn't burn like some mouthwashes do which is really nice. Will use again."
5.00,"It made my mouth feel clean and fresh for a long time."
4.00,"makes my teeth very clean and fresh. The only thing that I don't like is, it tastes like pepto-bismol"
4.00,"It makes your teeth and mouth feel really clean and fresh."
5.00,"My family has tried the toothpaste and we like it very much it seems to keep our teeth and mouth feeling great."
5.00,"Very refreshing and left my mouth feeling out of the dentist clean! Also at an affordable price!"
5.00,"I am a fan of Crest products and this one is exceptional. Your teeth and mouth feel very clean and fresh when using this product."
4.00,"This product left my teeth feeling clean and wonderful!"
5.00,"Fantastic product. I noticed my teeth are whiter after just a week. Tastes great and gets rid of even coffee breath."
4.00,"This toothpaste left my teeth feeling clean, but honestly I just don't like the way it tastes. It's a personal thing, but I just can't get over the taste enough to use it on a daily basis."
4.00,"Very convenient, mutli-tasking. Great taste. Makes my teeth feel clean. Makes me feel like I'm whiting them, too. Getting rid of the coffee stains and brightening my smile!"
5.00,"First of all, I LOVE trying new products! I thought the taste was great and my teeth surely felt squeaky clean!"
4.00,"Liked the fresh and long lasting mint taste and that the teeth felt smooth like after going to the dentist. Like that it reduces plaque and prevents gingivitis too."
5.00,"My mouth felt really clean after using this product. Great taste, no bad \"after-taste.\" Doesn't burn."
5.00,"This was a nice addition to the toothpaste on really making my mouth sparkle. Even alone it freshened my mouth nicely."
5.00,"It works like the other brands, like the fresh taste."
1.00,"I have had the same experiences as everyone else regarding the sloughing off of the lining of my mouth and the loss of taste. I also developed mumps-like symptoms. It hurt horribly to eat (guess it was fortunate I couldn't taste anyway). This has gone on for a week. I am going to flush it down the toilet. I think it will make a much better drain cleaner than a mouth rinse."
5.00,"My teeth feel so smooth and clean! I highly recommend this toothpaste."
4.00,"This toothpaste provided lots of freshness to my mouth and that nice clean feeling for my teeth. I do wish it had a whitening aspect to the paste as well."
5.00,"I really liked the crest pro health clinical toothpaste. It really cleaned my teeth and at my checkup my dentist noticed the improvement from using it."
5.00,"I love it, it works it tastes great and my mouth is fresh and clean"
4.00,"Cleaned my teeth well, it's a toothpaste, what more can I say...."
5.00,"So now I'm offically back to using Crest products! I guess my Mom knew best after all! :-D"
4.00,"The Crest Pro-Health Toothpaste really left a clean feeling in my teeth. I'm ready to change from my current toothpaste!!!! Thank you!"
5.00,"I love Crest Pro Health toothpaste. I've been using it for approx. 1 month and definitely see a difference in how white my teeth appear. Great tasting also...makes my mouth feel very fresh!"
1.00,"This toothpaste left a bad taste in my mouth, along with that film that I have to constantly pull from my lips or the gum line. I do like the regular crest pro health, but I am realizing that it, too, leaves that film. I will be looking for a new toothpaste."
4.00,"I was surprised on how well the Crest toothpaste tasted. Left no funky after taste and left my teeth feeling clean!"
1.00,"I used this product for about a month after my hygienist suggested I use a fluoride rinse. One day, after an important job interview, my 10 year old son says to me, Mom, you've got raisins in-between your teeth. I looked in the mirror and saw that there were dark black and brown stains (not raisins) between my teeth. Couldn't scratch it off with my fingernail, brushing or rubbing with a cloth! It was horrifying. I looked like a life long smoker or maybe tobacco chewer. For the record, I don't do either of those things. An occasional coffee drinker is my worst vice. I hadn't changed any of my regular patterns during this time. I'm 100% convinced it was the mouthwash. I just paid out of pocket cash for my hygienist to clean them (since my insurance only pays every six months for a cleaning and I could not wait until then to get those stains off). Crest phone support was lame and read me a canned statement with no satisfaction. I hope this doesn't happen to you."
5.00,"I love the way this product works! It tastes great and makes my mouth feel fresh and clean for hours."
5.00,"i loved this product not to strong but cleans really well"
5.00,"Crest Pro-Health is my husband's favorite toothpaste."
5.00,"When I first put this toothpaste in my mouth I thought \"What the heck!\" It felt gritty and I was a little worried. But when I was done brushing I was very happy with the way my teeth felt. Almost like they had been polished by a dentist. I really like that so I will continue to use this toothpaste."
4.00,"I'm a smoker, regular coffee drinker, and probably a bunch of other things that are bad for me teeth. My teeth have had a nice yellow tint for decades, and no amount of \"whitening\" tooth pastes ever seem to help. I didn't expect much from this \"Crest Pro-Health Whitening Fresh Clean Mint Toothpaste\" and that's just what I got. Decades of abuse can not be undone by a fancy new formula name. That said, this is a nice toothpaste. I like the sort of gritty texture. I like the strong mint flavor. My teeth may not be much whiter after I use this, but boy, they feel clean. For toothpaste power alone, I recommend this. I see a lot of reviews here talking about teeth staining and damaged gums, I've been using this for a week or so now and haven't had any issues other than super minty breath. Maybe it is a luck-of-the-draw kind of thing, but I wouldn't worry too much. Everything worked fine for me."
5.00,"Great toothpaste that I can really tell is cleaning my teeth and gums."
1.00,"It works the same as other toothpaste, not worth the big price tag!"
4.00,"Cannot give a full review because have not used it long enough. Seems to help keep stains at bay."
4.00,"I really liked the Pro Health. It makes your teeth feel super clean and tastes great. I always use the Crest brand. However, I prefer whitening and I wish this product had whitening properties as well as the Pro Health properties."
4.00,"I've always used Crest, and they keep improving all the time. This product is the all time best. My teeth are clean and my gums are healthy. Love that fresh, fresh feeling"
4.00,"I love this toothpaste. It has a great minty flavor and keeps my mouth feeling clean for hours."
3.00,"I really like this in place of my normal mouthwash for my night time brushing routine! I will stick with my other mouthwash for the day!"
5.00,"This product didn't burn your mouth and it left you feeling fresh !!"
5.00,"Really left my mouth feeling super fresh and clean. I enjoyed the taste of it and would definetly recommend it to anyone I know."
5.00,"This product will leave your breath smelling wonderful, it helps remove plaque from your teeth and protects them and your gums from getting gingivitis. I love this product."
4.00,"This is the first time I have ever written a product review. I would never recommend this product or buy it again.The tube leaks and oozes and is virtually impossible to cap once you start using it. The tube and cap combination, coupled with this particular gel, appear to be the worst idea in the history of toothpaste. Why Crest doesn't change this is a mystery. We are going back to Sensodyne products until Crest figures out how to deliver this product in a better package."
5.00,"I thought this product made my teeth feel extremely clean. It kept them feeling clean longer than my usual brand. I was also extremely pleased with the flavor."
5.00,"I really love it, my mouth feels refreshed and awesome and most of all clean!!"
5.00,"Crest Pro-Health Plaque Control toothpaste make my teeth feel dentist clean! It really works great on plaque control. Finally, a toothpaste that helps my plaque stay under control."
5.00,"I am very particular when it comes to toothpaste due to my sensitive teeth. I usually have to use a toothpaste that is designated just for that. Crest ProHealth Clinical Toothpaste was a big difference. Not only did it fight plaque and keep my teeth feeling clean and looking great, but it also didn't hurt my sensitive teeth! It is a wonderful feeling to know that I can find everything I need in one toothpaste without having to pay more just because of my sensitive teeth."
1.00,"It is only 4 oz in 1 tube, it is advertized as 8 Oz. It is complete rip -off for the price."
4.00,"Loved the clean, refreshed feeling that really lasts!"
5.00,"This product does everything it claims to do, plus tastes great, no burning, I will definitely be making the switch on a permanent basis."
5.00,"This is the best tasting toothpaste on the market. And my teeth have been noticibly whiter when I started using it along with a pre-rinse. I bought 10 of these to take overseas with me."
4.00,"My mom asked if I got my teeth whitened but I had just switched to this toothpaste!"
5.00,"The product and price are great and amazon prime saves me a trip to the store. Just two days latter it arrives, like having a personal assistance even for tooth paste!"
5.00,"It's toothpaste. Isn't all basically the same? Maybe. But I have found my mouth feeling fresher for longer with this stuff. Much better than the original 'Pro Health' release. Hoping it is actually that much better for my gums, but not going to let them oversell me too far."
4.00,"good product, helped make teeth feel fresh and clean"
5.00,"What a great product try it you won't be let down."
5.00,"I really like the Crest Pro Health rinse! I really liked how fresh my mouth felt after using it. I will be recommending this rinse to anyone who hasn't tried it."
4.00,"I never really understood palgue until trying this product. My teeth feel so much more clean."
5.00,"I liked the flavor but really, toothpaste is toothpaste, right?"
5.00,"The best in the market! Have tried numerous toothpastes from various companies! Have also given this as gifts to friends who have also noticed positive results in a short time! Highly recommend!"
5.00,"My Crest Pro Clinical Mouthwash works really well at keeping your mouth feel fresh and clean for a long time."
4.00,"Overall I would recommend the product as Crest is a well trusted brand with great products."
5.00,"I like Crest Pro because it does what I need it to do, It has a nice taste, but a bit to sweet. I always wondered with all the scientific information at hand why can't a tasteless mouthwash be made, natural breath is nicer than flavored breath. It should be one with the smell and flavor of water. Thanks"
5.00,"I really liked the way my mouth feels after using this product. It leaves my mouth feeling super clean and refreshed. A great start to any day!"
1.00,"This review is from: Crest Pro-health Complete Fresh Mint Rinse, (500mL) 16.9-Ounce (pack Of 12) (Health and Beauty) Used this product last evening and noticed my tongue felt really, really burnt. I decided to give it another try this morning and again...burning and my sense of taste is gone..... I thought maybe I was the rare one that is allergic to one of the ingredients but after further research, I am by no means a rare one. Hundreds of complaints have been made in regards to burning, loss of taste, and nasty brown discoloration. I would not reccommend this product."
4.00,"Liked the taste & how clean my teeth felt........."
1.00,"The taste of this toothpaste is horrible and leaves an after taste worse than coffee-mouth. No minty-freshness here. Also, the grittiness is very unpleasant. Feels like you are brushing your teeth with sand. Being that it doesn't appear to perform whitening or cleaning any better than any other brand I've tried, I would not recommend this toothpaste to anyone."
5.00,"My family likes the clean mouth feeling that lasts. The price would make this product more of a luxury for us, than a regular purchase item."
3.00,"I didn't realize it would foam in your mouth. The flavor is okay. At least there's no alcohol burn."
4.00,"i could notice a whitening after the first couple uses i will be buying this"
1.00,"I went to my dentist recently and found out I had multiple cavities, so I thought, \"welp, time to start taking better care of my teeth!\" I couldn't see any difference between this product and the Listerine version, but this one was cheaper at Rite-Aid, so I got it. I used it about twice a day for two weeks and one day while I was brushing I noticed horrible stains all over my teeth. At first I thought I had food stuck in them but no, it was just horrible staining like I was a heavy smoker or something. I googled it and found all the wonderful warnings about what this product does. Along the way, I also found out why my sense of taste had been dulling since using this product! This product should be taken off the market."
4.00,"I really like this product. I have gum problems and it really helps. The taste is good also."
4.00,"Made my mouth feel fresh. There was a tingling sensation after using it"
4.00,"I really appreciated being able to try all these products together. Crest is a brand I trust and the way my mouth felt was so clean and stayed fresh for a lot longer than I've experienced with other brands. Loved all the products I tried which included the Crest mouthwash, toothpaste; the Oral B toothbrush and floss. I'm sold."
5.00,"Began using the Crest prohealth. A couple weeks later, it was dentist appointment time. Was amazed how much better it went. Not a lot of plaque at all!! YIPEE!! Thanks Crest for a great product!"
4.00,"My hygenist recently recommended I give Crest Pro-Health products a try, as she said they've been working well for her (the paste along with the mouthwash). So, I picked up a tube of this stuff. I've always liked pastes with a little \"grit\" in them, so it was a nice break from Colgate Total, which I've been using for years. I guess I'll have to use the Crest for six months and see how much pain I have to suffer the next time I'm in \"the chair.\" I've also used the mouthwash, which is also good, in the past. But I'm yet to use the paste along with the wash."
5.00,"Pleased with the results- had a great dental check up and this is the only thing I have been doing differently. Good flavor, long lasting results. Will definitely continue using."
1.00,"Avoid this at all costs.  I only used it a few times and am still experiencing a lack of taste any time I try to eat.  I can't believe that Crest continues to sell this."
4.00,"This is a nice way to try a variety of crest products all at once. Of course the consumer would have to decide if getting all of them is cost effective. But I have been impressed with each of the products and do not notice the staining other people have. I am not saying it isn't real, just that I have not experienced it. Toothpaste is fresh tasting and leaves my mouth feeling good. The mouthwash is not at all stingy to me, it is quite pleasant. I tended to use the industrial kind of mouthwashes though. But it is very mellow to me. I use power toothbrushes. But I do have to say this is the most comfortable non-power toothbrush I have ever used. It is very large and very soft. For an overnight it will be nice to have. The floss is really good. Super comfortable and gets easily in everywhere. One of the best if not best floss I have used. So all the products are good, but it might make sense to just pick up the ones you need individually. But if you haven't been using Crest and want to try them all this is a recommended product."
4.00,"Good product, mouth feels fresh and clean. Feels like I am doing good things for my teeth."
4.00,"The mint taste was very plesant. My mouth felt fresh and clean after brushing."
4.00,"This Crest ProHealth toothpaste at first seems grittier than others but I definietly liked it's cleaning action."
4.00,"Keeps my teeth feeling clean all day. My family also loves using this toothpaste"
4.00,"This rinse really left my mouth feeling fresh all morning long."
4.00,"I liked the toothpaste fine. It worked, tasted fine and left my teeth feeling clean but it is expensive. There are lots of good choices out there for toothpaste and I tend to buy a cheaper option. Thanks for allowing me to try it though."
4.00,"This product left my teeth feeling smooth and squeaky clean. The fresh taste lingered for a long time. My mouth felt fresh long after I finished brushing."
5.00,"This toothpaste is quite effective. It leaves my mouth feeling fresh and my teeth feeling polished, as if just having them professionally cleaned."
5.00,"it's GREAT !!!! I HAVE USED CREST ALL MY LIFE AND I'M GLAD FOR THE NEW PRODUCT"
5.00,"Good, clean feeling after using it. Bonus...It tastes better than some other toothpastes."
5.00,"Glide Floss is the best floss ever.It does not shred or tear like others.It really gets between my teeth to make my mouth feel fresh."
5.00,"Crest pro health mouth rinse goes great with the oral b tooth brush!!!"
4.00,"The mouthwash burn sensation in the Crest Pro-Health mouthwashes is stronger than in some of the other Crest formulas, but is similar to the Scope mouthwash burn. I'm a bit of a wimp when it comes to the mouthwash burn, so the strength of it is usually the first thing I notice when trying out a new mouthwash. My husband who seems immune to the strength of every mouthwash out there, seems fine with this Crest formula and has no problem washing with it. I haven't had any issues with this mouthwash turning my teeth colors or causing any kind of build, and neither has my mouthwash addicted husband. So it seems to work well. It leaves your breath smelling great and lasts quite a while. I like this wintergreen version a bit more than the mint, since I've always been a fan of the more refreshing taste of wintergreen. One thing I do appreciate is that Crest did not use Yellow #5 food coloring to make this mouthwash, since most companies use that color to produce the green hue in their products (including Scope). Some people, myself included, have a sever food allergy to Yellow #5 and can't use or eat anything with that food coloring it it. For those with this condition, note that Crest has used Yellow #6 instead to create the mouthwashes green color. The Crest Pro-Heath mouth wash in the Invigorating Clean version, which is an even greener colored mouthwash, also doesn't use Yellow #5, and used #6. So anyone with this food coloring sensitivity who wants to try these out, can do so knowing these won't have Yellow #5 in them."
4.00,"I really like the way it worked made my teeth feel clean after using it."
4.00,"I like this product, but thought the price was a little high. I'd be more tempted to use a cheaper brand in the future."
4.00,"I was really happy with the rinse. Being a teacher, I really am happy to have great breath :)."
5.00,"I loved this product. It left my mouth and teeth feeling extremely clean and the feeling lasted for hours."
4.00,"I've always trusted Crest products for my family. I do believe you get what you pay for and Crest Pro Products are a good value for the money. I am satisfied with this particular product because it is recommended by my dentist so I know I'm doing something right."
4.00,"I don't really like the feeling of having plaque on my teeth mid-day & Crest Pro Health keeps my teeth feeling clean all day, even after I eat lunch!"
5.00,"This product leaves your mouth so fresh. No burn, just strong clean taste. Very long lasting freshness!"
5.00,"I love the Crest mouthwash! My entire mouth feels clean for hours after I've used it."
1.00,"When I use this toothpaste if it foams outside of my mouth it leaves a red trail on my skin. After brushing I look like a vampire or someone who's been drinking kool-aid for far too long without wiping their mouth off. I've never had a toothpaste mustache before using this product, this is a first. I've scrubbed and scrubbed, but the staining does not seem to go away without time (much like a permanent marker on your skin.)                                                                     Also, when I use this in conjunction with the crest pro health rinse (wintergreen) a nasty white film develops around the inside of my cheeks. It has the appearance and texture of dead skin from my lips if they are severely chapped, but it is much softer and feels like mucus. Don't buy these two products unless you enjoy sticking your fingers in your mouth and removing film."
5.00,"Love, Love, Love this product. I really think Crest Pro-Health Toothpaste is the best product on the market right now to make your teeth feel the cleanest and look the whitest after brushing. And your mouth feels \"fresh\" too!"
5.00,"Crest Pro-Health Clinical is a great product. I use it all the time. I was glad to be able to try the Clinical plaque control. It was a good as I knew it would be. Teeth felt cleaner than ever."
2.00,"I had some temporary pain in my jaw area on one side (irritation of some gland?) and it destroyed my sense of taste for days (not just minutes) after using it. There is research out there on how variable people's sense of taste can be- maybe for some it's not totally disruptive. For me, right now nothing tastes right- very little flavor altogether, but everything is too sweet and weirdly metallic. It gets two stars instead of one because I called the number on the bottle and they are sending me a coupon to replace it for free with another Crest product."
5.00,"My dentist has a rinse that I don't use as it has a horrible taste and long aftertaste. This product is a much better one for me, as I will actually use it."
4.00,"I bought the cinnamon flavor toothpaste. It's an enjoyable flavor and my teeth feel clean after use."
4.00,"It made my mouth feel really clean. The only problem I had with this product is that it left a weird aftertaste."
3.00,"Refreshes breath, leaves teeth feeling clean and smooth. Price is a bit on the high side; I would opt for lesser priced name or store-brands given the choice."
5.00,"I bought this toothpaste and was a little skepticle but it had a great taste and left my mouth clean and fresh. Thanks"
3.00,"Probably very effective, but the texture is grainy and the taste is very strong and not appealing."
5.00,"Not much one can say about toothpaste. Crest Pro-Health has a pleasant taste and seems to leave the teeth clean.                                                                     Amazon was its typical well-priced, easy-ordering, fast-delivering self. Ordered Oct 17th, Free Shipped Oct 18th, Received in Louisiana Oct 20rh."
4.00,"The toothpaste was very good compared to others I have tried. The flavor was good as well and it left me with a nice, clean feeling."
5.00,"I really like the product and how good it works efficiently."
4.00,"Got teeth clean and made breath stay fresh, very good."
4.00,"I like this toothpaste but it's impossible to find in the stores. It seems like Crest must have stopped making it. Don't know why..."
4.00,"Loved this product, fresh & great tasting. I encourage others to try it!"
5.00,"I loved the feel of my teeth after brushing with this toothpaste. Great addition to the pro health line."
5.00,"Tastes great nice creamy feeling, Crest quality and reputation. I have been using this line of Crest product for a couple of yers now. I have my favorite!"
5.00,"This product is truly wonderful! It got my teeth clean, and I could tell a difference in my teeth's whiteness too."
4.00,"I really love this toothpaste! It was long lasting and helped me feel like I had a clean mouth long after other toothpaste. Definitely recommend and will buy again!"
5.00,"Great mouth wash. Helped my swollen gums!! It doesn't sting as much as other mouth wash. Also kept my mouth feeling fresh."
1.00,"Short and sweet: Look at all these reviews. Too many people are losing their sense of taste for this to be a fluke. Why is Crest still selling a product that completely kills your sense of taste? I was so afraid I would never get it back. Steer clear of Crest pro health mouthwash!"
4.00,"I bought the toothpaste and the toothbrush first. One week of using them both together my teeth felt healthier and brighter. The yellowish color had disappeared from the coffee. I then bought the mouth wash this weekend. I have used it twice. My breath not only feels clean but it smells fresh. My whole mouth feels cleans from using these products. I know that even when this tooth paste is gone I will continue to buy it and use it from now on. Thank you for a wonderful product."
4.00,"I really liked the fresh, minty taste of this toothpaste! It keeps my breath fresh for a lot longer post-brushing than my old toothpaste. I wake up in the morning still feeling clean."
5.00,"My teeth felt so clean, my mouth and breath so fresh. Great taste, not to stong. I would love using this product everyday."
5.00,"I loved how my teeth felt clean and smooth. Some toothpaste still leaves my teeth feeling dirty. This was a good taste and a great clean."
3.00,"I didn't like it as well as my current product didn't really dislike it though"
5.00,"This mouthwash is wonderful! I used it for the first time this week, it was great! Your mouth feels like you were just at the dentist. I have never had that feeling before from a mouthwash. Thank you, my mouth feels fantastic!!!"
3.00,"Well! I saw a commercial for this while at my mom's one afternoon and we both laughed about a toothpaste created just for AARP members. When it popped up on the Vine list, I thought twice before requesting it. I'm enjoying the flavor; it's not harsh like some others that I've used. My mouth feels minty fresh after brushing. I can't tell if my enamel is happier yet, though. The texture is silkier than other toothpastes, so maybe it is good for the enamel. After this tube is all empty, I'm not sure I'll buy it myself. I'm wondering if the \"over 50\" claims are just a marketing ploy. I typically buy Crest toothpaste for the family and we've all had good check-ups. If you're curious, try it out. I can't say that I truly recommend it, except on the basis that the flavor isn't harsh and it gives me a minty clean feeling."
5.00,"I really love this toothpaste, I've been through 2 tubes and just opened my third with the only side effects being healthier gums. I only ran into the long list of negative reviews while seeing if it were any cheaper on amazon than the stores (this stuff is expensive at over $4 per tube retail!). I can only say there must be something in it that some people are highly allergic/sensitive to, and that others are not. Luckily i'm on the side of people who've had zero dry mouth, blistering, peeling or any other terrible burn symptoms. I imagine the chemical that makes this great for gingivitis is the same one that burns peoples mouths, so my only advice can be to try it, recognize the possible side effects, and take action accordingly. Granted, the product probably should come with a warning and if it's really this bad maybe should have been a perception release and not so freely available over the counter."
5.00,"Cleans my teeth great and leaves my mouth feeling fresh. I can't tell the difference between this and the other Crest Pro Health toothpastes, but it seems to work great. The only thing I don't like is the cap. I'd prefer a regular style toothpaste cap as this large cap makes it difficult to squeeze out the last of the toothpaste when the tube is almost empty."
5.00,"It has all the ingredients to make teeth and gums healthy. The taste is just refreshing. My kids love it too. I trust Crest ProHealth so much, that I have decided to order several packages of it. Nothing much else to add."
3.00,"I can't honestly say that i noticed any big difference using the rinse so I'm not sure I would use it over any other mouthwash or rinse product. It was adequate."
5.00,"Tastes feat...so much that my kid spend an inordinate amount of time brushing...which makes my dentist and us very happy."
1.00,"At first, I really liked this toothpaste. My wife complained about the grittiness, but I liked it. I thought it was like exfoliating the gunk on my teeth. Well, apparently the exfoliating is not limited to just the teeth. All of the inside of my mouth began to become raw after a couple of weeks of using this. I had just gotten a filling in a couple of my teeth, and thought maybe I was allergic to the filling material. Instead of going straight to the dentist, I decided to look up \"mouth peeling\" on google, and lo-and-behold, there was the Crest toothpaste I had been using. I threw this tube in the trash and am going with something else now. My mouth already feels better after one day of not using this stuff. Stay away from it!"
3.00,"I didn't notice any difference in how clean or fresh my mouth felt compared to other mouthwashes I have used so I see no justification for the higher price. The mouthwash made my mouth foam and want to spit for about a minute after using it."
5.00,"This is a product I will put on my pantry list for now on. My mouth felt very fresh and clean."
1.00,"So I decided that I would try it out thinking that it would help and got it because it says alcohol free but the second that I used it it burned my entire mouth. Plus when I spit it out, blue chuncks came out that im am now suspecting are the inner lining of my cheeks. Instead of having a fresh clean feeling, my mouth burned and my tongue was numb. I haven't experienced any staining of my teeth but I dont want to. This stuff is going down the drain."
5.00,"My mouth feels cleaner after brushing with it. It also is recommended for people with dry mouth. Getting it through Amazon is convenient, and less expensive."
3.00,"But the after taste is so bad I can't use it anymore."
5.00,"Crest did it again! Their Pro-Health line of products is the best! This toothpaste is refreshing, tastes great, but most importantly, does a great job cleaning."
5.00,"Thought all toothpastes were the same. My teeth have never felt sooo clean :)"
3.00,"I was surprised by some of the reviews for Crest Pro-Health Whitening Fresh. Several people are the toothpaste stained their teeth or caused redness and mouth sores. I haven't had any of these issues. My teeth feel clean after brushing with no noticeable stains or pain. I do however get an odd after taste that isn't a clean taste but isn't that bad. The after taste doesn't make me want to brush with this toothpaste. With after taste and negative reviews from others I can't recommend this toothpaste to others."
4.00,"This is a really good product, and I would recommend it."
5.00,"Crest Prohealth leaves my teeth feeling clean, smooth and refreshed!"
5.00,"Buying this toothpaste makes me want to brush my teeth more often! It comes in a two pack so you wont have to share with your significant other."
5.00,"Great tasting, great value. Teeth feel and look great"
4.00,"Brushing your teeth with the Crest Clinical toothpaste is just like have your teeth cleaned at the dentist."
4.00,"I loved this toothpaste. It made my gums feel really good"
5.00,"I love that I can feel the continuous benefits hours after having used this product. I sometimes have a coffee soon after brushing and still my teeth have that clean, smooth, refreshing feel! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!"
4.00,"I was very pleased with this toothpaste. It left my teeth feeling very clean and it has a great flavor. I noticed a big difference in the texture of my teeth just days after using this product.. they felt cleaner and smoother."
4.00,"My teeth feel nice and clean after using this toothpaste. My dentist has commented multiple times that I'm doing a great job brushing and that there's no plaque on my teeth. Thanks!"
2.00,"I really like the toothpaste but the cap is terrible. It leaks all over the top of the vanity no matter how you position it. You can put it on its side or stand it on the cap and it continues to leak. You are left with a greenish blue mess. This also is a waste of money because at least 10-20% of the product comes out and is never used. The company should consider using a conventional cap. As it is, I will not be buying any more of this product as it is currently presented."
4.00,"Its a good product and it works pretty well, its a little more expensive than I would have liked though. A small bottle costs more than a big bottle of other leading brands. It did work though and my mouth did feel pretty clean. Overall on a scale of one to ten ten being awesome and one being awful I give it a 6 only because affordability is not so great."
5.00,"I loved the toothpastes ability to keep my teeth feeling clean all day."
4.00,"This product made my mouth feel super clean. Would definately buy it again!"
3.00,"My mouth felt clean and fresh. I would recommend it."
5.00,"I LOVE these products - my teeth felt so clean that I just knew I was doing good things for my health!"
5.00,"It makes your teeth feels so clean after.. I love it.."
5.00,"I felt this product helped keep my mouth, teeth and gums fresh and protected. Had a regular check up and got good report. Thanks Crest"
5.00,"makes your mouth feel so clean and it tastes good."
1.00,"My dental hygentist recommended I use flouride rinse cause of my sensitive teeth. She said it fills in the porous holes so my teeth won't be so sensitive. I purchased Crest Pro-Health 1L bottle \"anticavity flouride rinse\" from Sam's Club. A few weeks later I realized my teeth were turning browner and browner. I started using whitening strips to remove the brown stains, but within 3 days of whitening my teeth they are back to brown & very dark brown in between the teeth. I got so desperate I googled \"teeth suddently turning brown\" & look what turned up! How could Crest do this???!!!! There should be a Class-Action suit against P&G. At my age, who can read that tiny disclaimer?! They should put a large font WARNING sign on the Front of the bottle \"IN MOST CASES, WILL CAUSE BROWN TEETH\"! Not only are they brown but there is no more slipperyness to my teeth...their entire texture has changed, like the outerlayer of enamel seems to be stripped away as though acid ate through it. I am so appalled w/P&G I will no longer purchase their products. To think I had to use Crest Whitening Strips to get rid of the Crest Pro-Health induced brown stains! What a racket!"
5.00,"I loved how I noticed improvements to how good my teeth looked already. It also make my teeth cleaner, whiter and overall healthier."
5.00,"I have used various toothpastes over the years, but always come back to Crest. I like the way my teeth feel afterwards. I enjoy the flavor. I like how my dental tech compliments me at about every visit for how well my teeth are maintained. Crest and Oral B toothbrushes do the trick! LOVED those nice coupons you sent us too!"
3.00,"I found this to be standard toothpaste. Not long after using the toothpaste, I found my breath did not feel as refreshing as with my usual toothpaste. I use Crest products all the time, but find only particular ones to actually last long enough to keep my breath fresh. However, my gums look and feel healthier."
5.00,"i only use crest. and this was a great experince for me and my daughter. the mouth wash was not (hot) and the flavor was great!"
5.00,"I have tried this mouthwash and does what it says I believe. I like that my mouth feels fresh and that it doesn't burn. That is always a good thing to have a product with a great price as well!"
3.00,"I enjoyed using this product, and as usual crest never disappoints."
3.00,"Hopefully when I return to my dentist's chair I'll find out that this works to reduce or control my plaque. It works fine as far as brushing my teeth goes, tastes fine as far as toothpaste goes (what can you really say other than it freshened my mouth?). I would buy this product again ."
4.00,"Good toothpaste but I didn't see anything significantly better about it."
5.00,"I love this toohtpaste, it tasted great and it left my mouth feeling really clean and my teeth really smooth. Its all my hubby wants me to buy now"
4.00,"It's my first time trying this type from the Crest line. It's not too pasty like typical whitening toothpaste and it doesn't leave too much of an after taste. I would buy this again."
4.00,"If you're looking for cinnamon toothpaste, this is a great one. Tastes good, not too strong/burning like some of the natural brands of cinnamon toothpaste, and my teeth feel clean. No complaints here. I will order again."
3.00,"I didn't think it was much better than the other crest rinses I've used."
4.00,"It smells great, tastes great and i recommended it to everyone! i will run out and buy it again and use it!"
3.00,"I think that Crest mouthwashes tens to have a bitter aftertaste. For first few second I like this one, it taste almost like a spearmint chewing gum, except there's no sweetness. It is a bit bitter and this lingered in my mouth for quite a while. i'll stick to my favorite one Listerine no alcohol."
5.00,"Tried this product and found that it left my teeth feeling cleaner than usual...like they were just cleaned at the dentist!"
1.00,"Right After finishing the whole entire bottle I noticed my bottom and top front teeth with some brownish stains. Sure didn't have them before, they look bad and make feel uncomfortable. This mouth wash also leaves a blue sticky web in your mouth.              After noticing the stains my wife and I did a quick google research finding out this product with lot of others complains about the same out come and situation. I've using biotene mouth wash for a long time with no problem but wanted to try something new. I'm very disappointed and mad about this product, it should be recall from the market."
5.00,"Crest Clinical mouthwash really does the job right!"
4.00,"i like the whole product,i love that is alcohol free.The only thing i dont like is that it left a bitter after taste."
5.00,"Crest has always been my favorite toothpaste. People have always commented on my teeth and how white they are. I use the whitening strips followed up with this toothpaste and keep my teeth looking amazing and healty. Thanks Crest!"
4.00,"The only knock I have is this tube is hard to close. And it leads to having a somewhat messy appearance. As for the toothpaste, it's great."
5.00,"Very nice product. My teeth felt smooth and clean as well as my breath was fresh."
1.00,"I bought this mouthwash on a whim last week because it was on sale, and because it had no alcohol. I used it only twice and developed severe pain in my molars (sensitivity to touch and pressure), a sore throat, swollen sores on my tongue, stains near my gum line, and I lost my sense of taste for 12 hours. I thought I was just being paranoid, so I did a Google search for this product, lo and behold, there are pages upon pages of consumer complaints for this product. After warning my husband about it, he also had the same problems.                                                                     I contacted P&amp;G, only to be told that all of these things are normal. They told me that I should brush my teeth and have my teeth cleaned by a dentist, as if I wasn't already doing that. To add to the insult, they offered me a coupon for their toothpaste. An oral care company should realize that insurance only pays for two cleanings a year, and anything beyond that is out of pocket. I should not have to pay for a special cleaning because of my mouthwash! I have since switched to another brand and, not shockingly, my symptoms have disappeared. I cannot believe that a company can create a product with such dangerous side effects, arrogantly call those side effects normal, and continue to sell the product knowing that consumers will trust it because it is a name brand. I will never buy a Crest product again, and I have told every single person I know about the issues I have experienced. It sounds silly, but never underestimate the power of word of mouth. If you had a bad experience, tell someone!"
1.00,"Avoid using this product at all costs. I was given this as a sampler from my dentist and within a day of using it I was suffering from the skin peeling problem many people here have brought up. Along with the skin peeling the tooth paste destroys your taste buds. After brushing with it my mouth and tongue felt like I had just drank boiling hot coffee. I immediately switched back to my old toothpaste and am back to normal now."
4.00,"It left my teeth white and shiny. I wish it had more of a mouth wash in it."
5.00,"We love this product for helping with keeping our families teeth clean. With all the bottled water and sugar that todays society consumed it is more important than ever to use something extra to help with tartar and plaque build up. We found this product to be refreshing and the kids don't feel it is too \"strong\" of a taste."
5.00,"This is a great product for my 11 year old son who hates to brush. Even if he \"forgets\" to brush (despite my constant reminding) he will always use the rinse."
1.00,"My dental hygentist recommended I use flouride rinse cause of my sensitive teeth. She said it fills in the porous holes so my teeth won't be so sensitive.

5.00,"i love this stuff makes my mouth feel clean and refreshed would not change it for anything"
4.00,"These products did a great job. They made our mouths feel very clean. We will definitely use them again."
5.00,"This product is great and makes your teeth feel so clean and your mouth refreshed. It made my teeth feel like I had just had a professional cleaning form the dentist. I will inform others about this great product, I will have to keep using it from now on."
1.00,"This toothpaste is dangerous. It has caused severe reactions for many people, myself and a previous commenter included. Red, raw lips, gums, and cheeks, ulcers, blisters, skin \"sloughing\" off... maybe you'll be one of the lucky ones who don't experience any of these symptoms, but why take the chance? This isn't a \"one-in-ten-thousand\" reaction. Just go to consumer affairs and search \"crest,\" and you'll see it's far from rare."
5.00,"This is the only toothpaste my husband will use. It leaves teeth feeling dentist-office clean!"
5.00,"This toothpaste is amazing!!!! I cant get enough of it. I look forward to brushing my teeth whenever I can. I use it night & day. Thanks Amazon for making it available!!"
4.00,"I like this toothpaste because it's not gritty like some other ones are. It's also not an overwhelmingly minty one."
5.00,"I was very impressed with the Crest Pro-Health Clinical mouthwash. I've been using it for about a week, and I'm seeing a slight improvement already. Looking forward to the long-term results."
5.00,"Once again, Crest has come up with an outstanding product!!! I would highly recommend using the Pro-Health toothpaste!"
5.00,"I love this toothpaste. Great feeling, good texture in the mouth and leaves you much cleaner than other pastes. Great job!!"
4.00,"Always like Crest. I have used to for years and like this new product."
5.00,"I love this product it does everything it says it will. I leaves your teeth squeeky clean and your mouth feeling fresh."
2.00,"This stuff browned my teeth more than I could stand. If you have very straight teeth, and you clean them very, very well prior to using this mouthwash, you might like it."
1.00,"Into the trash it goes."
4.00,"I loved the cleaning this product delivers. You can feel it foam up and cover your teeth. It really gives me the sense that it is working, which I like. My only dislike would be the flavor. I like minty, and this just didn't deliver to my standards. It was kind of \"blah.\""
4.00,"Loved this mouthwash, left my mouth feeling much cleaner than most rinses, excited to keep using"
5.00,"I love this product. My teeth feel really clean. I shared my experience on Facebook and youtube"
5.00,"I Like the feel of this toothpaste on my teeth and hopefully keep my teeth free of decay. Gum disease is a real concern for me and this seems to make my gums feel healthier."
4.00,"I LIKED THE WAY IT LEFT MY MOUTH. IT LEFT MY TEETH CLEAN."
5.00,"After using this product I noticed that my mouth feels cleaner longer! I don't feel like I need to brush my teeth again 2 hours later!"
4.00,"This had a nice taste but it was difficult to tell if it had a whitening effect."
4.00,"My mouth felt clean after using this and I felt like I had decent results with this within two weeks of using."
5.00,"This product is great, it works great to help keep our mouths fresh."
5.00,"My month feels so clean and refreshed. Not harsh at all"
1.00,"After using for a week or so I noticed brown stains on my teeth. Switched back to ACT and have not had the staining."
1.00,"I accidentally stumbled across a new diet plan: this mouthwash is so horrible that it numbs your tastebuds for literally days and makes it so you don't enjoy eating food. I'm so upset. It's been like 3 days since I stopped using it and my ability to taste is only about at 70%. Update: I found that the lost taste/smell possibly to do with the mouthwash residue gumming up your palate. If you're in this situation, try sucking really hard on a piece of candy toward the back of your mouth, or gargling with some sort of carbonated soda. The bubbles and acid should work some of the residue away. It's bizarre, but it seems to work and I'm now mostly back to normal but I'll never buy this stuff again."
4.00,"This is the same product my dentist uses. I usually purchase a generic product that is less costly. I enjoy the fresh feeling I have for quite some time after using this mouthwash. The taste is pleasant and is not overpowering. My dentist thinks the generic brand works for me yet this is the product he uses in his practice. I expect to have the same benefit with Crest as with my generic product. If my hygienist gives me even better news I will undate this report."
2.00,"Should of listened to the one in the pack of lemmings that warned of this.. I'm bummed as I was hoping to have my toothpaste buying handled..lol Bottom line: This tastes like crap.. End of story.. Onward with my search!"
1.00,"I used this product and at first thought it was really cleaning my mouth. After several weeks my tongue felt like I'd severely burned it. It was extremely sensitive and foods ranging from sweet to salty caused major flare ups. I googled this product and realized it was the cause. The overall reviews are extremely consistent and confirm the defective product and the pain it brings. I hope this review will cause multiple people to not buy the product. I have stopped using the mouthwash for several days now and have barely gotten any relief. I wish I had stopped using it sooner."
4.00,"I have purchased and have been using this toothpaste for a week or two now. I do enjoy the toothpaste, and my mouth feels healthy and clean. I think the dentist will be pleased with the results during my next 6 month cleaning. However, I do enjoy when toothpastes have whitening option to them."
5.00,"Crest has always been my toothpaste of choice. I really like this newish package design; it is nice to be able to stand my toothpaste on the cap so it takes less room on the counter. This flavor is nice, it has a pleasant minty flavor that is not too overpowering. It is more of a gel than a paste, which is something you should keep in mind if you don't like gel toothpaste."
5.00,"I hate toothpaste that works a couple of hours then leaves your mouth and breath questionable the ret of the day. This toothpaste left my mouth feeling clean without bad breath the whole day. Absolutely love it, and now so does my husband."
5.00,"Crest Pro-Health makes my mouth feel very clean after I use it. I enjoy the flavor and have a clean-mouth feeling for hours after brushing!"
5.00,"I have been using this mouthwash for a bit over a year now and it is great. I am not sure what all the complaints are about regarding after taste, it leave my mouth minty fresh. One more comment on some of the other comments. The \"bits of whatever\" you see when you spit out the mouth wash are food particles that get colored purple by this mouth wash. I find that if I eat a pasta dinner, the next morning I see these dark purple tiny chucks in the after rinse. This is NOT a flaw in the product but rather a BENEFIT as you can clearly see that it loosens and washes out particles your toothbrush misses."
5.00,"I really like the toothpaste! It left my teeth feeling clean and my mouth refreshed!"
3.00,"I didn't notice any difference while using the new Pro-health toothpaste than I did using any other toothpaste. It's still a good toothpaste, but I don't think it lives up to the description."
5.00,"Crest toothpaste works great on my son's teeth. His teeth were stained and after using this toothpaste for about 2 months, they looks very clean."
4.00,"This line of oral care works great. My mouth feels clean and the taste it not bad. Some toothpaste taste awful and this is NOT one of them. I buy many brands because sometimes when money is tight, you buy what you can afford; 9x out of 10 this toothpaste is in my bathroom."
4.00,"Overall the product was very good and it provided an after the dental cleaning feel without the visit!"
5.00,"This does keep your breath, if not necessarily fresh ager a night's slumber, at least prevents it from being turning foul. It also tastes great and makes my mouth feel satisfying fresh and clean after brushing. Good stuff!"
4.00,"Loved this mouthwash, left my mouth feeling fresh and clean."
4.00,"I would definitely buy it again and again i love the flavor its really a good product"
5.00,"Using this product makes my teeth feel so clean! I love the fresh minty taste and the healthy feeling I have when I use it."
5.00,"Works well for sensitive areas due to recessed gums."
5.00,"I thought my mouth felt clean and fresh after using this!"
5.00,"This product performs just as promised! Crest Pro Health has always been a favorite brand around here, but now with the added benefit of plaque control, I have definitely changed formulas. Great taste, good foaming action, and a clean that you can FEEL all day long. I feel like I am doing something GOOD and HEALTHY for my body by knowing that plaque issues are being addressed along with the other benefits that Crest Pro Health offers."
4.00,"I have always loved Crest for the quality and affordability. Now that they have added more dental health benefits, they've hit one out of the park. Definitely recommend it!"
5.00,"I love the Crest Pro Health Whitening Mouthwash. It works great and makes my teeth sparkling white. It also makes them feel cleaner. Love it!"
4.00,"Loved the way it made my mouth feel after brushing.. I feel like it kept the clean/fresh breath for over 6 hours, even after eating... Great product.."
4.00,"I like the flavor and it has a bit of a texture which leaves your teeth feeling cleaner. I would buy it again."
5.00,"Love this product. I normally use the gum protection,It really leaves your teeth clean and the mouthwash keeps my mouth feeling fresh and clean for hours.Awesome product!"
5.00,"Have used this for quite awhile but unable to find anywhere, so went to Amazon.com and of course they had several places where it was available! I have a sensitive mouth and do not like harsh mint flavors. This Clean Night Mint is soft and leaves your mouth so fresh and clean - no burning at all!"
3.00,"Made my teeth SOOOO sensative and makes my coffee taste funny for hours"
4.00,"I loved the Crest Pro Health toothpaste and toothbrush. I still prefer Listerine to the crest Pro Health Clinical Rinse though."
1.00,"I recently got braces and was given the usual instruction brush after every meal, floss and rinse.                                              I was shopping around for a mouthwash came across this Crest Pro health I though it was a pretty neat mouthwash since it didn't have the alcohol burn.                                                                     After using it for about a month I wish I had the burn and not the brown stains on my teeth.                                                                     I started noticing brown stains on my teeth but blamed it on the coffee I stopped drinking coffee and the stains persisted. The only thing I've done different is rinse with this mouthwash and after reading all the \"brown stain\" comments on here I can confirm that I am a victim of Crest's brown stains.                                                                     I read the back of the bottle and it does say some surface staining may occur, I assumed they were referring to blue stains (from the dye) but nope it's brown stains. After brushing with an electric toothbrush some of the stains have come off but others haven't.                                                                     It's insane! They even have to nerve to write on the back of the bottle \"Surface staining  is not permanent or harmful , and may be prevented by adequate brushing or removed at your next dental visit\"                                                                     I know my dentist will be able to remove the stains! but he won't do it for free!                                                                     I'm beyond upset.                                                                     I think one of the reason we all brush our teeth, floss and rinse is to have a healthy White smile. It kinda defeats the purpose of brushing, flossing and rising if the outcome will be brown stains. I regret not doing my research on this mouthwash before buying it.                                              First and last time I ever buy anything from Crest.                                                                     Hopefully the stains come off.                                                                     Does anyone have any suggestions on what to do next? Do I write them a letter, email? call?                                              will I refunded what I paid for the mouthwash? Can they cover the cost of my dentist to remove the stains?                                                                     any advice will be greatly appreciated                                                                     please please stay away from Crest Pro health"
5.00,"I loved the toothpaste. It made my clean feel very clean and my mouth fresh. Love all the products."
5.00,"I love the way it makes my teeth feel so clean. After a few hours you can still taste the freshness. Brushing with Crest Pro Health toothpaste leaves teeth feeling like they were just cleaned."
5.00,"I have always used Crest products so I definitely couldn't wait to try the new Clinical line. They're all great but I love the mouthwash. It was great how it foams in your mouth and gets in between teeth! You couldn't definitely tell it was working!"
5.00,"Love the fresh, clean feeling I get from this toothpaste! Feels like I just stepped out of the dentist's chair! The only downside is the normal retail selling price...it's a bit pricey for toothpaste and comes very close to the clean I get from other Crest products."
4.00,"I like the clean, fresh taste and it lasted for several hours after brushing my teeth. It states that it protects your gums from gingivitis which is added plus."
5.00,"I love using the plaque control. In fact, my family now uses it exclusively! It leaves my teeth feeling like I just left the dentist's office. I've used so many different toothpastes in the past but this one toothpaste does it all."
1.00,"I am a Crest user from way WAY back! The ad copy for this particular variety of Crest basically says it covers ALL your bases, from cavity prevention to tooth sensitivity. Only one problem, I seem to be sensitive to the actual toothpaste ITSELF! It has a benign enough taste, but caused some sort of irritating burning rash inside my mouth of some kind. My tongue felt weird, almost numb and then my lips seemed to actually swell up. My housemates started complaining my breath smelled of noxious chemicals. That's when this particular Crest was banished from my bathroom and hit the bin! I would image this doesn't affect everyone in the way it did me, but I am not willing to use a toothpaste that causes me ANY noticeable effects other than clean sparkling teeth. This product is highly suspect and is NOT ready for prime time. While I like regular Crest and use it daily, this stuff seems quite volatile and I would advise against using it. I am surprised it is still being sold after finding many others are reporting the same things. Hmmmmm...... Look elsewhere for a good side-effect free toothpaste. You have been warned!"
4.00,"I am loving this product. My teeth have never felt cleaner. I love it."
5.00,"the tooth paste has a nice minty flavor. it also did a good job on cleaning teeth."
5.00,"I have used this product many times. As someone with sensitive teeth, I appreciate a product that will mitigate the symptoms of tooth sensitivity. This product is billed as something for the \"over-50\" age group. Okay, I'm 49 so that's close enough. Regular use of this product does lessen my sensitivity to hot/cold. It does a good job of cleaning teeth, the mild whitening properties and Crest has always been a high quality product. The taste? Better than most...still yucky in my book as are all toothpastes! This is a product I regularly purchase. I would add that Sensodyne Pronamel is an equivalent product and sometimes my buying decision is made based on which I have a coupon for or which is on sale. Both are good products and I have no problem recommending Crest Pro-health For Life. I give it five stars based on my long-term use of the product."
5.00,"I love this toothpaste! It is very refreshing and your mouth really feels clean....like I had just been to the dentist!"
5.00,"I really liked the clean, just-from-the-dentist feel that I had after using this product."
5.00,"I loved the Crest ProHealth Toothpaste. I had to use it for a few days to make sure it was something I would continue to buy. I have very soft teeth and get cavities so easy and I am hoping in the long run that this will make my teeth stronger and I will get less cavities."
5.00,"We all have bought it for all three bathroom in our home.."
5.00,"I love this tooth paste. Got a sample from my dentist and now it is the only one I buy. It leaves my teeth feeling fresh and clean longer than any other tooth paste."
5.00,"This toothpaste makes your whole mouth feel clean. It has a good level of foam when brushing. The flavor is pleasant and makes your mouth feel fresh."
5.00,"I really love the New pro health crest toothpaste it does a very good job at leaving your teeth clean giving you a fresh mouth no bad odor a big plus for me. My kids always ask for this toothpaste. I love how I can have the confidence of knowing I have a great smile and no bad breath. The only downside is that the tube is small for my liking. I definetly recommend this toothpaste if you want a beautiful healthier smile."
4.00,"Like the way my mouth feels after using it. Cleans great and doesn't burn or sting my mouth. I have my tongue pierced and most mouth washes burn my mouth but this does not."
5.00,"Love this toothpaste! Leaves your mouth feeling fresh and clean. The twin pack is a great value. Easy flip top cap makes it less messy."
5.00,"We really like the toothpaste. It leaves my mouth feeling really clean."
5.00,"Theres a noticable difference when I use this toothpaste over others. Its great."
5.00,"I prefer Crest over all other brands. The Pro care line is my favorite."
5.00,"The new toothpaste left my mouth feeling fresh and minty clean."
5.00,"It makes your mouth taste great and your breath smell fresh. Pleasant and not medicine breath!"
5.00,"Crest Pro health left my teeth feeling superclean throughout the day! I will definitely continue to buy this for my family!"
3.00,"I didn't care for the after taste... But my teeth felt clean."
4.00,"Leaves a fresh and minty taste in your mouth. Will buy again."
5.00,"Doesn't feel gritty on your teeth is minty fresh and feels great leaving me with a refreshing smile."
4.00,"My picky daughter even loves the taste of this toothpaste. It was overall a hit with the family. The only problem I have is those new tops - they don't stay shut and always leak all over the counters."
3.00,"The product cleaned my teeth great bit I didn't like the taste and I thought it was a bit pricey."
5.00,"Crest Pro-Health Rinse is a great partner in the good health of my mouth. Not only is it sugar-free and alcohol-free (two big pluses in my book), it works with floss and toothpaste to keep my mouth free of bacteria and plaque, and for longer than other rinses. The only mouthwash I will buy!"
5.00,"I have used Crest Pro Health toothpaste for a long time and trust it to do a great job of protecting and cleaning my teeth. This clinical formula is excellent, such a clean feeling."
5.00,"I love this product. It made my mouth feel so clean, just like I just stepped out of the dentist office."
4.00,"The Crest Pro-Health Toothpaste tastes good and seems to help with whitening though I think might be better whitening toothpastes out there. I like that it helps with prevention for many things. I might buy this product again."
5.00,"Really liked this product - you could feel it working as you brush. Leaves teeth and mouth feeling clean and fresh but not in an overpowering way."
5.00,"this might quite possibly be the greatest toothpaste ever created, my teeth have never been cleaner outside of a dentist office.i can't stop rubbing my tougne over them, they feel like glazed ice, all this without that over-powering burning sensation. just a mild crisp flavor, again the greatest ever! thank's so much.terrie"
5.00,"I have used Listerine for years. Although Listerine is still effective, I have decided to give an alternative mouthwash a try. Overall, this is a great mouthwash. Pros: 1)It doesn't give you the burning sensation in your mouth. 2)Your teeth will feel clean after use. Cons: 1)I wish they used more environmentally friendly packaging. 2)Way too many varieties. It does get confusing and annoying."
2.00,"this toothpaste felt like it left a film in my mouth. I'll stick to crest with scope :o)"
5.00,"After my family used this crest, they asked if we could skip our nex appointment? It was that good!!"
5.00,"This kept my mouth just as clean and fresh as the dentist. I love it."
4.00,"I've been using this product for about a week, only once a day because my dentist said this product is to only be used for a short amount of time. I have receding gums and have already noticed a cleaner, fresher, and less red gum line. Also, the burning affect makes me feel like it's getting the job done.. I'm pretty sure the \"chunks\" that come out when you spit up is either tainted saliva or plague. About the staining, another reason my dentist said to use it for a short time is because of its tendency to stain the teeth. I would suggest maybe using this and then using whitening strips or something along with it?"
4.00,"I really liked this new toothpaste. It left my teeth feeling very clean and feeling like it really removed the plaque. The taste was great and didn't leave a bad aftertaste."
5.00,"Loved this product, my mouth felt great after brushing."
5.00,"IT MADE MY MOUTH FEEL CLEAN ALL DAY WHEN I WAS ONLY ABLE TO BRUSH ONCE. I TRULEY WILL NOT PURCHASE ANY OTHER TOOTHPASTE BUT CREST PRO HEALTH EVER"
4.00,"I have used Crest for about 30 years. It is so exciting to see them come out with a new toothpaste that tastes great and keeps my teeth clean! Keep up the great work, Crest!"
4.00,"This is an impressive product and would recommend others try it also."
5.00,"I love this toothpaste! It has a great flavor. It seems a little thicker than the toothpaste i normally use and I like that. I have always used Crest products and I will definately buy this again."
4.00,"This product tasted great and more importantly left my mouth feeling fresh, clean, and free of germs. Be gone evil plaque!"
4.00,"This toothpaste left my mouth feeling clean and left my breath fresh, even hours after brushing my teeth. I love the minty fresh taste."
2.00,"Secondly the hoops you have to jump through to even leave a review makes me wonder if crest is trying to discourage people from leaving feedback in the first place."
5.00,"Had some gum problem and didn't pay attention to teeth for a long time. Now it gets back to me. Then I tried this Crest Pro-Health Clinical Gum Protection Soothing Smooth Mint Toothpaste. It helps my gum to grow back and reduce my pain. I will keep using it, at the same time try two toothpaste at the same time just in case."
5.00,"My teeth feel really clean after using this toothpaste! Loved it!"
4.00,"Good product. Although too pricey for my liking, I like the 'prohealth clinical invigorating Clean Mint'. Best to use for morning, daytime. I found that if I brushed my teeth w/this particular toothpaste, I woke up with a weird aftertaste."
5.00,"this is the brand that I will buy for my family - crest is a well known brand that lives up to its reputation. Crest Clinical Pro Health leavs my mouth feeling fresh and clean. I feel like i went the extra step to take care of my mouth."
1.00,"Like other reviewers here, I used Crest Pro Health and had adverse reactions. It burned my mouth--gums, tounge, and all! After an hour or so, my mouth and tounge started peeling thick strips of flesh--it was totally gross and painful. Just to be sure it was the toothpaste, and not related to something else, I tried it in isolation a couple of more times with the same sickening results! I have never had any similar reaction from any other toothpaste. I am not a chemist, but they must be putting in something questionable, or something normally considered safe but at such a high degree of concentration, or just some odd combination of chemicals for it to affect so many people in this fashion. I contacted P&G (makers of the toothpaste) using the email on the toothpaste tube/box and did receive a reply from them--the reply acted as if they never heard of this problem before, but it is all over the Internet about the concerns people are having with Crest Pro Health. Just Google it. Now, with so many complaints, P&G should come out and let the public know if this toothpase is truly harmful and what,if any, might be the risks in using it. I assume P&G is a responsible complany, so come on P&G, tell us what's going on with Crest Pro Health? If it is truly dangerous, of course it should be immediately withdrawn by P&G and they should assist those suffering from use of their product. If it is safe, they should still put out warnings that use of it may burn your mouth, cause peeling of skin, etc. Consumers should know beforehand so we would know before we purchase and not be so alarmed if/when something adverse happens."
5.00,"The toothpaste really makes your mouth feel clean! Love it!"
5.00,"I'm a huge fan of the Pro-Health line of toothpaste. The 50+ version of the toothpaste is great, and I find it gentle for my teeth and gums. Minty but not overwhelming."
5.00,"Crest Pro-Health really does reduce the plaque on your teeth. I have been using this for about a year. I spend a lot less time getting my teeth cleaned at the dentist since I have been using this."
4.00,"This toothpaste makes my mouth feel fresh and clean."
3.00,"The toothpaste did not leave my mouth feeling as clean as I had hoped. It also leaves your mouth a little dry. For the price, I would pick another product."
5.00,"I loved how clean my teeth felt. I admit I feel a bit off if I try something new and it doesn't work as well as my usual product. This worked so well it IS my usual product now"
5.00,"I have used this product for a while and I like it very much!!"
5.00,"Great taste. My teeth and mouth really felt clean after brushing."
4.00,"Not convinced this product is superior to other Crest products"
5.00,"This product is great. Makes your teeth feel clean and does not leave a weird feeling or taster after you are done brushing them. Great taste overall. Very good value!"
5.00,"I really would recommend this to everyone. It left my mouth feeling clean and fresh."
4.00,"my teeth felt clean longer than expected. there wasn't a gritty after taste. i'm looking forward to using this for longer than just a one time use in the future."
5.00,"When it comes to toothpaste I am real picky! I thought this toothpaste was gonna be pasty or even overbearing in taste. It was very refreshing even my 4 yr old enjoyed using it!"
1.00,"I purchased this product a month ago. I had clean white teeth. I always floss, brush and rinse my teeth. Three days ago I noticed brown stains on my teeth. I don't drink coffee or tea and I do not smoke. This mouthwash has caused the stains on my teeth. Please stay way from it!"
5.00,"I have totally switched to the sensitive brand and love this toothpaste!"
5.00,"I liked the texture and how my teeth felt after using the toothpaste. Will buy again"
5.00,"I have used several of the other Crest pro-health toothpaste, and this one is just as good as the others. The long term benefits of course cannot be measured in just a few brushing; but, taste and the clean feeling after brushing are immediately noticeable. True to promo on the box, this toothpaste is smoother when dispensed and feels a little more creamy on the teeth....but it works. Since I'm older than 50, its nice to have a toothpaste formulated for my age group. You really can't go wrong with any of the Crest Pro-health...I've tried three different types..and they're all good...why have I tried three...I wanted to find which one...worked best for me...and after a month of using this one...I'll have a better picture...switch to this one...or stay with my current pro-health selection."
2.00,"So this stuff has the \"better\" form of fluoride (Stannous Fluoride) that also allows that possibility that your teeth might temporarily stain. The taste is a little off from anything that would be considered refreshing...and, the reason it's 2 stars instead of 3 (average) is that the stuff is crunchy. Seriously, who would think that people would clamor to use toothpaste in particles of crunchiness in it? I'm certainly not going to. Besides those factors, for my mouth, my original toothpaste Tom's of Maine Whole Care Fluoride Toothpaste is a better toothpaste for flavor, breath stays fresher longer, mouth feeling clean and refreshed, and it keeps the slimy feeling off my teeth for longer. Wouldn't recommend this stuff...Crest has plenty of other average toothpastes that are better than this, but as of now, I'm sticking with Tom's of Maine."
5.00,"This product made my teeth feel nice and very clean."
5.00,"Leaves your mouth feeling FRESH and clean!!!! Recommend Crest mouthwash"
4.00,"Love the fresh clean feeling of this toothpaste! Great taste and go's deep to clean my teeth!"
5.00,"I love the feeling of my teeth after brushing with this toothpaste... I will definitely buy it."
5.00,"Great product, left my teeth feeling nice. Would definitely continue to buy."
5.00,"I've been an avid Crest user ever since I was little. My parents were Crest loyal and now 15yrs later I still am too. Have not tried a crest product I haven't liked."
4.00,"This product left my mouth feeling very clean for hours. I'd use/buy it again for my family."
1.00,"I am guessing that Crest has transitioned their product line into Pro-Health.  I usually used Crest Clean Mint.  When I couldn't find it on the shelf at Wal-Mart I figured the Pro-Health Clean Mint would be the same.  The first time I used it my gag reflex kicked in...need I say more on that.  I tried it again another day and experienced the same scenario.  So, I can't use it anymore.  I don't what is causing the reaction but I'm not going to use the product again."
5.00,"works great. makes your mouth feel fresh, but like the rest of these crest products, way to expensive"
5.00,"Crest Clinical is a great product. Been using crest for years, and I am always happy to go to the dentist because my teeth stay clean and healthy!"
3.00,"This was an okay mouthwash. I had been eying it for some time. After I purchased it, I noticed that is had some peroxide listed as an ingredient on the label. However, it seems like that is the most prevalent in the bottle. It would have been cheaper to just buy a bottle of peroxide instead of this product."
1.00,"This product will stain your teeth a horrible brown colour! I thought I had some sort of disease, but nope -- just Crest!"
4.00,"I usually use a different brand but I really liked the toothpaste and mouthwash and am thinking about changing to crest pro-health as my regular brand. I already use the floss and really like it, it does not shredd or get stuck between my teeth."
5.00,"After trying the Crest Pro Health toothpaste I noticed a difference in how my teeth and mouth felt - cleaner and fresher! I really liked it!"
3.00,"This toothpaste worked as well as others but is pricey. I didn't really see a major difference relative to other bonus added toothpaste. It help with temperature sensitivity but I didn't notice a major stain prohibition activity."
5.00,"Another great product by a trusted company at an affordable price!"
5.00,"This product was amazing, could really feel the clean. Was not too overpowering, but can already tell a difference in my teeth and gums."
4.00,"expensive, but I liked the product. the flavor was not too harsh"
4.00,"I loved the freshness, taste, and overall feeling this toothpaste after using it! I like the prohealth toothpaste before, but now it's even better."
4.00,"Yes it does a great job of cleaning my teeth. It is a bit expensive and I think something effective is worth a little extra."
5.00,"I loved the product samples that I received. I used the coupon to go and purchase the toothpaste and tried it. I wish there was a better way to test if the placque was held at bay for the hours stated, but my mouth felt clean."
5.00,"I like that this toothpaste from Crest is so multi purpose and yet it didn't leave my teeth feeling sensitvie like some other whitening toothpastes do. Other than that, it has the nice flavor and great clean feeling that you would expect of any other Crest toothpaste."
5.00,"This product works great & a great value. My mouth felt fresh & clean all day!"
5.00,"really works loved it left my mouth feeling clean and i think it brightened my teeth also"
4.00,"The mouthwash made my mouth feel fresh, however it tasted like their whiting strips which is a little gross. I like that there is no alcohol so it doesn't burn like other mouthwashes. It is a bit more expensive than similar products though."
4.00,"Well, I do like that this rinse doesn't burn, easy to swish around and keep your teeth and gums clean and healthy. But, not the best flavor, but, worth it to use daily for all the benefits."
5.00,"This product does what it says it works great and my teeth felt great"
5.00,"I was very pleased with the results of using this toothpaste. After brushing, your mouth was left with a great aftertaste. My teeth felt the same as they do after a dental cleaning. My teeth felt very smooth."
5.00,"I am using the crest toothpaste now and think it does a great job. Would highly recommend it."
2.00,"This toothpaste is for an acquired taste. Everyone in my household dislikes it, but I bought two packs, so we will finish them. I wont buy this product again. The granules that are part of the toothpaste are just too rough. They wont rip your gums or anything, but they do seem a bit rough, so I wonder what it does to a sensitive enamel over time. Taste wise, it is just a miss.....at least to us. It does not taste like anything natural. Some other toothpastes try to add a hint of freshness by adding spearmint, or some other \"natural\" ingredient, but this one is just chemical. After brushing, it does not feel like you brushed. It is hard to describe, and I cant believe I am actually doing this, but it's almost as if you ate some tums. They taste good, but then there is an aftertaste that just does not feel natural. Sorry, I tried my best to be a bit more elaborate."
1.00,"I used this rinse for a few weeks, and after the first week or two, I noticed that my teeth were covered with brown stains. Nothing in my diet, lifestyle, or hygiene had changed, so I waited to see if they'd disappear, but they haven't. I went to the dentist today, and they narrowed it down to this Crest rinse I started using. The problem is well-documented in the dental community and online (just do a search for staining related to the active ingredient, Cetylpyridinium Chloride).The only way to get rid of the stains, especially between teeth, is an ultrasonic cleaning by my dentist (a regular cleaning today wasn't sufficient), which will put me back $125. I'm a bit outraged that the bottle doesn't warn you of the seriousness of the risk, even if it only happens to a minority of users."
5.00,"I like how the toothpaste tastes, and that it does not leave a gritty residue on your teeth."
5.00,"Great taste, clean feeling, will continue to use. A little more expensive than some brands but worth it for the protection it provides."
4.00,"I liked the way it made my teeth feel after using this product, although, I find it a little on the expensive side."
4.00,"I liked the product and felt like my mouth was clean and refreshed. I didn't notice much of a whitening effect but otherwise I would use it again."
5.00,"Does wonders for improving overall health of teeth. I have gingivitis along with my teen daughter and we both had good results within a month of use."
5.00,"This toothpaste made my teeth feel as clean as a visit to the dentist does. It's flavor was not too strong, but left a nice minty after taste. Left my teeth feeling clean for a ling time. Really felt like it got my teeth cleaner than my usualy brand."
1.00,"Well some people talked me into buying this out as it was a new non burning mouthwash they found. Unfortunately for me I started noticing my teeth were getting a brown coloring after only one week of use. I read a fine print on the bottom of the label and it states it MAY cause browning of teeth in some people.Going online to research this product further I find the main chemical used to fight \"evil\" bacteria is actually found in some pesticides. Also it seems this chemical CPC can cause odd taste affects to users which I don't get. Since 2007 when this came out to replace Listerine it has been receiving many issues by certain people. I belong to one group of users whose teeth become tobacco chewing color stained.This gets 1 star from me as it may have no burn in your mouth feel but it MAY cost you some issues.In my view choose another mouthwash with alcohol as its main fighter, those are said to be much better for your mouth compared to what this product contains. Now I have replaced it back to my old mouthwash and hopefully after my next dentist appointment my teeth should be getting a brighter color."
2.00,"Crest Pro-Health Fluoride Toothpaste, Clean Mint, 7.8-Ounce (Pack of 4) Lacks! Let's just say that this particular time you have eaten, drank and smoked various products and your mouth feel like is in dire need of a Car Wash type washing, absolute revitalizing, let's start brand new type of feeling! Then you are better off trying something else other than this dull, uneventful toothpaste! I buy in bulk so it has taken longer to learn to dislike it and by now I give it 2 Stars. Why not 1  Star since  I sound so aggravated and displeased by it?  Because of the Intimidation Factor! That aside, this is one I will not be coming back to, as soon as it departs (fully consumed, cheap bastard that I am!) it will not be on anyone's Wish List. We are moving on to better and more satisfying options, that's for sure! No, I am not a dentist and I pay dearly on a daily basis for not having taken better care of my grill and for that I am truly sorry. But \"Tarde Piaci\" (too late to whine!). So here I am on the market for some above average product, one that can in one brush: clean, prevent, assist with the always present sign of bad breath?, fight and win cavities and gum issues, you get what I am saying? The Daddy O', The Big Papa of Toothpastes! 2 Stars for (great boxing, by the way, reeled me in like an innocent flounder!) Crest Pro Health!"
5.00,"Love this toothpaste! It really cleans my teeth and tastes great!"
5.00,"I was blown away with the results of this toothpaste. It not only has a great taste but it made my teeth white and my mouth feel so refreshed, I loved it and i'm going to tell all my friends."
4.00,"This is not your average whitening toothpaste that you see on the shelf at the supermarket. It is an intense toothpaste that not only cleans your teeth, but vigorously uses chemicals to whiten them. After a couple days' use, I'd find my teeth were a little sensitive to cold and pressure. Also, I felt a few flecks of dead skin hanging out inside my mouth. My thinking is that you should not use this toothpaste every day, maybe just once a week. And definitely try a small spot of toothpaste on the inside of your mouth before committing to the whole thing."
4.00,"I really enjoyed this product. My mouth felt clean and the taste wasn't too harsh I would recommend this product."
5.00,"I loved the toothbrush because I feel like it really got my teeth cleaned."
1.00,"Firstly, I followed the instructions and only rinsed for 1 minute. I used this mouthwash two days in a row and after the first, it felt numb and I couldn't taste anything which I thought was weird but figured it might have just been a one time thing and that my mouth would get used to it. The morning after the second night of using it, my entire tongue was so damaged that it hurt just to move it, if it touched the top of mouth or my teeth, and eating was the WORST. I couldn't eat for days. I only could eat soft foods and even that was painful enough. If I curled my tongue, I would feel immense pain. It was as if there were canker sores all over my tongue but instead if you looked at my tongue there were red spots as if my taste buds were destroyed. Eating was so painful that i lost my appetite for the first three days and then I would move to eating peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, which the un-toasted bread being already soft, the slight texture of the bread scraped against my tongue painfully that I would throw it away instead of eating it. It has been an entire week later and my tongue finally feels healed enough for me to eat actual meals. The tip of my tongue still hurts but at least I can finally eat again! I will never use this mouthwash ever again!"
2.00,"Unfortunately I have to rate this poor. We took it on vacation and I found it too gritty. My husband did not agree with me. I cound not wait ti return home to get ahold of my regular toothpaste."
5.00,"This Crest Pro Health left my teeth feeling very clean and smooth."
1.00,"I thought I had some type of poisoning, was literally sick (bad diarrhea) besides the fact that my mouth was numb, swollen, I was drooling. Not just numb, but severe metallic taste, I could t concentrate on anything g due to the see deity of my mouth condition. Finally I saw online that Crest was known to be bad for your health and I switched toothpastes. There was an immediate difference. I am dumbfounded that Publix carries the product, that the ADA endorses it. Clearly the ADA is not a source for information in regards to health. Crest toothpaste should be removed as a product."
4.00,"I never had any problems with Crest toothpaste. It feel it cleans my mouth wonderfully. At times the toothpaste was a little grainy, but overall it had a good taste and left my mouth feeling clean. I would buy."
5.00,"This toothpaste tastes good in your mouth and it is refreshing feeling. And it helps with the plaque which is great."
5.00,"This is the only toothpaste I have used for a few years now. Usually with enamel shield, if I can find it. It's the only thing that makes my mouth feel clean and fresh, and lasts for a long time. No complaints at the dentist, which is the most important to me!"
5.00,"I really like Crest Pro-Health plaque control toothpaste. It did an excellent job of removing plaque and making my mouth feel as clean as it does after my dental cleaning visits. This is my new toothpaste!"
5.00,"I loved how smooth and clean my teeth felt after using this product!"
5.00,"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this product. Amazingly clean teeth and they feel fresh and clean for hours...even seems to somehow work after eating..but still like to brush after eating. Seriously worth trying!"
5.00,"This is a really good mouthwash. Kept my mouth clean & fresh for a long time."
5.00,"This product leaves your teeth fresh, clean, and whitened. What more could you ask for?!"
1.00,"I began using this tooth paste one night and the next morning noticed that the tip of my tongue felt numb and my ability to taste food with this region was gone. Unfortunately I did not make the connection between my tongue issue and this tooth paste. I kept using this stuff for several more days, I developed another numb spot on my tongue and this spot as well as the tip of my tongue developed a sensitivity to nearly everything. The affected regions would burn severely when exposed to certain foods. Luckily I had a dentist appointment only four days after beginning use of this product. I mentioned this issue to my dentist and he immediately asked, \"Have you switched to Crest Pro-Health toothpaste\". Apparently this is a well known issue. I have discontinued using the paste but it has only been one day. I am in a large amount of pain as we speak. The affected areas went from numb, to burning with certain foods, and now I can't even touch my teeth with my tongue it is so painful. Update: Discontinued the used of this product and my mouth is back to normal. It took almost a week to fully recover. Thanks Crest."
2.00,"Not the best tasting toothpaste, leaves a weird \"bitter\" taste in your mouth. Also leaves a gross gooey film in your mouth after 10 mins. Sensitivity is gone but I get the same results with colgate and actually like the flavor with no goo. Never again crest..."
5.00,"My family likes this toothpaste!! Great product! This toothpaste leaves your mouth feeling very clean. I would recommend this toothpaste."
5.00,"This seemed to be a good deal for things my husband uses, so I got it for him. It was nice to have one of each in the cabinet ready to go when he ran out of his previous stash. He loves the mouthwash and I love that he uses it because he used to use yucky-tasting medicine mouthwash!! This is MUCH MUCH better."
4.00,"I really enjoyed how fresh this product made my mouth feel. I definitely will be buying again!"
3.00,"The Crest mouthwash made my mouth feel clean, but not the best taste and a little pricey."
4.00,"I loved this toothpaste. It left my mouth feeling so clean and fresh. If it wasn't so expensive I would buy it all the time."
5.00,"This product was interesting and I am glad vocal point gave us the opportunity to try it. I would recommend products made by Crest. I like the variety of flavors of their toothpaste, leaves your mouth feeling fresh and minty."
4.00,"Love how it makes my teeth feel.....a bit on the expensive side."
5.00,"Great Product. Left my teeth feeling clean for hours."
5.00,"Not at all a strong flavor which compells me to purchase it. I love it."
5.00,"I have primarily used crest since childhood. and i love this product"
1.00,"What is this some kind of prank!?! Imagine melting the taste buds off your tongue with paint remover, then having the taste of pocket change and rubber bands in your mouth for 2 weeks. Yep, that's basically what you get after using this product. Despite all of the amazing pro-health claims on the bottle, I have decided not wait around to discover if any of the \"clinical\" results are true. I stopped using this mouth wash after 2 days for the same reasons many of the other dissatisfied customers are complaining about. For example: 1. It leaves a thick slimy film in your mouth after using it. This is probably cells from your tongue and gums being stripped off like paint. 2. Your tongue will feel burned for the first day or two, then slightly numb for 1-2 weeks (I'm not completely sure how long because it's been a week and my tongue still feels numb on top). 3. I've had a very unpleasant metallic taste in my mouth for a week now. I expect it to last for up to 2 weeks according to other reviews. It will ruin the taste of almost anything you eat or drink. I haven't been able to enjoy any meals for a week now. It's making me really angry! I wouldn't use Crest Pro-health \"Clinical\" mouth wash again - even if they paid me to! Not cool, Crest! Not cool!"
4.00,"I liked the mouthwash and toothpaste a lot...not to fond of the floss"
4.00,"I got this because what the heck I can always use more toothpaste and mouthwash and the dentist says I should floss. The only problem is my teeth are in such a state that the floss doesn't work that well. And as for the toothpaste it's hard to notice much difference given that most of the teeth I still have are crowns. And I have a fancy electric toothbrush so I don't really need the manual one except as a backup for overnight travel or if there's a blackout and I want to brush my teeth. But the mouthwash is nice. What I don't like about Crest toothpaste is it leaves this gross film in my mouth afterwards. I'd before Colgate but I can't argue with free even if it's not my favorite. That is all."
5.00,"I love this brand! It left my teeth feeling very clean and my whole mouth felt refreshed."
1.00,"I have been having on again/off again mouth problems for the past couple months. I switch up my toothpaste frequently, but always get a crest product. I had been really trying to figure out what was causing all the skin on my inner lip to peel off. In addition I'm having weird sensations on my tongue. Sometimes it feels like burning, sometimes it's a funny taste. I recently purchased this Crest Pro-Health Clinical Gum Protection and started using it 1 or 2 days ago. This morning I took a sip of water and it felt like I had a mouth full of noodles. I look in the mirror and see that my lip skin is peeling again. I started googling and came across all these Amazon reviews with people having the same problem. I think I have finally figured out my problem. I will stop using it immediately. I'm praying that my mouth goes back to normal now."
5.00,"We love this toothpaste...it works great! Makes my teeth feel so clean!"
5.00,"Since using Crest Pro-Health Plaque Control Toothpaste and Rinse, not only do my teeth feel just from the dentist clean, but my dental hygienist has even remarked on my oral hygiene condition and instead of my four times a year cleaning, we have cut down to three times a year and maybe with continued use can get on a bi-annual schedule!"
1.00,"This product is absolutely HORRIFIC! It discoloured my teeth to a dark brown and made me have no taste for up to 2-3 hours after. It also made me gain weight because I couldn't taste food. I poured it down the toilet. DO NOT BUY!"
5.00,"My favorite taste, have been ordering this one for years. I do not like minty pastes, this one is a rare treat. Not overflavoured as other cinnamon brands like cinnamon blast, this one also has a nice texture."
5.00,"I already have been using this product and with regular use it is WONDERFUL."
5.00,"Loved the product. It was a very powerful mouthwash with out the harsh chemical burn I usually experience from other mouthwash."
4.00,"I like Crest already and the Plaque Control toothpaste was great!"
4.00,"I typically do not use mouthwash; I just dont' like the feeling. This mouthwash had a good flavor and it left a clean feeling."
5.00,"tried it...now use nothing else. Price was fair and shipping terms were great. Will remember to look on Amazon when we run low"
5.00,"This toothpaste was not too strong tasting and leaves a nice clean feeling!"
3.00,"I'm not overly particular about the toothpaste I normally buy. Trying this out, it seems to be a little bit gritty, and doesn't seem to create a lot of suds. Also, left me with a slightly \"funny\" after taste. I could take it or leave it, but wouldn't go out of my way to make this my everyday toothpaste."
5.00,"it left my mouth feeling so fresh and my teeth looking so white"
5.00,"LOVE LOVE LOVE this stuff! Not only does it protect but your mouth feels soooo good after your done and it last."
5.00,"This toothpaste makes my teeth feel clean, and so far, it is working to protect my sensitive teeth, too."
1.00,"Burned the tip of my tongue for three days.  Lost taste and had cotton mouth for a week.  This is dangerous stuff!!!!!!"
5.00,"This product does what it says! Have boughten for a friend!"
5.00,"Crest always seems to deliver great products and this is no exception. My teeth and mouth felt great!"
4.00,"I love how my mouth feels after using prohealth toothpaste."
5.00,"I really like this==makes my mouth feel so much cleaner than other toothpastes that I've used!"
3.00,"Very refreshing rinse. But the foaminess is weird!"
5.00,"I already liked the pro-health line of toothpaste. This fits in perfectly with that line and my teeth felt smooth and fresh after using it."
5.00,"Just like the other crest pro-health products the toothpaste is also great. My mouth feels so clean and refreshing after brushing. I highly recommend this product."
4.00,"I like the feel of my teeth after using this product."
1.00,"If you ever decide to make it back into a paste, I will be happy to swich back."
5.00,"Another product that I definitely would recommended to all of my friends and family. I got my teeth and breath really clean and fresh."
4.00,"My teeth felt so much cleaner. I always use crest products, now I have a new favorite."
4.00,"This product definitely left me feeling that it works. You can feel the peroxide bubbling up on your teeth, even after you've spit it out. It's nice to get whitening from a mouthwash and feel it working rather than just the burn of alcohol."
5.00,"Love the mouth rinse - keeps my mouth fresh and my teeth feeling clean long after I brush."
5.00,"Great value, bought as a donation for disaster victims as it's something people don't think about needing. Handy for traveling as well."
4.00,"This leaves a wonderful, fresh taste. It seems to do a great job cleaning the teeth - nice smooth feel."
5.00,"I really liked the mouthwash. I am a heavy coffee drinker and this is the only mouthwash I haved tried that ACTUALLY took the \"coffee taste\" away. My kids also liked it because it didn't burn like alot of mouthwashes do. I would definately recommend this product to those of all ages."
1.00,"I personally did not like Crest Plaque Control at all . I was very dissapointed . It had no flavor at all . It was runny it fell off my toothbrush and it did not foam up very much it was flat . My mouth did not feel fresh afterward . Maybe I got a dudd tube of toothpaste but I'm not willing to spend my money on this particular flavor . I did buy the Crest 3-D whitening because my daughter has been wanting to try it and the flavor was good and my teeth felt great in the morning . I don't mind spending more if the product works . I do love the crest Complete I think thats the best one."
5.00,"I actually got this for my mom, but I decided to try it out myself. I was worried that the mint flavor was going to be too strong, but that's not the case here. You do get a slight hint of mint, but I think it's just right. The paste itself has the feel of a slightly rough texture - like as if there's a little mud in there. But it feels good. When I finished brushing, I couldn't help feeling like my teeth were really clean. I almost didn't want to give this to my mom! Highly recommended."
5.00,"my teeth is very clean !!!! i loved it !!!!!! amazing product."
4.00,"This mouthwash is fantastic. The clean and fresh feeling it leaves on your teeth and gums is the same as when you leave a dentists office after a cleaning. There is no strong or painful feelings or overly sweet flavor."
5.00,"I have now switched to Crest, teeth and mouth felt squeeky clean"
1.00,"I have not been able to pin  point what was causing my lips to peel and to become very sensitive to lipsticks and glosses that I have used for years.  It is definitely this toothpaste, because the problem started when I switched to this toothpaste. My daughter has been using the toothpaste as well and has a cherry red outline of her lips at times.  We have both been using aquaphor to heal our lips.  This paste is going in the garbage immediately!!"
1.00,"Oh my god, I literally can't even describe how awful this stuff is. I have always been lucky and had white, straight, no problem teeth so I have always been really careful about flossing/brushing/rinsing everyday to keep them that way. About two months ago I decided to try out the Crest Pro Health rinse because they make it sound so great for you! I didn't notice anything too horrible at first, my tongue and gums were a little bit sore. After about two weeks I noticed two dark brown spots forming in between my two front teeth on the top and bottom! I whitened and brushed and used the rinse more not understanding why they were there! They kept getting worse, it was like they appeared in a matter of days! It got to the point they were so dark I went to the dentist to see what the deal was. I told her I had been using the pro-health rinse and she immediately told me never to use it! Apparently, there is some ingredient in it that literally stains your teeth! It was awful, not even whitening strips could get rid of them. Luckily, the dentist was able to polish them off but it totally sucked. My tongue burned, the roof of my mouth burned, and I even lost my sense of taste for a while! I stopped using immediately after going to the dentist and haven't had any of the same problems (and that was about a month ago!).                                              I looked online and apparently a lot of people have had similar problems!                                              DO NOT USE THIS!!! IT MAKES BROWN SPOTS ON YOUR TEETH!!"
5.00,"I'm very finicky about my dental health, so I was eager to try Crest Pro Health Clinical mouthwash. I've been using that other brand for years (the kind that burns when you use it!), and I have to say the Crest is a much more pleasant experience than that other stuff! Leaves my mouth feeling clean, but I'll have to wait until my next appointment with my dentist to see if my teeth and gums are still tip top!"
5.00,"only toothpaste i will use. its does whiten teeth, no lie. not too harsh in taste. gives you a light sweet after taste. i recommend this to everyone"
5.00,"This toothpaste leaves my mouth feeling very clean and fresh. Second best to going to the dentist for a cleaning!"
4.00,"I liked the taste and how fresh it made my mouth feel."
1.00,"I initially bought this mouthwash because of the promising label. Buyer beware!  After using this mouthwash 1 time, I could not taste anything I ate!  Whenever I ate or drank something hot or salty I had a horrible burning sensation on my tastebuds- and this lasted over 24 hours!  I can't believe it advertises \"no burning sensation\" when actually the burning sensation after use is 10x worse than those containing alcohol!  I will never buy this product again."
5.00,"I noticed a difference the very first time I used this toothpaste. My teeth were left feeling very clean, like I had just left the dentist. Love it!"
5.00,"I really liked the toothpaste leaves a clean fresh feeling!"
5.00,"I love the flavor! The best mouthwash I have ever used! No brown spots on my teeth.. yuck! I tried to find this in my local pharmacy again.. but the comparable product tastes horrible! Don't really want to pay $20 for a bottle but I now have two bottles of mouthwash that are full and I will not use them.. that was money wasted!"
5.00,"your teeth are left feeling so clean & fresh! It lasts for a really long time also. Other toothpastes make you seem like you didn't even brush after an hour or so later."
4.00,"I liked how clean my mouth felt and I liked that my mouth didn't feel like it was burning after using it. The taste was good, too."
4.00,"My mouth felt clean and fresh and not too strong. I would expect nothing less from my most trusted brand in dental health care."
5.00,"I am and have always been a huge fan of Crest growing up and this product does not disappoint at all. The flavor is excellent and leaves me feeling fresh many hours later. Thanks Crest!!!"
4.00,"This was a great toothpaste, and I really liked the minty taste."
5.00,"This toothpaste is wonderful. It leaves your whole mouth feeling \"just from the dentist\" clean."
5.00,"I love Crest, the mouthwash and toothpaste, are the best, the whole brand of Crest is superb."
5.00,"it worked very well and i was impressed and didn't taste gross"
4.00,"This mouthwash has a mild taste, without the strong bite most mouthwashes have and has a great foaming action that leaves your mouth feeling clean and fresh for hours."
4.00,"I have been using Crest since it first came to market when I was a kid, and I still really like the toothpaste, but the current cap is just terrible. I just finished cleaning out a gob of toothpaste that leaked out of the tube into my bathroom drawer onto all sorts of other objects. Please bring back the old screw top!"
5.00,"This is simply the best toothpaste ever. Clean mouth after sleeping -wonderful! This toothpaste also doesn't irritate my gums like some whitening toothpastes I have tried."
5.00,"I love the toothpaste! Great tasting, cleans deeply and not overpowering, which equals longer brushing--especially for youngsters. Crest is pricier than most oral products, but it is worth it."
5.00,"This is simply the best toothpaste I ever tried. No morning breath-just super clean teeth. I have never really paid that much attention to my toothpaste and I certainly never recommended one - until I tried Night. The only reason I can imagine for this product being discontinued is if you look at the label, Night states that it is for everything, plaque, gingivitis, tartar... but it seems Crest would rather make you buy a different toothpaste for each of these instead of this fantastic all in one product. Shame on Crest. Come on Crest - give your customers what they want."
5.00,"Use daily as we are both over 50, product has great flavor, works well, great value and shipping was quick."
5.00,"This toothpaste leaves your whole mouth feeling a lot cleaner. There are tiny particles that scrub away at plaque, leaving your whole mouth so much cleaner than with ordinary toothpastes."
5.00,"This is a fantastic product that isn't too \"hot.\" It makes my mouth feel clean and yet I don't feel like I my mouth is on fire!"
5.00,"My teeth have never felt so clean! I love Crest and I have been a loyal fan of Crest for year. I must say though Crest took it over the top with this one. Works great, great tasting, clean me feeling fresh and clean all day!!"
5.00,"I will keep buying and buying this item! Love the way it cleans my teeth!"
4.00,"Crest ProHealth Clinical toothpaste really makes your teeth feel clean. It is expensive compared to regular toothpaste, though."
4.00,"My teeth felt very clean after using this toothpaste. The taste was also very appealing."
5.00,"I am always looking for the best mouthwash.. One that isnt to bitter but makes my breath feel very clean.. I think this will do be the one."
5.00,"Or should I say products?! I have tried the whole line of Pro-Health Clinical products from Crest® and Oral-B® and love all of them. My mouth is so fresh and clean feeling. The flavors are not over-powering but you can tell that they work."
5.00,"I love the new clinical Crest! It made my mouth feel very clean and I will never switch to anything other than Crest!"
5.00,"When using toothpaste I like to look at taste as well as how my teeth and breath are going to feel after brushing. Crest Pro-Health outshined other toothpastes that we have tried in our family. The rich creamy paste with the blue sparkling dots give me the added protection that my breath is going smell great long after I've brushed. I also know it will fight off the plaque and cavities that are trying to eat at my teeth after I've enjoyed my favorite sweets and food. Crest Pro-Health has by far exceeded our families expectations."
4.00,"It tastes good and the grit cleans my teeth and makes them feel like I do after the dentist office cleans them. I don't have any trouble rinsing it away. Got some for my mom too as we are both over 50! Will keep using this."
2.00,"it tastes awful! Did a good job cleaning my teeth but I can't say it was better than my normal brand. For my family, though, the taste was the deal-breaker. No one in my house was willing to use it more than once."
1.00,"I am a big user of Crest Pro-Health toothpaste and have been a loyal customer of Crest products for many years. I tried the new Crest Pro-Health Whitening toothpaste and have been very disappointed with the flip-cap. From reading other reviews, I see it has been a problem for others too. Once the flip cap is used, it will no longer close properly. Even with careful cleaning of the cap, it refuses to close. When the cap doesn't close properly, the product (which is very runny) leaks out of the tube and creates a big mess. The cap needs to be totally revamped and the product consistency needs to be thickened so that it doesn't run off the toothbrush before you can get it in your mouth."
4.00,"this was a good toothpaste--not sure how different it really is from what is already out there but I did like it!"
4.00,"I really liked this toothpaste, but it's not my favorite. I feel like it left my mouth feeling very clean but only for a couple of hours. It didn't last as long as most crest toothpastes I've tried in the past but over all it was a pretty good product for the price."
5.00,"Doesn't have a bad taste and easy to use. The product doesn't burn like some."
4.00,"I really enjoyed how this toothpaste foamed up to reach every crevase. The taste was pleasant as well."
5.00,"So easy to get several tubes of the toothpaste and have them on hand, then running to the drugstore for each tube, and with two of us using the same brand, it makes life much easier"
5.00,"I used all my coupons and bought all the crest pro products and they absolutely work in as little as a few days it has reduced my plaque and I also have gum disease and I can see a difference in the coloration and feel of my gums,I love it!"
5.00,"Unlike some mint-flavored toothpastes, this version of Crest doesn't knock you back as soon as you start brushing; it's a very light mint without any bite. It does, however, have a grittiness to it like the polish at the dentist's office. Crest has also started using the new type of stand-up cap that seems to be increasingly used. My cat frequently jumps on the counter to knock over the toothpaste, but at least I can try to keep things neat by standing it up. As for whether or not I'll see any improvement with the health of my teeth, I'll have to report back after my next cleaning."
5.00,"This toothpaste has a great flavor and leaves me with a fresh clean feeling for a long time after using it."
5.00,"I enjoyed using this product and found my mouth and teeth to feel extremely clean and fresh. It also helped my teeth to look whiter."
5.00,"I really like the taste and feel of this product. Sometimes mouthwash can make your mouth feel funny for lack of a better term, but not this one. It left my mouth feeling clean and fresh."
5.00,"My dentist suggested I stay away from alcohol-based mouthwash products because they are too harsh. My child's dentist recommended Crest Pro-Health--I noticed that she uses it as well (although not for the younger kids, obviously).                                                                     I've been using this product for more than a year, maybe 2 years, and have never had any discolorations, loss of sensation, or numbness. After trying to find some documentation on those issues, it's possible that the numbness and loss of sensation (loss of taste) could be due to an allergic reaction.                                                                     I like this because, my teeth are not in excellent shape, and it has really helped me to not have any more cavities or other dental procedures."
4.00,"Ok, I will start by telling you I am 56 years old, so this toothpaste is supposed to be geared towards my age group. To be honest, I cannot testify that it meets 'my age group's needs'. I typically have decent teeth and gums, use an electric toothbrush and try to floss often. So, I don't have 'problems' which supposedly this toothpaste addresses. I will tell you, though, that the flavor is great and that my teeth and gums feel super clean and fresh after using the Pro-health for Life toothpaste. I assume, since it's been through clinical studies, that the claims are proven, so I am rating this with 4 stars. I will say that I will buy this toothpaste again as I do like it better than other standard Crest products."
4.00,"This product was a great choice! My family really liked the way it made our teeth feel nice a clean. But what really impressed me was that my 5 yo daughter actually liked it! ;) I'm sold!"
4.00,"This toothpaste is a great addition to the rest of the Crest Pro-Health line. I like the taste and the mouth feel after I brush. Like with all Pro-Health toothpastes, a film can form in my mouth, but I found that if I just brush a little longer, I don't have to worry about it."
1.00,"this toothpaste, made my gums, and lips, swell up. I have not had this happen to any of the other crest products. will not use again."
5.00,"i went to the dentist a couple of months ago and was told i had a lot of plaque on my teeth. well, he cleaned my teeth and it was no picnic! i started using the toothpaste and the mouth rinse. these are wonderful products and so far so good; the plaque is staying away! plus my mouth feels so fresh! thanks for the recommendation!"
5.00,"I loved this mouthwash. Most often I find them to strong to use and have to dilute them a little with water. This was perfect! I am so excited to have found a new mouthwash and save a step in my dental routine. Thanks."
5.00,"Mint flavored toothpaste makes my husband sick. We have to go on Amazon to find cinnamon Crest Prohealth--thank heavens! Great product and taste. As usual, it comes really fast when I order on Amazon."
5.00,"It worked pretty good. Not much different from other brands."
4.00,"I don't know what is up with all the bad reviews lol but I love the tooth paste. It is hard to find though. I only give it a four star because it is hard to get use to at first. But it does its job and cleans my teeth. Never had any of the other problems these people are talking about. But everyone is different."
5.00,"I really like the product. It's a little expensive compared to similar products by other brands, but well worth it. I can already see the difference on my teeth! Highly recommended"
5.00,"Great toothpaste! fresh breath and left my mouth feeling extra clean!!"
4.00,"It tastes good! it feel good to brush with the crest paste and it seems to be doing a good job!!"
1.00,"I have always had white teeth... until now.  Now I have brown patches in between my teeth after using this product for 2 weeks. DO NOT USE."
4.00,"I enjoyed this product. It made my teeth and mouth feel clean."
5.00,"My teeth feel so clean! I definitely recommend this product!"
1.00,"I couldn't figure out why my lips had started burning and itching. The only thing that came into contact with them that was new or different was the Crest Pro-Health Sensitive + Enamel Shield sample that I had been given by my dentist. I used it for about a week or two and it did seem to help a sensitivity issue I was having , but it left an awful after-taste, and the burning on my lips was painful and irritating. I threw it away and have gone back to using the brand I used to use. I plan on calling my dentist to see what she has to say."
4.00,"I was very pleased with this product. It left my mouth feeling fresh and clean."
5.00,"This was an excellent price and I was able to save even more because I did not have to pay for shipping on this item - I just picked it up at my local WalMart store the same day I ordered it. That's what I call great service."
5.00,"It's not a too strong of a taste, and it reminds me of a fluoride treatment at a dentist, so you feel super clean. I loved it."
5.00,"I liked the flavor and the way it made my mouth feel after I was done brushing my teeth. Would definitely buy it again!"
5.00,"I feel like my teeth stay cleaner longer when using this toothpaste. This toothpaste does help keep plaque from appearing. I love it"
5.00,"mouth washed had a good taste, left my teeth feeling nice and clean"
4.00,"I think it's very strong but,also it's still a good product!"
4.00,"The tooth paste tastes good and makes my teeth fee really clean."
4.00,"Leaves your mouth fresh and clean. I would definitely recommend to others."
5.00,"I love how clean the mouthwash made my mouth feel. It's great and has a good taste!"
5.00,"The clinical crest mouthwash is the best I've ever tasted. My mouth feels so clean so I use it 3x's a day. Much better than the dentist."
1.00,"I've tried this product thinking they had their act together and come to find out I couldn't taste anything for the whole day when I used this mouthwash!  I was worried that there was permanate damage but it returned about halfway though the next day.  Just flooring that this could pass inspections with something that long lasting.  I asked around friends about using it and they agreed with the browning and loss of taste, which frightened them as well.  Never buying Crest again.  Very disappointing company."
4.00,"absolutely love it, it's the best in the crest line.my mouth feels extra clean & refreshed after each use..will be buying it again"
4.00,"I suppose I would recommend this product; it does everything it says it would do (i.e., control plaque, freshen breath), but doesn't every toothpaste claim to do that? As far as helping to keep plaque from coming back, well, I don't know if any toothpaste could completely do that, and the sample I used was not pertinent enough for long term opinion, but overall, I feel that the toothpaste is as good as any other one out there."
5.00,"I give this toothpaste two thumbs up. It helps my teeth to stay strong and healthly. I have no problems with my teeth everytime I go to the dentist every six months. They say that I'm just a handful of patients that has very good teeth. It's because of this toothpaste. The dentist said that this is one of the best toothpaste out there and that I did right on buying it. I would recommend it to anyone."
5.00,"My dentist thinks my teeth are extremely clean, so he praised my diligent efforts. It's all in the toothpaste."
5.00,"My husband and I both use this toothpaste and we will continue to use it. Mouth feels fresh and clean after using it. No problems with the cap like other reviewers say."
5.00,"Crest keeps coming out with fabulous products. The toothpaste is great...pretty soon we won't need a dentist if Crest continually improves. So yes this is a great product. Thanks Crest !!"
4.00,"The Crest ProHealth rinse is a nice product, however it didn't personally meet my needs. The enamel on my teeth is worn, so I prefer a rinse with fluoride. I was disappointed to note that this didn't contain that ingredient. Also, not a huge fan of all the fizz from the peroxide, and rinsing caused some slight tings of sensitivity. This product is well suited to help people prevent gum disease. I just happen to be in the market for a rinse more tailored towards tooth sensitivity."
1.00,"Very disappointed. It doesn't have nice taste or leave mouth feeling clean, and has a very gritty texture. No matter how much mouth is rinsed, there remains some residue inside mouth that tends to cooagulate and then (warning: gross) -- the residue later comes out of mouth onto lips in stringy white gooey form. Yuk! Most important -- it caused EXTREME sensitivity in teeth, which was completely resolved 2 days after I stopped using it. I used it for almost 2 weeks, but in the garbage it goes."
4.00,"It was a little pricey, but it left my teeth feeling clean. The flavor was not overpowering."
4.00,"This product definitely made my mouth feel fresh and clean!"
5.00,"It cleans your teeth very good and also makes you breath smell good :)"
5.00,"I've been using this product for a number of years now and to my surprise, I can't believe Crest has discontinued this product.  I used to have horrendous dragon breath in the morning but flossing and using Crest Night really makes a huge difference."
5.00,"I really liked this mouthwash. I have purchased again. It is a little more pricey."
4.00,"The Crest Clinical Tartar Protection is a pretty good product overall. Gives you a fresh, clean feeling. The tube is relatively small and the price could definitely be better."
5.00,"Toothpaste and tooth powders have been around for a long time. In spite of the length of time they have been around, toothpaste continues to evolve. Crest has been one of the most dynamic in evolutionary toothpaste, experimenting with tartar control, whitening, breath freshening, polishing, etc. While all these \"improvements\" are lovely, the fundamental question is whether this toothpaste cleans your teeth. My answer is yes. Does this toothpaste whiten my teeth? The answer to that question is more difficult. I would like to say yes, but I may be imagining that my teeth are whiter rather than them actually being whiter. So, for me this toothpaste seems to be doing what it is advertised to do, cleaning my teeth and perhaps whitening them as well. What I find curious are the reports that this toothpaste causes staining, which seems strange for a \"whitening\" toothpaste, and reports that this toothpaste causes problems with skin sloughing off inside mouths, because I have, as yet, not experienced either of these problems. Staining of teeth is related to many factors, including smoking and drinking coffee, tea, and cola. Certain chemicals that help fight plaque and tartar can increase staining of teeth, particularly in combination with cigarette smoke, coffee, tea, etc., and this toothpaste may have one or more of those chemicals. Proper brushing of teeth will reduce staining because the staining is strongest on the plaque and tarter that forms on your teeth. However, there may be other factors that cause staining in certain individuals. Your dental hygienist will be able to remove these stains during your twice yearly visits to the dentist. The more serious issue is the reported sloughing of skin after using this toothpaste. I have used many different kinds and varieties of toothpaste, and the only time I ever experienced mouth irritation is with a cinnamon flavored toothpaste. However, I know my problem was with the ingredient that provides the cinnamon flavor, and I avoid that flavoring in all foods. I have never had irritation from any other type of toothpaste. I did a bit of searching on the internet and learned the there are many reasons for skin to slough from the interior or your mouth, including sensitivity to certain chemicals, some of which may be in this toothpaste. Unless you are specifically sensitive to those chemicals, my thought is that there may be another factor at work, possibly in combination with the toothpaste. As with other things you put into your body, if you have an issue with it, stop doing it. Crest has been our primary toothpaste since I was a teenager. It has done a fine job, and I have had no cavities for at least a couple of decades. While the later versions add whiteners, tartar control and other added extras, the underlying toothpaste remains Crest. Will I switch from our standard Crest to this version? That remains to be seen. I guess I will figure that out by the time our current tube nears its end. Enjoy!"
3.00,"The product worked well and left my mouth feeling fresh. But I'd like to note that I got the green variety and when I spat the first time, there were strange greenish congealed globs in the sink. Was this the product reacting with my saliva? It was a bit disconcerting to me to see, and I think I'd prefer natural coloring or no color."
5.00,"I found the Crest Plaque toothpaste to be much better than the one I previously used. My teeth felt smoother and cleaner. Actually look forward to brushing my teeth."
1.00,"Since using this toothpaste my teeth have developed an orange/brown stain that forms around the gums. I have never had a problem prior to using this toothpaste. DO NOT PURCHASE!!!"
4.00,"I love this toothpaste. Feels very fresh and seems to last a long time."
1.00,"Crest is hurting its customers by selling this product. Bought a bottle of this product a week ago and I now have brown spots between my teeth. I look like like I have lots of little cavities between my now gray-tinged teeth. I am furious! Crest should step up and pay for the extra, extra deep dental cleaning I now need, due to the THEIR CRAPPY PRODUCT. Don't buy this; it isn't worth pouring down the drain. If I could give this NEGATIVE STARS, I would."
5.00,"I started using this mouthwash a week and a half ago.. and after reading the reviews on here started worrying about the potential side effects. Not sure.. but so far, I have had nothing but perfect results with this mouthwash. It doesn't burn like the Listerine I used previously (although I just noticed that Listerine has its own version of alcohol free mouthwash; will need to try that out at some point) . Also, my mouth feels incredibly clean after swishing. So clean, in fact, that I can't remember it ever feeling this clean. I don't know how it works exactly, but when you spit, you can see clumps(yeah, it's kind of gross) of dead bacteria (someone in a review video identified these) going down the drain. For now, I highly recommend this mouthwash, especially if you're tired of the regular, alcohol based mouthwash drying out your mouth and contributing to potential dental problems. I will definitely be reporting back if my teeth start to \"turn brown\" or if there are any other adverse effects due to this mouthwash. You can count on that."
1.00,"This crap stained my teeth. Left a brownish blackish stain on my lower front teeth that only the dentist was able to remove. I should've heeded the warning on the package. Stannous Fluoride does stain. And who wants a whitening product that stains your teeth!? Useless."
5.00,"I thought the toothpaste tasted great and was effective."
5.00,"I love this product. I am a fanatic about my teeth...just ask my husband and coworkers! My teeth felt so clean and my whole mouth just \"fresh\"!"
4.00,"I ole this product ! It made me feel fresh and clean , something diferent ."
5.00,"I love the way it keeps my mouth and teeth fresh, it is the greatest product that I have found."
5.00,"Left a very clean, fresh mouth even after several hours. A littly pricy but does what it says."
5.00,"My mouth feels as clean and fresh as when I have been to visit the dentist"
5.00,"It left my mouth fresh and clean feeling!!!! I will certainly purchase it AGAIN!!!!"
5.00,"I was a bit of a skeptic at first, this stuff was expensive! Does it really do what it says it's going to do? Well after several months of use I went to the dentist for a regular check up and for the first time EVER my dentist said everything looked great! Now usually he says that I have a slight gingivitis problem, gum irritation etc. Not this time. Teeth are clean, and gums are healthy! That's what sold me is my gums are in fantastic shape; and I feel it's because of this product! Now FYI if you do teeth whitening and you have sensitive teeth, this will not help with your tooth sensativity. I had to use Sensodyne for a little just to take the edge off so I can whiten my teeth. But other than that I love this stuff!"
4.00,"It kept my mouth feeling fresh and clean, I really liked it."
1.00,"Okay, so I got this from a local drug store and not Amazon, but whoa, I have been unable to taste anything except for a strange medicine-like metallic taste in my mouth for the last 48 hours since having used this stuff. I'm optimistic that my taste will return in time (because I can't accept that this is permanent!), but will be dumping the rest of this stuff down the drain. I can't complain of brown teeth (which happens with certain kinds of fluoride, I understand, and even warns about it on the bottom part of the label) but it's royally screwed up my tongue, which frankly, feels burnt. Please, be careful with this stuff."
3.00,"I loved using each of these products together, but I think that was a little overkill. The mouthwash and toothpaste are a little pricey and i think it would be adequate to just use one at a time. Both products had a strong taste that made my mouth feel super clean for hours. My husband and I both loved all the products but the children ages 7 and 10 said the taste was too strong."
5.00,"Hubby really likes this toothpaste because he has much more sensitive teeth than me. While toothpaste is a personal thing, I am starting to come over to his side - this actually works and works better than other brands we've tried (I know everyone is different, but this is what works for us). Anything to help, even a little bit, is good, and it's great."
4.00,"My mouth felt great after using this product. I highly recommend it."
5.00,"Love, love, love this product. Leaves my entire mouth feeling fresh and clean."
4.00,"I liked the way the mouthwash worked it gave me the freshness i want from a mouthwash. Will be using again for sure."
4.00,"Admit that my teeth felt cleaner longer after using the product."
5.00,"Good flavor and teeth feel clean and fresh. Just went to the dentist this morning and they told me to keep up the good work!"
4.00,"I really like the taste and they way my teeth felt after using it. It was a little pricier than other products though."
1.00,"This is what happens when one buys a product and pays no attention to the ingredients. Researching the ingredients I found two that are considered TOXIC. I was wondering why I would get sick every time I brushed my teeth with this stuff. I'm returning to Costco and never purchase Crest products again."
4.00,"We were pleased with the toothpaste and mouthwash. The mouthwash leaves you feeling clean and white for quite a long time!"
1.00,"I recently bought this mindlessly on my routine of restocking on hygiene products. After I ran out of my other mouthwash I popped this baby open on a day where my mouth felt particularly dirty. I brushed my teeth twice and then used this twice for like 30 seconds each. It BURNED. I thought it was due to my initial thought that my mouth was dirty. The rest of the day my tongue felt worse and worse and worse till I was whimpering at how burned my tongue was and how swollen it was getting. I couldn't taste anything and everything was painful to eat. The next day, moderate pain, more swollen, tongue is shaping to my teeth now and everything is metallic tasting. Today, 3rd day. Everything is still absolutely terrible tasting and I havent used the mouthwash SINCE 3 days ago. I'm so hungry and upset and it took hours and hours of research to discover that it was in fact this mouthwash that has ruined my mouth. I still dont know when my taste will fully return. :[ This product should be taken off shelves. If suing them were an option I would. I'm so upset and frustrated."
4.00,"I didnt notice anything really different but the usual fresh mouth, clean teeth the usual I get from my crest toothpaste. I liked it."
5.00,"This is a really nice product...it really gets your teeth super clean. I am loving it!"
5.00,"I usually used baking soda and peroxide, it great to find a product that also uses these and with a fresh scent and taste"
4.00,"This toothpaste is good for my teeth. I feel cleaner teeth."
5.00,"I have been a Crest user for over 40 years, I always loved them, but this new product is the best, it cleans, protects, removes stains, keeps my gums healthy. I am 66 years old and still have my own teeth and I credit this to crest products"
4.00,"The toothpaste leaves your teeth feeling clean and smooth. Very satisfied with it."
3.00,"This toothpaste contains stannous fluoride, as compared to sodium fluoride widely used in most toothpaste. Just by using a tube of this toothpaste is difficult to determine how effective as this product claims to be. It does have a slighter lighter blue coloring and the aftertaste is different. To me is just another mere toothpaste."
5.00,"I really like this mouthwash. It makes my breath nice and fresh."
5.00,"I don't like foamy toothpaste, as it tends to make me gag. This one isn't too bad when it comes to foam. The taste is good, and I like the stand-up tube it comes in. I also like that I can order it online and save myself a trip to the store."
4.00,"This product works great, like I have been to the dentist every time I use it. Won't buy another brand."
5.00,"This Crest toothpaste worked out just GREAt for my family. we used it and everyone liked the taste and feel of their teeth when they finished brushing. Thats a PLUS in my house!!"
1.00,"Worst mouth wash ever! What ever happened to \"first do no harm\" You may have nice clean teeth but you won't be able to enjoy life, ha.! Floride is dangerous! Read up on it"
4.00,"I like the clean feeling after brushing. I do not like the consistency of the paste. It is very thin and liquidy. If I leave the top open, the paste actually runs out of the tube. It needs to be thicker."
5.00,"I am not one to stick with a rinsing routine, but I love the way this one makes my teeth feel, smooth and ultra clean! It also felt like it took longer for the \"dirty teeth\" feeling to come back, even after eating!"
2.00,"the product Crest (pro-health whitening)is sloppy the cap dosent close the toothpaste itself is runny and leaks all over my counter. I bought the double pack knowing that Ive used crest for 50 years and wish I hadnt."
1.00,"I did not buy this on Amazon. I purchased this item at Target and planned to use it after the oral irrigator I DID purchase on Amazon. So, I've noticed these brown stains between my teeth. I thought, what's up with that? The more I clean my teeth, the more brown stains I get. It looks awful! I googled stains between teeth and what do you know..the first thing that came up was about Pro-health mouthwashes causing brown stains on teeth. I sure hope they'll come off. I have not been to the dentist yet, but I sure am going to stop using this product. I did like it when I first used it because it made my mouth feel so clean. I will update if the stains come off or not. I am SO MAD. I do not believe for one second it's only 3%. Oh, and I did look at the bottle and it does mention the possibility of staining. I never would have thought..."
5.00,"Crest does it once again. My teeth really felt clean and my mouth fresh after using this product."
3.00,"I think it works as good as other crest toothpastes."
5.00,"i thought it was great had a great taste and didn't leave a bad taste in the mouth cleaned the teeth very good and it kept the breathe fresh all day"
3.00,"Toothpaste made my teeth feel clean and breath fresh."
4.00,"Keeps my mouth feeling clean and my breath fresh. I like it but its a little pricey."
4.00,"Makes your mouth feel very fresh even hours after using."
4.00,"Crest is a solid brand: I recently visited my dentist, and he said the best thing you can do for your teeth as you go thru life, is give it contact with flouride every single day (in other words, brush your teeth every day with flouride toothpaste). Crest Pro-health for life 'smooth mint' toothpaste, for the 50+ somethings, is a solid product from Crest: it, of course, contains flouride and is a good smooth mint flavor, and this toothpaste is engineered to be for people with sensitive teeth, which is excellent: I would definitely recommend this toothpaste!"
4.00,"i enjoyed ths product it made my mouth fresh and my teeth felt really clean"
5.00,"I really liked the Crest mouthwash. It has peroxide in it so the first time I used it was a bubbley surprise. It has a pleasant taste and easy to use!"
1.00,"I have the same issue that others have reported - it caused my lower front teeth to turn brown. I'm amazed this product is still being marketed. One to avoid!"
5.00,"what would you do to have the clean mouth that is reminiscent of yesteryear. brush with Crest and you will find out because they have been perfecting the types of toothpaste and have found a winner in Pro-health."
4.00,"This rince is great for an overall clean mouth feeling."
4.00,"I only used the sample of the whitining gels but noticed a difference!"
2.00,"I've used Crest toothpaste for as long as I can remember. Sure, I've tried other brands occasionally, but always returned to Crest as soon as the competing brand's tube was finished. I have found Crest toothpaste to be both effective and pleasant-tasting. When I saw the Crest Pro-Health Clean Mint Toothpaste, it seemed a no-brainer to upgrade to this newest Crest formula. Promoted by Crest as providing six different benefits: cavities, gingivitis, plaque, whitening, sensitivity, and bad breath, I couldn't imagine where this toothpaste would go wrong, given my past experience with the brand. Where this toothpaste goes wrong is in the flavor. While I can force myself to brush with it, the taste is decidedly unpleasant to me. I can't quite describe what is wrong other than to say it is somewhat reminiscent of the flavors one experiences during a trip to the dentist. Perhaps the \"Therapeutic Stannous Fluoride\" in it is just too strong for me or maybe it is the \"Sodium Hexametaphospahte\" I find unpalatable. I really don't know and I don't care. I do know I won't be using this toothpaste anymore. If you can get past the flavor, this toothpaste really does clean well, but that flavor is such a huge turn-off for me that I won't be able to use it long enough to determine the long-term effectiveness of this formula. I will go back to Crest Complete Whitening Plus Scope Toothpaste - Minty Fresh Triple Pack 18.6 Oz, which is pleasant enough that I look forward to brushing my teeth. Perhaps the Pro-Health formula might taste OK to others, but it doesn't suit me at all. I should note that I did not experience any issues with lip peeling or sores, etc. but only used it a couple of days because of the bad taste."
5.00,"I decided to try the mouthwash and I was pleasantly surprised! It had a nice taste and was not overwhelming. I could also tell immediately that it went to work on my gum problems. It fizzed up in areas that have been bothering me. My mouth already feels better!"
1.00,"I will no longer buy Crest toothpaste because of this flip top which is a terrible design!"
4.00,"I liked it it made my mouth feel fresh and clean and it still felt clean the next morning!!!!!"
5.00,"In comparison to the many other toothpastes I've tried this one wins hands down! When I brush at night with Crest Pro Health I wake up in the morning with much fresher breath."
5.00,"This is a wonderful product. It left my mouth feeling squeaky clean for hours. All my family liked it as well I used the the deep clean mint rinse and the clean mint tooth paste. The toothpaste was great for my sensitive teeth while at the same time it whitens them. Thank You Vocal Point."
1.00,"To me, toothpaste is toothpaste, but my dentist recommended this one. I have tried it several times and every tube I've purchased leaks all over the place. Until they fix this I am not buying it anymore. I'm tired of cleaning the sink and wasting my money by having the toothpaste leak out of the tube - down the drain (literally!)"
4.00,"I liked this product, but it was very average. I like my mouthwash to have alcohol in it or else I don't feel like it's working, but hey, it works, right?"
4.00,"This is a great all around toothpaste. The minty flavor is okay. It is good for those with sensitive teeth, and it also has whitening properties. I have not had the problems that some of the other reviewers have complained about. This toothpaste worked well for me and gave me no side effects."
5.00,"Loved the toothpaste - left my teeth feeling clean and my mouth feeling so fresh!!!"
1.00,"this toothpaste is total crap pardon my language but its totally true!! i have used this toothpaste for 3 weeks now and from what i can tell it does nothing but damage your gums further!                                                                     oh yes as i was using it one more i woke up and there was this disgusting white film in my mouth i assume its dying cheek skin due to irritation                                              but irritation from what? i dont use Listerine mouthwash oh no i use a moisturizing mouthwash so that cant be it                                                                     oh but wait its because of this damn thing now isnt it? YUP!!.. it does not fight plaque above the gum line it doesnt even do anything                                                                     my gums have changed from pink to light red thanks to this damn snake oil, crest i hope you burn in hell"
1.00,"No drama here, this toothpaste does literally peel off a thin layer on all gum surfaces, and it peels off in a slime.  I spend a half hour in the morning, after brushing, getting the slime out of my mouth or it gums up into yucky little blobs.  Two months ago I had 4 impacted wisdom teeth removed and at the same time I happened to buy Crest Pro Health.  I had been attributing my problems to my surgery, but eventually I realized that my surgery was completely healed and through a process of elimination, it was the Crest Pro Health.  My husband is always complaining that my breath smells like chemicals and he was concerned that my surgeon had left something \"medical\" in my gums! But that is not the case.                                                                     I have always liked Crest products, but it seems that this one in particular has some problems.  I don't even want to know what kind of ingredient/chemical is causing the skin to peel off.  It seems iffy enough, to probably avoid this product, until it has been around for a few more years and more problems are noticed.                                                                     I have not noticed any staining, but I also do not have any plaque on my teeth at this time.                                                                     And my mouth and breath never tastes fresh and clean with this toothpaste.  I feel self concious about it even right after brushing, as if I hadn't brushed at all!"
4.00,"I like a product like this that has more than one benefit. Breath is freshened and it helps boost the benefits of good oral hygiene."
3.00,"I tried this toothpaste because it was in the goody bag I got from my dentist. I've never had any hygiene problems in the mouth so I guess I shouldn't have been using it. But after the first day using this toothpaste, and 2 times after that - I had a layer of white skin type substance peeling off of the inside of my mouth - from my cheeks to the bottom front. What's up with that? I guess when they say clinical - they mean it. Not for me....but it really made me feel like my teeth were clean!"
5.00,"This left my mouth feeling Amazing!! Would definately recommend."
2.00,"Okay, I started using the Crest Pro Health Gum Protection toothpaste near November/December of 2011. I had developed gingivitis and I don't go to a dentist office because I have agoraphobia. It seemed to help really well. Well eventually I ran out and wasn't able to buy anymore, then a couple months ago I realized my gums were getting bad again and I am terribly worried about losing my teeth, especially the front ones. So I made sure to buy this toothpaste again. My gums are still red and my teeth feel funny. But I think it may be helping my gums somewhat. BUT (and here's a big but), I've found that since I started using this toothpast, my throat bleeds. More say in the mornings. I didn't notice the connnection before until I recently bought this toothpaste and started using it again. Now, after using for quite some time, I'm starting to taste blood from my throat. When I burp, I get the taste of blood. And sometimes when I spit there's blood. And when I brush my teeth, there is sometimes blood. And I can tell the difference when its from my gum and my throat. When I did start using this back last year, I noticed red bumps in the back of my throat. But I did just get over a sore throat and thought that's what it was, however I didn't get them until this toothpaste and I still have them. This is over 9 months.                                                                     I might of recommend'd this product for someone with gingivitis, but now after realizing the connections, I don't think I will.                                                                     Oh, plus, my tongue starts to get the feeling of it going numb quite a lot lately. And it didn't start till I started using this toothpaste again. Now, I am left deciding to either choose my health or oral hygeine. I'm a 19 year old girl, so I definately want to be beautiful or atleast have good, healthy teeth. Especially with a big event coming up in the next couple of months. And what guy would talk to me if I don't have a front tooth? Will people find me presentable? In this day of age everything (sadly) is based on looks and appearances. And now I have to choose between risking the lose of my teeth over my health. This sucks!"
4.00,"My 4 year old daughter loves this stuff. She's a big Jake and Neverland Pirate's fan and is excited to brush her teeth with \"Jake toothpaste\". I have tasted it and isn't bad, although in my opinion most kids toothpastes sort of taste the same."
5.00,"First time using this product. it was really great ,my mouth and teeth felt clean, I breathe in and could fell a warm feelingI knew it was working GREAT JOB"
4.00,"Left my mouth feeling clean without the burn that some other mouthwashes give."
5.00,"Leaves your mouth clean and fresh for an all day long clean feeling."
1.00,"I started using the Crest Pro-Health toothpast a couple weeks ago and have too began experiencing the gross, slimy film substance in my mouth. I suspected the Crest toothpaste, did an internet search and see I am not alone. I hope I haven't done any permanent damage to my mouth by using this product. I have tossed it in the trash and will never use that product again."
5.00,"My mouth doesn't feel completely clean unless I use this mouthwash. No strong alcohol taste like many other reviews state."
5.00,"yes cleans and freshing your breath makes your mouth happy"
5.00,"Ths product did exactly what I expected and more! I noticed a difference in the whiteness of my teeth within a week."
5.00,"I would definately recommend this product to everyone! Made my mouth feel clean. This is a great product to use and I will continue to use it."
5.00,"Don't typically use mouthwash...too strong, tastes awful, etc. This left my mouth feeling fresh and clean without an off-putting experience taste-wise. WIll definitely buy!"
5.00,"My hubby loves this toothpaste. Keeps the teeth clean and healthy."
3.00,"This is a very good brand and been around forever. I wasn't impressed and couldn't really tell a diff. Sometimes, I think companies just re-package old products and try and sell you something you've already been using anyway, just to keep the \"brand\" current and on \"trend.\""
3.00,"i did notice that my plaque overnight was not as bad the next morning"
1.00,"My mouth actually felt DIRTIER AFTER brushing than before. Its like brushing your teeth with a grainy fake sugary substance. This is the nastiest toothpaste I've ever used. It CAUSED PAIN in my mouth, teeth and gums. I'll stick with my colgate total clean mint, thanks but no thanks crest. Gross."
1.00,"Like other reviewers have said, this product can turn your teeth brown. Unfortunately, I did not notice the stains on my teeth until I almost used up the whole bottle (had a busy work schedule....). Then I discovered all those negative reviews and the small fine print on the bottle... I can understand the business motivation for Crest to keep this product on the market (apparently this mouthwash works for some people) but its failure to highlight its product's potential problem is inexcusable. Won't buy anything from this company ever again."
1.00,"Dentist found stains in between my teeth and along gum line last two visits over last eight months. All from this crest product. Google it and read for yourself. This product should be removed from the market! ZERO RATING. HARMFUL. STAINS VERY DIFFICULT TO REMOVE !"
5.00,"Easy and save money but reward card!"
4.00,"I thought the toothpaste did a good job of cleaning my teeth and making my mouth feel fresh but I am not sure it make enough of a difference for me to justify the increased cost."
5.00,"I love it. My teeth were better than clean, and, my breath was fresh!"
5.00,"I'm beginning to suspect there might be a lot of dentists writing some of the reviews here :) I've used this stuff for about 2 years now. In those 2 years, I havent had a single new cavity.  I use this right after brushing and after gargling for a couple minutes, I can visibly see the dead plaque/bacteria daisy chained in clumps when I spit it out.  No loss in taste at all."
1.00,"I concur with the other negative reviews and I only wish I had read them before I bought the toothpaste. Yes it does leave your teeth cleaner and whiter, but at what risk? You have a gross sticky film in your mouth that needs to be cleaned off or it can be embarassing. I also experience increased sensitivity in my teeth and gums. My tongue hurts and the area beneath my gums is very painful now. My mouth is a mess after 1 week of using this toothpaste. Another things it that this is the runniest, messiest toothpaste I've ever seen. The toothpaste keeps running out long after you stop squeezing. It gets stuck on the cap making it hard for the cap to close. It's just a mess. Research this product on google before you buy it. Don't waste your money."
5.00,"this stuff is great my mouth felt so fresh and clean all day!"
5.00,"I love Crest and it's the only brand that I use. I recommend it to everyone!"
4.00,"I really enjoyed using the Prohealth Clinical mouthwash. It left my mouth feeling so clean and fresh and lasted for hours! I think I found my new favorite mouthwash!"
5.00,"I knew Crest was a trustworthy brand so I wanted to try this. The toothpaste is better than most in that it has a fresh taste and lasts. This paste consistency is light but powerful and you have a fresh breath much longer than other brands."
4.00,"This mouthwash left my mouth feeling very clean and protected. I didn't love the taste, a little too medicine-y tasting for me, but i loved the feel of my mouth after using it so I would recommend it!"
5.00,"works great without the really harsh burning and taste I've found in other rinses"
4.00,"Succinctly, this is an effective toothpaste. Perhaps too effective since when I leave it in my mouth too long I tend to get things that feel like dead skin that may have been scoured off my cheeks or tongue. That is my one complaint with this otherwise wonderful toothpaste. It doesn't have all natural ingredients, but if that isn't a concern then this is one of the best toothpastes you can get, especially when used in conjunction with Crest Pro-Health Multiprotection Rinse. The combination of these two products provides a wonderful clean for your teeth and mouth. Highly recommended, but use sparingly. ~ Kort"
5.00,"The product does as promised. Gotta love it! My mouth has never been happier."
5.00,"loved it...made my mouth feel clean and refreshed..."
5.00,"Although it states on the product that it defends against dental conditions in 50+ folks, it's a good product for anyone with sensitive gums or teeth. Lists conditions it defends against as - cavities, gingivitis, plaque, sensitivity, tartar, whitening & freshening breath. The paste is pale green, smooth, not gritty at all and has a pleasant, subtle clean taste. There is no sharp, catch your breath kind of mint overload, as with most \"super cleaning\" toothpastes. No after-taste, teeth feel clean and smooth with clean smelling breath. Can state that when drinking chilled water there is no sensitivity but will have to use longer to see any other benefits. It does say not to use longer than 4 weeks for sensitivity issues without consulting your dentist."
5.00,"Love the feeling after using. It felt as if i just had my teeth cleaned by my dentist. Really liked the clean fresh taste."
4.00,"I enjoyed trying the toothpaste as well as the rinse - they helped me maintain a nice, clean feel throughout the day. My plaque problem seemed to lessen a bit and that is something I really liked."
4.00,"I am very picky when it comes to toothpaste, but after using this my teeth felt great!"
4.00,"I have always been a big fan of crest products and this one worked great. Left my teeth feeling smooth and clean. Will continue to use!"
5.00,"Love this toothpaste, it's a paste not a gel. And it's got some grit to it. Combined with the Crest Clinical mouth wash. It's the best"
4.00,"I have nothing to rag about this product. It tastes good but not as good as Listerine Mint. Crest Pro-Health Multiprotection Clean Mint Rinse is best described is a watered down version of Listerine Mint. It tastes flat, unlike Listerine Mint. Sorry. I was hoping it would be as good, but it isn't. Crest does make a toothpaste that has Scope Mint gel mixed with it that I like a lot. Moreover that product feels like you have both cleaned your teeth well and used mouthwash after you have brushed."
5.00,"Left my teeth and mouth feeling clean and refreshed. Teeth felt polished, and the taste wasn't so bad."
4.00,"I was happy to review this product. It had a great taste and I felt that it was really contributing to my oral health. My teeth felt squeaky clean and healthy after use! Thank you Crest Clinical!"
1.00,"For weeks, I could not figure out why everything tasted \"off\" and why my tongue constantly felt similar to being-- turns out, this mouthwash was the culprit. I had an ongoing metallic/bitter taste in my mouth. Great for losing weight-- nothing tasted good and I had no desire to even drink my coffee every morning! I was looking for an alcohol free mouthwash and this fit the bill, unfortunately, the awful side effects forced me to dump it down the drain. Took two weeks for me to regain full taste and a healthy mouth back after I stopped using it. Don't recommend."
3.00,"This is an effective mouth rinse. I am completely happy with its performance; however, its cool wintergreen flavor is gross.I was wondering, while rinsing, if toilet bowl cleaner would have a similar taste - not that I was going to try and find out. My only other wintergreen reference comes from a hard roll candy of which I am quite fond, and based on that reference, Crest's version of wintergreen is nothing near similar. Even without the roll candy reference, I would find the flavor of this Crest rinse displeasing.I do have a clean mouth after rinsing with Crest Pro-Health Cool Wintergreen, so aside from the flavor I can give it positive feedback in that regard.It all comes down to the flavor. Crest is probably okay on the \"winter,\" but they sure could work on that \"green.\" It is a four-star rinse with a two-star flavor - I shall average the two together for the product's overall score."
5.00,"This toothpaste is awesome! After one week I could most def see a difference in the amt of plaque & my mouth just felt a whole lot better. Great minty taste, too. A good brand that I've always trusted but now with some extra percs that I really need."
4.00,"I thought this mouthwash was really effective in helping me maintain a clean mouth."
5.00,"Works good -- leaves mouth fresh for longer than the other toothpastes :)"
5.00,"I love this toothpaste! I had a dental cleaning about a month ago and by using this toothpaste twice daily my teeth still feel as clean as they did when I walked out of the dentist's office."
4.00,"not sure it does anything extra over normal toothpaste, but my mouth felt clean."
5.00,"Love crest mouthwash because it works. There is no alcohol base so the after effects are longer lasting. This is one of my favorite flavors Mint. Use it love it."
5.00,"This is a great toothpaste that gives you a clean mouth feel for hours but it can burn a little if you're sensitive."
5.00,"It's a good product to clean your teeth, gums & tongue. Works well to make mouth feel clean & fresh. No complaints from kids trying it out either. A product expected from Crest."
5.00,"ive used other crest pro health items and been less than enthralled with the products. This was a surprise. i liked the taste, mouth felt clean afterwards.. i guess results are gonna have to wait to see if the product lives up to its promises in its description"
5.00,"I've always been a big fan of Crest but now that I have tried this version I love it even more. You can feel the toothpaste working and it leaves you with a clean fresh mouth, everything. I will be buying this again and recommending it to friends!"
5.00,"UPDATE: APRIL 10, 2012 One last time: There is absolutely nothing wrong with the product, if it there was the FDA and Proctor and Gamble would take the product off the shelves. The fact is that a small minority of people because of their body chemistry and condition of their teeth experience minor side effects such as staining of the teeth and a temporary loss of taste. I like millions of others who use this product, do not experience these side effects. End of story. UPDATE OCTOBER 19, 2012 Went to dentist last week for cleaning after about 3 years. I been using this Crest Pro-Health for about the same amount of time. Honestly, she said there really isn't much to clean. She told me my tartar build up was minimal and ask me how I brush my teeth. I told her I try to brush twice a day, in the morning and at night. Sometimes I skip the nightime brushing and just use the Crest Pro-health. Saying that, I use this product twice a day, morning and night, every night. She was convinced it had to be the Crest Pro-Health. This is the best product for tartar control on the market. No staining, not taste difference after using. Every person is different and some people do experience these side affects from the active ingredient, but the majority of users suffer no side effects at all or else the FDA would of taken this product off the market a long time ago. This is a great mouthwash and recommended it to everyone who does not experience any ill effects from the product."
5.00,"I have lots of problems with dry mouth, the fact that this product does not contain alcohol helps me maintain a little more moisture."
1.00,"After a visit to the dentist, I learned that I had a few cavities. Therefore, I decided to take better care of my teeth. I began flossing more often and also picked up this mouthwash because it just looked good to me.                           The first time I used it, I noticed that it burned quite a bit, but having not used mouthwash very often in the past- I figured that this was normal and that I needed to get used to it.                           The second time I used it was today, this morning at about 9AM. Well, I went about my day at work and ate lunch at 2PM.                           I could not taste anything. My food was bland, my soda was like drinking water.                           At first I thought that the restaurant was to blame. But after trying different foods and different sodas, I figured that this wasn't the case.                           After searching online for a cause, I was informed that this mouthwash can cause loss of taste. Greeeaaaaat.                           I now have to wait for my taste buds to renew themselves, which will take upwards to a week or two- even though I only used the damn mouthwash twice.                           Never again will I use a Crest product."
4.00,"I really liked the way this rinse felt effervescent in my mouth. I thought the flavor was odd, but it left me with fresh breath and no stinging. The clean fresh feeling lasted quite a while."
5.00,"Left my teeth feeling clean and taste great. Great value for the price."
5.00,"MY TEETH FEEL FRESH, SMOOTH, AND CLEAN AFTER USING IT. IT IS A VERY ECONOMICAL WAY FOR ME TO CLEAN MY TEETH IN BETWEEN MY VISITS TO THE DENTIST. I FEEL THAT I AM TAKING GREAT CARE OF MY TEETH. IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO ME TO HAVE HEALTHY TEETH. I ENJOY USING THIS PRODUCT VERY MUCH."
5.00,"My family really liked the taste and results. Will definitely buy again."
5.00,"I loved it, works great! Leaves a clean feeling all day. Can breath on someone and not worry about stinky breath!"
5.00,"I'm just waiting for my current toothpaste to run out so I can switch! Can't wait!"
3.00,"I have been using this product every night for a little over a week. I can't tell yet if it is helping my teeth and gums or not. I went to the dentist today for my 6 month checkup and he just said I had to watch one molar that had a crack in it but nothing else. I will be going for a teeth cleaning June 8th so maybe I will know more then."
4.00,"This is a great product. It's more on the expensive side, but the quality is worth it. It leaves your mouth feeling fresh and clean. I'd definitely buy again."
1.00,"Tastes so good the kids try to eat the tube. Not helpful. Also, it stains everything blue. The sink, the towels, their clothes, their faces. Awful."
4.00,"After using this a few times, I've noticed my teeth do feel much cleaner than normal. I would not go so far as to say it's the same as getting a cleaning from the dentist, though. Overall, I do like the product and will probably use it again."
5.00,"Not a brand I normally use. After trying it I went out and bought my own tube! It leaves your mouth feeling clean with fresh breath hours after use not us immediately after like most."
4.00,"Left my mouth feeling clean without a nasty after taste. A bit pricey but definitely a great product."
1.00,"This caused my mouth to develop extremely painful lesions and blisters on the sides and underneath my tongue. I couldn't talk or eat without pain for a week. Apparently, it has something to do with the type of fluoride in this toothpaste (so I've been told). This product line is definitely not worth the risk of experiencing what I went through."
5.00,"I was surprised by all the negative reviews, because I think this stuff is amazing! I've been using it for about 2 weeks. So far I've noticed my teeth feel a lot cleaner, my breathe is a lot better, and I truly believe it is working! I have not had any symptoms others have talked about like skin peeling off or white slime. I will continue to buy this product in the future!"
2.00,"This would have been a good product if it didn't have the issue of having a terrible after taste that lasted a long time. I am one that can't stand terrible tasting items."
4.00,"only been using for a short time but My family likes it"
5.00,"After I use the toothpaste. My teeth even squeak clean and look great"
4.00,"I like this mouthwash quite a bit. It seems to foam up quicker than others I've used, so you have to spit a few times to get a full rinse, but other than that I like it."
5.00,"I really liked the taste and how my mouth felt after brushing. Love the one for sensitive teeth. No more painful tooth!"
4.00,"I actually like the mouth rinse. I've only used it for 2 weeks, but I like that it is not chalky like some of the other brand mouth rinses."
4.00,"Love this product, keeps my teeth white and feeling fresh and clean. I will purchase it again."
3.00,"This product had a good flavor. It didnt leave a bad taste in my mouth"
4.00,"The mouthwash was great! It didn't burn my mouth and it left me feeling minty clean!"
4.00,"Another great Crest product. Will continue to use Crest products, have done so for years."
4.00,"The product left my teeth feeling clean. I will continue to use the product."
4.00,"Leaves your teeth feeling very clean. The price is a little high, but worth the cost."
4.00,"I liked that it didn't taste like medicine. It made my teeth feel clean. I didn't notice whitening but that is not why I tried it. I was pleased overall with this and would buy again."
5.00,"This mouthwash is excellent. It makes your mouth feel clean without leaving a film on your teeth. No strange aftertaste like you get with some of the others,"
5.00,"this made my teeth fresh and clean. i will buy it again."
2.00,"I've used various whitening toothpastes over the years and have never really noticed any significant whitening. That's still true after using this one (though I highly recommend the 2 hour whitening strips which are fantastic). The one thing that did stand out about this toothpaste was how sweet it was, cloyingly so. It tasted like a peppermint candy. I could see kids liking this for that reason, but the super sweetness coupled with the lack of whitening means I won't be buying this again."
5.00,"LOVE THE WAY IT MADE MY MOUTH FEEL. LIKE THAT MY MOUTH DID NOT BURN."
4.00,"I liked this mouthwash but I'm not sure if I would continue to purchase it. It didn't leave my mouth feeling as stripped clean as the Listerine Total Care Zero which I was using previously. It's hard to tell if the benefits listed on the label are true because I only used one bottle, but it's certainly not a bad option if you're looking for a new rinse."
4.00,"it's my favorite toothpaste and the only one i buy"
5.00,"I really like that it covers so many problems with one toothpaste. My teeth feel very clean after brushing. I have been using this toothpaste for a year now, and so far no cavities at all. I haven't noticed my gums bleeding as much as they use too. I like that this toothpaste also has the whitening in it also. So far, very pleased with the results."
5.00,"I love how it keeps my my mouth and teeth feeling clean for hours. I love the flavors it offers also."
1.00,"I think half the tube of tooth paste of Crest Pro-Health has been on my counter or inside my bathroom drawer. I've read the comment section. Tried snapping the lid shut; keeping it upright. To no avail. There's a definate flaw in the consistency. I had to finally give up and throw it away IN a plastic bag!"
5.00,"I have used many different brands and kinds of toothpaste in the past but I have never been left with such a fresh and clean feeling for so long after brushing me teeth. It does have a very strong taste that my kids don't care for but it doesn't bother my husband or I. I have not noticed any change as far as staining goes but even if that perk of the toothpaste wasn't there I would still be buying this again. Love it!"
5.00,"I have used Crest products since I was a kid, so maybe I am biased. I liked this product a lot. The taste was good and the consistency of the paste was good. I usually like the Crest toothpaste that are more gel-based than paste based."
5.00,"I enjoy the flavor and feel of it. It was in convenient packaging and was easy to find in the store"
5.00,"I loved this toothpaste! My mouth felt clean longer than with my usual brand. My breath smelt good too. I would highly recommend this toothpaste to anyone!"
5.00,"Nice clean feel to teeth after brushing. It has a very strong mint flavor (wintergreen?)."
3.00,"While my teeth continued to feel smooth and clean, I'm not sure if it was due to the toothpaste or buying an electric toothbrush. The toothpaste did leave my teeth/mouth with fresh breath. I liked it and will probably buy it again."
5.00,"I recently tried the mouth wash and I love it. My teeth stay cleaner longer. I only use a little bit of flavored creamer in my coffee in the morning and I always notice that \"fuzzy\" film on my teeth afterwards. After using I started using the Crest rinse, I have noticed I don't have that film on my teeth like I used to. I can't wait to try the toothpaste next!"
1.00,"Been a Crest user since the 70's and despise this product, too gritty and make my gums constantly bleed, I do not see any benefit to this toothpaste.. I would avoid, in my opinion not happy at all with product."
5.00,"Love this product. Makes my teeth feel clean and my breath fresh. The best!!"
5.00,"I don't understand the low ratings. I've been using this toothpaste twice a day for over a month and I see a noticeble difference: Whiter Teeth (I say at least one shade whiter) Less tartar build-up, fresher breath, and my teeth feel clean and smooth for hours afterwards! The taste isn't unpleasant in my opinion. In fact, it's not as \"harsh\" as a lot of mint flavored products I've come across. I mean, this is TOOTHPASTE, not candy. Right?! Yes, it has kind of a grainy texture, but I think that is one of reasons why it cleans my teeth so well. It's not too harsh or abrasive for me, and I have rather sensitive teeth. This is my absolute favorite toothpaste! From now on, I'll be buying this in bulk on Amazon. Love it!!!"
5.00,"It was a great clean that stayed for a long time!!!"
5.00,"Works well, feels like I have just been to the dentist for a cleaning."
3.00,"Maybe that is the purpose of the toothpaste to keep working after brushing, but it was not a feeling I want. Definitely will not buy again."
1.00,"Quite literally, this mouthwash burned my tastes buds right off. Swishing it around your mouth can cause an intense burning followed by a swollen/numb tongue. After using it for the second time I noticed my tongue felt as if it was burned by a hot liquid or food item; my lips ached and felt \"chapped.\" I can barely taste anything that I eat or drink; most notably I can not taste anything with the first half of my tongue. I can only hope and pray that I can regain my ability to taste. It blows my mind that P&G feel comfortable selling this product without a disclaimer on the bottle about the possibility of losing your sense of taste. I will no longer support P&G and will do my best to inform others to stay away from their products. I have since called P&G to file a complaint (good news is that they will refund my $3.49!); I suggest everyone who has had the same experience should call and complain as well. Hopefully the more complaints they receive, the more they will realize that their products are harmful to their customers (even if it is a small percent). I would love for this product/product line to be removed from the shelves. However, I am doubtful because I am convinced they only care about their profit and not the lives of those who they target. Gotta love big business."
5.00,"My mouth felt fresh and clean. I liked the foaming action so you know it was really working. I will be buying this again!"
5.00,"Love that my teeth feel clean all day long. I don't get the feeling I hve to brush my teeth every time I eat"
5.00,"This Is The Best Toothpaste I've Ever Used And I Will Continue To Use It From Now On."
5.00,"This toothpaste was awesome. I liked everything about it."
5.00,"Very good. Good texture, effective and very tasty. All purpose. I would go to a lot of trouble to secure this. I hope they continue to produce it."
3.00,"Crest Pro Health Toothpaste makes a variety of claims--it protects against gingivitis, cavities, plaque, and tooth sensitivity, as well as whitening. I like think I take good care of my teeth--brush (with a Sonic Care brush) twice a day, floss daily, dentist twice per year, and use a Crest Clinical Mouthwash. It's difficult to tell if the toothpaste protects against cavities or plaque, that would take a longer term controlled test. However it's Crest, so my preference is to believe that the Crest Pro Health does do these things, or at least does them as well as a comparable product. However, the drawback of the Crest Pro Health Toothpaste is that it didn't leave that minty-clean taste. The after taste isn't bad, but it's just not as fresh as many other (including Crest) toothpastes. I'll admit that I am a big fan of mint, and mint flavored things, and tend to prefer a very strong mint taste. If you would prefer an effective toothpaste that doesn't have a strong mint flavor while brushing or after, I'm sure you will like this toothpaste. If, like me, you want a longer lasting minty aftertaste, you will likely prefer a different variant of Crest."
5.00,"It really made my teeth feel clean. Will buy again"
4.00,"Love all the features - left a great clean feeling!"
5.00,"After using Crest Pro-Health Mouthwash for two weeks, my mouth feels cleaner and healthier. My gums aren't bleeding like they were when I'd floss. My teeth appear whiter."
4.00,"I really liked how my teeth felt after brushing. My teeth felt clean for a while afterwards too."
1.00,"Although I didn't have an experience as bad as some of the other reviewers or the complaints across the Internet about this toothpaste, I did have peeling and numbness in my mouth from this product. There is something seriously wrong with the formulation."
5.00,"My family loves Crest a brand you really trust. We don't use any other brands."
1.00,"Four days ago I purchased a bottle of Crest Pro-Health Oral Rinse and it has been an absolute nightmare ever since! I used it only one time and ever since then my tongue has been burning - and I mean excruciating burning! Not just minor discomfort. I can't even sleep. The pain wakes me up! (I knew it couldn't be the approx. 10% alcohol in the stuff because the regular mouth wash I use has 20% alcohol and gives me only a few seconds of burning that stops immediately as soon as I spit it out). I also developed a thick coating on my tongue and the entire inside of my mouth. For about two days I lost my sense of taste, but that seems to be returning. I am not a chemist, a doctor, or a pharmacist (I do not want to misrepresent myself), but I did some internet research on the active ingredient in this horrible stuff. It is cetylpyridinium chloride 0.07%. I learned that this chemical can be very caustic and can cause severe burns and sores (in this case, in the mouth). After finding many blog cites with other horror stories from people who have used this terrible product, one person wrote that her oral surgeon told her to mix one part children's liquid benyadryl and one part Malox (or some liquid anti-acid product), then swish it around in your mouth for as long as you can. DON'T SWALLOW IT. I did this, and found it helpful in temporarily reducing the burning. I'm not sure how often you're supposed to do this, but I've done it three times today and will continue to use it until I can see my dentist. I have called both the phone numbers on the back of the bottle and complained to them with my symptoms. I told them I felt that I had been poisoned and asked if they had an antidote for it. All they said was they would keep a record of reported symptoms and give them to Procter and Gamble (the manufacturer of Crest products). Do yourself a big favor and don't buy this stuff."
5.00,"This product cleans my teeth and freshens my breath."
5.00,"I really like Crest products. Their whitening system is awesome... I love this mouthwash"
5.00,"This is the first time that I have tried Crest Pro-Health Clinical Gum Protection. When you get older, it's your gums instead of cavities that worry you the most. This toothpaste protects and returns your gums back to health. On the side blurb of the box, I noticed that this toothpaste is great for sensitive teeth. So when your gums are acting up, this is a great addition to seeing your dentist. My mouth felt fresh and clean. The blurb on the box states that it also fights cavities, tartar and plaque. When I use a toothpaste that is made to bring back my sensitive teeth to normal, I always worry that it won't do so good in other departments like whitening but this toothpaste does all of the above so I don't have to worry any more. I noticed that it said not to use this toothpaste for a longer than 4 weeks but with my experience, it never takes that long to get my gums in good shape again. Also, remember to change your toothpaste often, especially after getting over a cold or some other infection. I recommend this toothpaste for whenever you have gum problems."
3.00,"My teeth are in too bad of shape for any toothpaste to really have much impact. What I don't like about this stuff is that it usually leaves a film between my teeth and mouth that's pretty gross. That is all."
5.00,"I use the toothpaste, and the mouthwash, and my mouth has never felt so good. I feel good about the way I'm caring for my teeth, and in return they look amazing."
5.00,"My mouth gets so dry during the night sometimes that it actually wakes me up. I've tried special toothpastes to alleviate that, none of which helped at all. Biotene actually made it worse. Then I switched to sprays which did help (Oasis is my favorite), but I didn't want dry mouth to wake me at all. I found it helped a lot if I brushed my teeth right after dinner so as to let saliva redistribute naturally in my mouth before I went to bed (also eliminated evening snacking :). Someone recommended this toothpaste, so I tried it. I didn't expect much after trying the special dry mouth products, but voila! It really does help. I still try to brush my teeth well before retiring, but haven't had the problem nearly so much and am very grateful. Don't know why this seems to help; it's not advertised for help with dry mouth, but I'm very satisfied with it and will rebuy."
5.00,"I really enjoy the taste of this toothpaste.  It leaves your mouth feeling fresh and clean."
5.00,"My teeth DID feel cleaner longer. I was surprised at that because I didn't think that it would be that noticeable. It was great. Thanks"
5.00,"After using this product my mouth feels completely clean and fresh. I have that just got back from the dentist feeling, just like when I get my teeth cleaned. It's great, especially when used with the same brand pro Health mouth rinse."
5.00,"This toothpaste leaves my mouth feeling very clean - clean and fresh."
5.00,"Loved it made my mouth feel fresh the tingling sensation is how u know it's doing its job Highly recommend the purchase of this product!"
4.00,"I really like this mouthwash! It seems to whiten and really freshens !"
5.00,"I love this toothpaste. It made my teeth feel clean, and did not hurt the inside of my mouth like other toothpastes do."
4.00,"this toothpaste was very tasty and worked well with making your breath and mouth feel clean. Plus it made me feel good knowing all the benefits it had."
4.00,"Although occasionally the product foams in your mouth (don't know if this is supposed to happen or not), the mouthwash does a great job at killing germs without the burn of alcohol! My teeth feel clean, my breath is fresher and I have an overall feeling of clean in my mouth."
5.00,"Crest proactive makes my mouth feel so refreshed, and I know it is doing my mouth good too!"
4.00,"I'm very pleased with Crest Pro-Health toothpaste, great taste and my mouth stay fresh and clean for a long time after brushing."
1.00,"leaves a gross foam in your mouth and i lost my sense of taste, i can't detect salt!! horrible product!!"
3.00,"I tried this and loved the clean feeling it gave me but really did not care for the taste of the toothpaste. My husband ended up using this and say's he loves it so this is what I will be buying for him from now on."
5.00,"Crest has figured out how to effectively market toothpaste to the 50+ crowd. 50+ or not, it is a great toothpaste. I am nowhere close to 50, but I can't pass up a good deal. The flavor is really good, a nice soft mint but very refreshing. The toothpaste is very smooth, not gritty at all. All in all, this is a fabulous toothpaste!"
1.00,"I have been using this for about a week, which may not be long enough to fairly judge this product, but so far all I can say is that it effectively cleans my teeth. The other stuff it does, like whitening, preventing gum disease....well, who knows? I drink coffee and eat acidic foods daily, and I have other mouth hygiene routines even before using this product that help prevent gum disease and tarter build up that I can't say that this product is doing those things. The flavor is the typical mint, and the paste has a vaguely gritty texture. I find the after taste minorly unpleasant in terms of the mintyness. But it cleans my teeth, and I suppose that is what you want when you brush your teeth. But am I believer in the other benefits of this toothpaste? Not yet. So far I see myself sticking with my typical brand.UPDATE 6/18/2013Just visited my dentist after using this brand for a few months. It was my worst appointment in years. I've changed absolutely nothing BUT my toothpaste. I had more plaque build-up, some swollen gum tissue, and was told to get back to my previous brushing habits. After telling my dentist that nothing was different except for the paste, he just reiterated that I needed to do better. I take pride in having clean teeth and needing very little scraping/picking/etc during a cleaning (my mom really got it stuck in my head that I wanted to die with my teeth in my head, I took her seriously). It was definitely a WTH moment. Changing my star rating from a 3 to a 1."
5.00,"I love Crest products in general and this did not disappoint. It left my mouth feeling really clean and fresh and over time I am noticing a bit of a whitening. Overall very pleased! Thanks!"
5.00,"I have always enjoyed the quality of Crest products and I was not disappointed by this toothpaste. It tasted good and made my teeth look and feet great."
3.00,"I tried the toothpaste and it was actually pretty good. My teeth actually felt smooth and clean for longer. The only things that would make me like it more is to reduce the price and to have it in cinnamon flavor."
1.00,"My daughter was using this product and complained that it was making her mouth dry and stringy. She was insistent about using it due to its ability to \"really clean your mouth\", after using it for several times her mouth and lips became alarmingly swollen and was blistering. Immediately I bought some Benadryl and gave it to her which relieved her immediate problem. Take my advise , Your long term health is far more important than any immediate whitening!! As my dentist says, \" brushing is for debris and whitening is for whitening\". So if you're having issues with any whitening products, just stop using them! There is always Synsodyne which is a far better product!! There are far too many whitening toothpastes out there, it almost eliminates your options when you're having any issues as I've described. I additionally asked my pharmacist who told me the whitening toothpastes and the over-usage of them has become a problem, he stated that it's the fluoride in high volume that is the problem."
4.00,"I liked the product and so did my kids but I did not see a huge difference"
5.00,"Made my mouth feel clean and fresh. Loved it and will definitely buy again! :)"
5.00,"wow what a wonderful combination. the tooth paste just tops everything all off. my mouth feels extremely clean."
5.00,"This outs the wow factor into removing stains! I am an avid coffee drinker and I really enjoy my coffee, but the down side which everyone knows is the awful yellow stains it leaves behind. I have been using this toothpaste for two weeks now and I am in love with it, my hisband asked me last ight when did I go to the denist and get my teeh cleaned."
5.00,"Love it. It made my mouth feel fresh and clean. I would recommend this product to famil and friends."
5.00,"LIke many, I initially had a very adverse reaction to this product. It literally burned the tastebuds off my tongue and nothing tasted right for days. I also got the weird jelly-like glob in my mouth while using it.I had read the directions, but I assumed it was like every other mouthwash product, right? The directions looked similar: brush teeth, rinse, use mouthwash.Not quite. It's very explicit about the fact you need to wash all the toothpaste out first. That's the important step, because this stuff reacts chemically with the toothpaste and if you don't rinse it all out of your mouth, then you'll get all the bad side effects.I changed my routine, using the mouthwash first, and I'm no longer having any issues. This mouthwash is stronger and works better than anything I've ever tried. Perfectly happy and will buy again."
5.00,"Using this product my teeth feel so much cleaner. I haven't been to the dentist yet to see if it has helped remove plaque. The taste wasn't that bad either!"
4.00,"My family loves this. We love the way it leaves our teeth feeling so very clean, squeaky clean like the dentist does. Plus the flavor is great. My family asks for this type of toothpaste. Thanks!"
5.00,"great taste great feel! Everyone in my house loves how clean it feels"
5.00,"I'm guessing the price of this item is almost the same as target etc, but I have to say, I am never able to get the 5oz. at the stores. So great item to buy online"
4.00,"I enjoyed the fresh feeling I had after using this toothpaste. My breath felt fresh & it tasted good. There only only onebad thing I experienced after using this product, and it happens to me with other powerful toothpastes. It feels like a thin layer of skin inside my mouth comes off in small pieces. My mouth might be a bit too sensitive for this one."
4.00,"I love the Crest ProHealth Rinse. My breath was so fresh and it was like the finalizing touch after I brushed."
5.00,"I love the way my teeth feel after I have brushed with Crest Pro Health. I use the Sensitive and Enamel Shield. It has really helped the problem I was having with pain while drinking or eating anything really cold. Not only is the pain gone but my teeth feel squeaky clean."
5.00,"Loved the taste and the way it kept my teeth from feeling \"hairy\" longer! I hate when my teeth feel grainy and this product kept that away longer!"
5.00,"I am picky about the flavor of toothpaste and I love this one. It also feels like it cleans surprisingly well. I have always trusted crest and this does not disappoint."
4.00,"Left my teeth feeling clean and fresh. Would purchase again."
5.00,"My daughters and I am absolutely love this tooth Paste! Not only did we see results in the first couple of days, but the price is reasonable! I would definitely recommend this to my friends!"
4.00,"This product leaves my mouth feeling fresh and clean and I am glad I purchased it. However, my husband mentioned to me that he thought it left a weird aftertaste in his mouth. So I guess it leaves a different effect on each person. We both continue to use it so it's not a negative enough effect on him to keep him from using the product."
1.00,"I've always used Crest toothpaste, but I've never had anything like the texture of this. It was runny and got all over my clothes and towels. I finally gave up and threw it away. I bought another brand and it's fine. I ordered 4 tubes of the Crest and I'm not sure what to do with the remaining."
4.00,"I like it very much. It does what is intended to be use for."
5.00,"I must say that I am very impressed with the feeling I get after using Crest Pro-health toothpaste. I have a just brushed feeling long after using it in the morning. I bought the invigorating tube and even after being at work a couple of hours I feel fresh and ready to meet my customers face to face. Thanks a Bunch. One Happy Customer."
4.00,"I liked the effectiveness of the Crest Clinical toothpaste. I thought it removed plaque from my teeth really well as left my mouth fresh. The Pro Rinse also made my breath feel and smell fresh. I also had the toothbrush to use which I have really liked. I like how the handle is shaped and makes it really easy to get to my teeth in the back. I think the Crest brand is very trusting brand and would purchase again."
4.00,"Loved the Crest toothpaste, my mouth feels even more clean than usual... dare I say my mouth feels \"sparkly\""
5.00,"The pro health series gives me the cleanest feeling other than going to the dentist. I love it."
5.00,"When i used this toothpaste it did not leave a film in my mouth or was harsh on my teeth but at the same time you could tell it was doing its job."
4.00,"you can definately taste peroxide in it. i wasnt a big fan. it definately made my mouth feel clean though."
3.00,"Crest Pro-Health Multiprotection Clean Mint Rinse tastes good and seems to make my teeth feel cleaner but I simply do not like the rinses that do not have alcohol in them. The rinses that market the fact they don't have alcohol so there isn't that \"burn\" I can see why they do so but the \"burn\" is a lot that kills the bad breath for real. When I use rinses like this it feels more mental than physical and I want a more powerful rinse instead. If you hate that burning flavor that they try to market this rinse might be for you, but not all the alcohol-based rinses burn as described. ***"
5.00,"My dental hygienist said this is a good product and when I found it for such a good price from Amazon, I bought it. Great protection for your teeth."
4.00,"This rinse makes your mouth sing out in clean. It really does seem to dislodge all the stuff leftover from brushing and leaves you feeling fresh for a nice long time. I would buy again."
4.00,"Used this one for a week and noticed a cleaner feeling mouth"
5.00,"I think the reviews on here are probably a little (very?) skewed towards the negatives, since people are more likely to come on here after they notice bad things happening. I've been using this product for a while now and haven't noticed any ill effects. I enjoy the lack of alcohol. I would say that you probably should give it a test try with a small bottle to see how you react to it, then if you're one of us who has no issues, go for the multipacks."
5.00,"This is my favorite toothpaste! It makes my mouth feel super clean, and actually worked to whiten them. I've used other toothpastes since I tried this one and I can't wait to use up the ones I have now to come back to Pro-Health! No other toothpaste has done what this one has for me and for the price, you can't beat it. One thing I have to say is it's not as thick as other toothpastes, so it's a little messy, and should be stored with the cap up to avoid spilling. Definitely worth it, though!"
4.00,"This stuff is great. Very minty and fresh without burning your mouth. My teeth really did look better after a couple of weeks. My only complaint is that it left a bit of a filmy feeling behind."
5.00,"I love this rinse, I use it every time I brush and it helps to get the places my brush misses. My mouth feels clean all over and my breath is sparkly too!"
5.00,"I really enjoyed this toothpaste. I felt that it really did a good job of keeping my mouth clean and fresh."
5.00,"this kept my breath fresh and clean all day, Loved it!!!"
5.00,"This made my teeth feel very clean and my breath fresh. Gave my that just from the dentist feeling."
5.00,"This toothpaste is pretty good. I would definitely buy this from a store. Crest has been coming out with a lot of good toothpaste. It's amazing how they can keep coming up with a variety of types of toothpaste. My mouth definitely felt clean after using it. I like the top that allows it to stand up. It creates more room in my medicine cabinet and it looks good when it stands around the bathroom sink."
5.00,"Try it, you will love it!!"
5.00,"Made my teeth feel clean and left them sparkling! Can't wait till my next dental appointment, I always have a lot of plaque. Hoping to see a lot less at my next appointment!"
5.00,"I got away from crest for sometime, but now I am a faithful customer of pro health toothpast. my dentist recommended it and will stay a customer of it."
5.00,"I love the toothpaste, it kind of tingles when brushing, when used with the mouthwash the two make your mouth feel extremely clean."
5.00,"This toothpaste worked great with the toothbrush, leaving my teeth feeling extra clean."
4.00,"I have just started using this toothpaste and am pleased with how my mouth feels after using it. It leaves my teeth sqeaky clean and has a nice taste. I am not sure about its plaque control as I have not used it for very long."
4.00,"This product makes your mouth so fresh and clean. I like the way my mouth and breath are after using."
1.00,"I have been using this product for a week. I can't taste anything, my tongue feels burned, I have constant dry mouth, and I can't get rid of a horrible taste in my mouth...the exact opposite of what I look for in a mouthwash. Thanks to everyone that wrote a true comment about this product. It's horrible. They should quit making it forever. On a positive note, my dry mouth has been so severe that I have been drinking a lot more water the last few days. I haven't been this hydrated in a long time."
5.00,"This toothpaste made my mouth feel exceptionally clean. No plaque, even after a couple hours."
5.00,"we won't know until my next trip to the dentist, but my mouth sure does feel a lot cleaner after using this wash for a few weeks."
5.00,"Crest Pro Health toothpaste is excellent! My family could tell a noticeable difference the first time we all used this toothpaste. Teeth feel cleaner and mouth is fresher longer after using this product. THe price is a bit more than other toothpastes, but it is well worth it. I would recommend it to everyone!"
5.00,"Great product. I am a loyal Crest customer. My teeth feel clean all day."
5.00,"Great product! Super clean teeth! Would recommend to everyone to give it a try!"
5.00,"Crest products have never failed me in the past and this one is no different. The toothpaste helped my teeth look their best both cosmetically and healthwise - they felt squeaky clean and my mouth felt fresh."
3.00,"I dislike this flip cap. It does not close completely, no matter how hard I push, it leaks. At first I thought the leakage was my fault and I cleaned out the cap completely and pushed it shut (I thought). This is now a twice daily occurence - clean out the cap, clean off the handle of the toothbrush, close the lid as tightly as I can. Not only is toothpaste wasted every day, but it's annoying cleaning up the leakage. PLEASE, Crest, get rid of the flip cap and put the regular twist cap back. Or at least put a twist cap in the box, so we have the choice of flip or twist."
1.00,"I used this ONE time. 30 minutes after I got done using it I was going to eat (used it in the morning). I couldn't taste anything. I tried to eat breakfast and I only felt the texture and couldn't finish eating it. One hour later I tried again. Same Results. Took FIVE hours before I got my taste buds back. I wouldn't recommend this to ANYONE! It's not worth it at all. I have had other mouth washes and this is the ONLY one that did this to me."
5.00,"Crest pro health alcohol free gargle mouth was is great. It leaves my mouth feeling fresh, plus it doesn't burn like most the other gargles out there because its alcohol free. I have no clue why it has such bad reviews.I love it!"
4.00,"My mouth felt very clean when I used this mouthwash and I felt like it lasted a long time."
4.00,"I like the mouthwash. Leaves my mouth fresh. Does not have a medicine taste."
3.00,"I liked trying crest. It made my teeth feel nice. The only thing is I like gel toothpaste not paste and it was hard to find any gel. Other than that it was ok, I will buy it if I can't find my other brand."
4.00,"I like this brand because it has a good taste and foams well."
4.00,"Tried it for the first time last week and I really like it! So did my hubby. Leaves you feeling fresh for longer than most mouthwashes and has a very nice flavor!"
4.00,"To me, toothpaste is toothpaste, and they all basically work pretty much the same. I am just drawn to ones that taste great, and this one does!"
5.00,"A nice complete kit to have for travelling, but I wish they came in smaller size, easier to pack along with other necessities before you go on a trip."
5.00,"My dentist recommended I use this toothpaste. It has a nice mint flavor and is a good consistency (not to thick, not to thin\""
1.00,"I will never trust the Crest brand again; shame on you too, Proctor and Gamble for allowing this product to continue to poison so many people (Google turns up thousands of examples). My mouth and lips are not just puffy, they're inflated (picture a racist caricature/cartoon of an African American, except I'm a white guy - it looks horrible!). I can't taste certain foods. Swishing with water makes it exponentially worse. It's as if they put in capsaicin (the hot oil in peppers) for some reason. My healthy mucus membranes are being sloughed MUCH faster than what is normal. As a former professional boxer and semi-pro MMA fighter, I know pain ... this is pain. I am in pain from brushing my teeth and using Crest. I have poisoned myself by trusting a brand name without doing diligent research first, but I thought FDA approved meant I was safe - guess not. I have used this only 3 times (last night and today) and this happened mildly the 2nd and severely the third. PLEASE DO NOT LET CHILDREN TRY THIS TOOTHPASTE!!!"
4.00,"I love the fact that it didn't burn. I also liked the foaming sensation I got while rinsing. My mouth felt clean for a long time."
4.00,"I am please with this product. It had a slight medicinal flavor, but left my mouth feeling fresh and clean. I would use it."
5.00,"The product has a fresh taste and my teeth feel clean."
3.00,"This seems to work really well on any type of gum pain or a bit tongue our mouth. It heals the pain quicker than anything . i don't use it for listerine even though that what its use for ."
5.00,"This toothpaste does exactly what it says. After only 3 days I noticed a reduction in the amount of plaque that formed throughout the work day. I would recommend this product!"
4.00,"I really loved the Crest Clinical Gum Protection toothpaste. It has a great taste that lasts for a long time and you can feel the toothpaste tingling in your mouth. It gave me a great, clean feeling."
5.00,"Really a great product!!! For many years I thought I couldn't find a solution to my problem but I accidentally bought this one..at first I loss my taste but after how many minutes it's already normal.I'm really glad I found this product and I will continue to buy it!"
4.00,"I don't often use 'mouthwash' for more than freshing up my breath. I tried this product and fell in love with it. It leaves your mouth feeling clean and fresh, with the added bonus of reducing plaque. I will keep purchasing this product in the future."
4.00,"This item is good for keeping your breath fresh and teeth clean"
1.00,"I purchased the 12-pack, and used maybe 2 or 3 over a 10-month period. First, you're \"not supposed to use longer than four weeks unless recommended by the dentist\" (my fault for not reading the package on TOOTHPASTE). Second, I started experiencing a burn-like feeling in my mouth, skin sloughing off, dry mouth, pain in my throat / neck glands, and lack of taste. It was TERRIBLE! Shortly before a dental appointment, I finally put two-and-two together, and realized it may be the toothpaste. Relief of all of my symptoms started within 24 hours. Read the reviews for smaller packaging, and you will see similar complaints about this product. I thought \"Oh, it's Crest, good stuff. And whitening, and gum protection, and tartar control, and plaque control, and sensitivity?!? The more the better!\" Wrong! I still have lots of this left, and I don't even feel like I can give it away at the risk of others' health. If I could give it negative stars, I would."
4.00,"Crest has been a staple in my family for generations. I will admit, that we do have a few other faves, and we deviate from the well trodden Crest path on occaision, but we always return back home to Crest. These latest products are mind-blowing. They really prove to me that Crest has its finger on the pulse of all consumers. They keep up with what we want and what we need, and are using the science and health to do it! These products appeal to our latest cosmetic and whitening whims as well as hardcore professional Dental Cleaning! They work great and fast..keeping in time with todays \"instant\" world. I like what Crest is showing me!"
2.00,"I was a total advocate for this product. The reason is that I listened to my hygenist and they were strong advoates for it.  Of course the cycnic in me was that Crest had them in their backpocket so they'd tout anything that pays.  But for about 4 months I started to notice staining near where the bone met the gum line.  I thought it was related to me starting to drink tea but reading around, green tea is actually good for you (arguably) and does NOT stain teeth.  I thought maybe it was my gums bleeding, but blood doesn't stain unless it's dry...so I called my dentist.                                                                     Also add I purchased a WaterPik during that four month span.  I thought it was that product.  Probably the water jets stripping away at the tooth causing it to expose underneath the enamel.                                                                     They got me in quicker than I would've liked to see them typically, but this was a bit of an \"emergency\" for me.  After some discussion, they asked what rinses, toothpastes, apparatuses I've used.                                                                     I told the the following - in the last four months, I've:                                                                     - Used Crest Pro-Health Toothpaste                                              - Used Crest Pro-Health rinse                                              - Purchased and used the WaterPik                                                                     The result was a complete 180 from her advice the last time I saw her.  She told me it was the Crest Pro-Health line causing the staining.  I also had what felt like film stripping off.  To the point where I needed to take my finger and pick it off my side of my lips.  So, in a way, it was a relief it was product and not health related.  They are also a Crest advocate still, just not the Pro-Health.  I asked why the Pro-Health in particular?  They say the stannous flouride was causing these effects.  They have received complaints of sore gums and molars as a result of using stannous flouride filled toothpastes - which the Pro-Health has.                                                                     My visit was a bit longer as they had to scrape and polish off the stains.                                                                     So, today, I will no longer be using the remaining two tubes I have left from this purchase.  I remain loyal to the brand, but will no longer be using this line."
5.00,"I love crest it's the only toothpaste I use, but I prefer reach floss !!!"
5.00,"Absolutly love this mouthwash. It left my teeth clean and sparkling. Also it kept my breath fresh.."
5.00,"I used the tooth paste & mouth wash. I felt that they did not burn like some I have used. I also liked the way they made my teeth & mouth feel. I definitely would buy these again with a good coupon."
4.00,"The product performed well and I was please with it. Will continue to buy it."
1.00,"I used this toothpaste for the first time about a year ago.  I ended up with red, raw sores in my mouth, so I stopped using it after a week or two.  This past week, I decided to give it another try just in case it wasn't the toothpaste that was the problem.  What do you know... the red, raw sores are back.  I have never had sores like this besides the two times I've used this toothpaste. In addition to the sores, I also have painful, swollen areas along my gumline.  This tube of toothpaste is going right in the trash.  I would not recommend this to anyone."
5.00,"We've been using Crest's Pro Health line for a while now. One of us has gum issues, so this one has been a real help. The flavor is very good which seems to be a problem for many toothpastes developed to address specific dental health issues. I have noticed a response in my own gums, too. They seem pinker and just look healthier."
4.00,"This toothpaste left my mouth feeling fresh and clean. The whitening effect was noticeable as well. I would definitely recommend this product."
1.00,"I cannot believe I'm taking the time to review mouthwash, but this is a special case.  I might end up saving some taste buds here.                                                                     This Crest Pro-health Clean Mint Rinse is just about the worst tasting stuff I've ever encountered.  The original brand used to be my favorite, but Crest couldn't leave well enough alone.  I have no idea what they were thinking.  Did no one test this toxic concoction before it hit the shelves?                                                                     From reading the other reviews here, I feel lucky that my teeth didn't stain.  Still, I can add another voice to the chorus decrying the bitter taste of this stuff.  It's inexplicably horrible.  And it lingers for hours.  No one is exaggerating on this page.                                                                     This stuff should be recalled.                                                                     Note:  I'm writing specifically about the purple variety.  I'm not sure if the others are any better, but I'm not willing to find out.  Back to Listerine for me."
5.00,"I was previously using a competitor product of enamel shield toothpaste, until my dentist gave me a sample of the Crest version! I love it. Both my husband and myself use it and have had no complaints. It has a fresh minty taste - which gives your mouth a clean feeling. Unlike others i have not had a problem with the flip tops."
3.00,"Ever since I have been using this toothpaste, my gums and tongue have been hurting. I have never had huge dental hygiene problems, I just thought that this would be good to try. Really, I don't even want to brush as much as I used to because it stings my mouth. Give it a try, but if it starts ripping apart your gums and making your tongue sore, well, I told ya so!"
5.00,"This mouthwash makes your mouth feel refreshed. The back of my teeth feel slick and smooth. I believe this product does what it says."

4.00,"My mouth felt refreshed for hours? I loved the taste."
4.00,"Left my mouth with a fresh clean feeling. Good taste an didn't burn from too much alcohol."
5.00,"I enjoyed using this toothpaste. It left my mouth feeling fresh and clean and the taste was not overpowering to me. I felt like it got my teeth clean and they continued to feel clean for several hours after."
5.00,"I love the pro-health products from Crest! They make my mouth feel cleaner and refreshed!"
5.00,"This is my favorite Crest, toothepaste, I know when I use this product I am doing the very best for my teeth, the benefits, are amazing."
3.00,"I thought it worked well. You brush your teeth and your teeth feel clean."
5.00,"This toothpaste really helps with gum health. Since using it, I have not experienced any gum issures, as I had prior to using it."
5.00,"I must say I love this mouth wash and it is the only brand that I use. I do not like mouth washes that have an alcohol base to them. they make my mouth burn. This one tastes great, makes your mouth feel clean, and does not leave a burning sensations. I would recommend it to everyone."
5.00,"Not sure of the plaque area yet as I have not been to the dentist for my cleaning yet. Did like the toothpaste and the clean feeling on my teeth. Did not try the mouthwash as yet, but plan to. Always floss..."
5.00,"This line of products by Crest are great! Try them"
5.00,"The Crest Pro-Health Collection is the perfect all in one kit that you need to maintain a healthy mouth and beautiful smile. This kit is perfect for you to send with your college freshman and you can give this as a nice going away gift because it has everything. The Oral-B floss is satiny and smooth enough to not cause any irritation to your gums and I like that. The Crest Pro-Health mouthwash comes in a large one liter bottle and it is alcohol free. The Oral-B toothbrush is great and had the gum stimulators on the outer edges and this helps promote healthy gums. A thoughtful gift or just a nice collection for yourself and your family. A collection full of your favorite products all in one you will love it as much as I have."
1.00,"My dentist persuaded me to try this stuff after a regular cleaning--said it would prevent plaque, and had me swish with it for 30 seconds. It BURNED! While I was swishing, he said, approvingly, that this stuff \"kills germs in your mouth for 12 hours!\" Well no wonder, it probably kills anything in its vicinity. When I left and for the rest of the night, I had terrible strong metallic taste in my mouth, and when I tried to eat, everything tasted just mildly sweet--no other flavor at all. Strong, rich coffee with half-and-half and NO sugar tasted like weak sugar-water. Dinner tasted slightly of library paste and nothing else. Salt placed directly on my tongue was not detected. Why would ANYONE choose this stuff? It tastes awful, contains as its active ingredient a chlorinated compound that's used for pesticides, and many other non-health-enhancing substances like sucralose (\"Splenda\") and artificial color, and it destroys your enjoyment of food. That single dose of cellular POISON still has my taste sensation impaired after FIVE DAYS, and still the metallic taste is there too--from a SINGLE use! I wouldn't give this sludge to my worst enemy. Get a CLUE, Crest..."
5.00,"I love Crest Pro-health. My teeth feel so clean. This is a great price. I have it on my subscribe and save orders."
4.00,"My hubby loves crest and this is no different. Good taste, good product. Toothpaste, imo, has become too expensive these days, but then again, what hasn't?"
5.00,"My teeth felt very clean! Definitely will continue buying this!"
5.00,"Crest has always been part of our family and continues. It's so refreshing!"
5.00,"I love the Crest ProHealth Clinical Oral Rinse. The Deep Clean Mint variety I use has a strong minty and foamy feel that lets me know my mouth is clean and fresh. I like that it helps prevent plaque and helps reverse gingivitis. And it's alcohol free. A great product I'll buy again."
4.00,"Haven't gone to the dentist yet, but seems more effective than any other toothpaste at keeping my breath fresher longer."
2.00,"I have used Crest for many years. When my teeth became sensitive, I tried your Enamel Shield. Unfortunately, and although I love the taste of the toothpaste, the taste stays with you, including when I drink my coffee,making my coffee taste awful. Not ready to give up coffee, guess I will go back to Sensedyne...Sorry"
4.00,"The toothpase did a good job making my teeth feel clean. My husband loved it!"
5.00,"it was such a great toothpaste, made my mouth feel fresh and clean"
5.00,"This Crest toothpaste is an excellent product well worthy of the Crest name! I will definitely spread the word about the toothpaste as well as buy more!! Love it!"
2.00,"I was looking for kick-a$$ toothpaste and I had thought this was the answer...turns out , not so much! I am not sure what I was expecting this toothpaste to do but somewhere in there I was hoping it would at least brighten or whiten our teeth a little more - it did NOT do that, however I was pleasantly minty fresh for a very long time post brushing. I noticed no whitening or brightening, my gums looked no different, actually nothing seemed different with this particular tooth paste and we did pair it up with the mouthwash of the same brand and type but nope, no difference. Love the minty taste just wish we would have been able to see some sort of difference while using it. We have since stopped using this in favor of Crest 3D white toothpaste - now THAT is a kick-a$$ toothpaste!"
5.00,"I would prefer this to Listerine any day. I have not had a cavity since the day I started using this stuff. It can be intense at times, but it is ultimately rewarding. The pack of two means it will last a long time as well."
4.00,"The toothpaste was good. It left a great minty taste in my mouth. It could be better at plaque removal and continuation of benefits over time. I noticed that as my day progressed it wasn't as long lasting as other toothpastes. However, it was a good starter and really left my mouth feeling clean."
1.00,"I got this after my last dental appointment to help reduce plaque and improve my gum health. I regularly rinse before going to bed, but since using this product I found that I have cottonmouth (extreme dry mouth) during the night and when I wake up in the morning. This product claims to reduce plaque and gingivitis, however, dry mouth harbors more bacteria and promotes plaque and gingivitis. I do not recommend this product. In fact, I am switching back to Listerine."
5.00,"Combined with the other products this mouthwash leaves a cleaner than clean feel to the teeth and mouth."
4.00,"It made my mouth feel so amazingly clean. I can't wait to try the whole line of products."
4.00,"We have used Crest for decades, and only recently switched to Colgate due to the latter's lesser cost. Colgate does a good job. However, this toothpaste is a strong contender. Crest does a good job, and I have no difficulties of the sort others have described. My teeth just feel clean, and my breath fresh, after using this toothpaste. We also love Crest Pro-health Multi-Protection Alcohol Free mouthwash, which genuinely protects and rebuilds enamel, fights decay and plaque and protects gums. The real deal, without health-endangering alcohol."
4.00,"It made my teeth feel clean and the feeling lasted longer than other toothpaste. Will purchase again. I will also recommend it to people."
4.00,"I expect a lot from a mouthwash, and this delivered!"
1.00,"I was in Sam's club last month and needed toothpaste and I have been using crest cavity brand which they did not have so I bought the new PRO-HEALTH clean mint. I am so dissappointed with this product after using Crest toothpaste for most of my life. It liquifies so rapidly that I have it running down my arm before I am half finished and it has practically disappeared before I finish. I like the fact that it does so much for my dental health and the clean mint is great, but I would rather have it in a more traditional paste. It is also difficult to empty the tube when it becomes depleted so unless something is improved I probably will not buy this product ."
3.00,"This toothpaste was okay...not really any different compared to similar kinds. And especially a big difference when it comes to price."
4.00,"Good product. Leaves teeth feeling clean. Always had problems with my son complaining that the flavors in others were too strong but he actually likes this one."
5.00,"My husband and I loved the sample we received. It not only left our teeth clean but didn't leave that teeth brushed taste in our mouth."
5.00,"Crest Pro-Health Collection Kit Finally! Everything I need (dental-wise, for daily use) in one convenient bundle (kit)! *does a little Happy dance* :) * Crest Pro-Health All-in-One Medium Toothbrush: the toothbrush head (loaded with cross action bristles) is a lot larger than what is considered normal. The back of the handle is cushioned (I kid ya not!) and there are textured/rubberized grips where the thumb and forefinger usually rest when brushing. The sides of the brush head have soft gum stimulators. The back of the brush head (and along the sides) one finds the tongue and cheek cleaner. Impressive, does a fantastic job of cleaning and stimulating. * Crest Pro-Health Healthy Fresh Toothpaste: a full sized (6 ounce) squeeze tube of cool peppermint flavored gell toothpaste (with Fluoride) that is not all that sudsy/foamy (like most other toothpastes I've used). after brushing and rinsing mouth with clean water, one is left with a minty fresh feeling inside mouth. I like that! * Oral-B Glide Pro-Health Deep Clean Floss: floss is like a flat ribbon -- as opposed to a traditional thread like floss. It is very smooth, glides between teeth without cutting or rubbing too hard. If one uses a threader to clean braces, or permanent bridges (as examples) the floss loads and pulls between teeth smoothly. * Crest Pro-Health Multi-Protection Refreshing Clean Mint Mouthwash: a, use twice-a-day (for 24 hour protection -- antigingivitis, antiplaque), oral rinse that leaves My mouth feeling squeakie-clean and has smooth minty/refreshing flavor that didn't burn My tongue. :) Does the Crest Pro-Health Collection Kit sound like what you may be looking for? :) Highly Recommended! --Katharena Eiermann, 2013"
4.00,"It's toothpaste...what's not to like? We use this kind/brand and normally buy it at Costco; however, we needed \"cart filler\" and bought this (and subsequently put it in a white elephant gift exchange...)"
4.00,"Great product! But again, that is to be expected with the entire product line from Crest."
5.00,"Toothpaste has a decent taste and makes my teeth feel so clean and makes me feel like i have fresh breath"
4.00,"I will buy it again!"
5.00,"We have used the Crest toothpaste and the new toothbrush and loved this both alot. I felt the toothbrush really does a great job at contacted the different areas of each tooth. Thanks so much."
1.00,"I got a sample of this toothpaste and at first I thought it was great. I liked the flavor and I felt like it made my teeth really clean. Its now 3 weeks later and my teeth are constantly hurting. I have never had sensitive teeth before and now i do!! After reading the reviews for this toothpaste I see that a lot of other people are having this problem. Im throwing the toothpaste away immediately!"
4.00,"I tried numerous toothpastes, always looking for something that would alleviate the sensitivity in my teeth. Crest Pro Health is everything you need all rolled into one. It handles the sensitivity problem better than more expensive brands. And you have the advantages of a whitener, breath freshener and fighter of plaque and gingivitis. It's a really good all round toothpaste and tastes great, too."
4.00,"It's a really good, hard working product(s) but too expensive for my budget. Thanks!"
4.00,"I like this toothpaste, it is a quality product and tastes great. It does what it says it is going to do. I feel like I am doing something good for my teeth."
4.00,"The crest mouth wash worked well! At first it did have a little bit of a funny flavor i think because of the bleach but overall i thought it worked well and the price was affordable."
5.00,"These are a few basic requirements that Crest Pro-health seems to have passed with flying colors. This is definitely a product I recommend to anyone who wants to keep their breath fresh and their teeth looking its best."
5.00,"Great flavor, keeps breath fresh, and does a great job of cleaning teeth and mouth. I have issues with my gums, so I really need something that will prevent issues, and I believe that this product really helps."
5.00,"I have been a user of Crest toothpaste for years so this feels a bit like taking coals to Newcastle. I usually purchase the Crest Pro-health toothpaste that is touted as \"Clinical Gum Protection.\" I did not believe that any toothpaste would make my teeth appear whiter. I swear or affirm that this product does much to my surprise and delight. One small complaint: my current Crest toothpaste cap doesn't always want to fit tightly thereby making sometimes for a bit of mess. I suspect this one-- since it appears to be identical-- will have the same problem; otherwise, this is certainly a good product."
1.00,"Crest Pro-Health Clinical Mouthwash was not a good choice at all. After less than approximately two weeks of using the product, it stained between my teeth and around the gum line, which results in costly dental treatment. Plus, the rinse leaves a film on your tongue. Buyer Beware!"
3.00,"Crest Pro-Health Clinical Gum Protection provides a nicely foaming toothpaste, that leaves my teeth feeling very clean. The flavor is that signature Crest flavor that all their other toothpastes [that I have tried] have - it reminds me of those \"Smarties\" candies commonly passed out on Halloween, that come in a little cellophane wrap in the shape of a roll. This product claims to not only prevent gingivitis, but also to help reverse gingivitis in four weeks; I am unable to confirm this claim, but I would not want gingivitis in either forward or reverse. The only warning this toothpaste comes with is to not use it for sensitivity for longer than four weeks unless recommended by a dentist. Its active ingredient is 0.454% stannous flouride, which may surface staining; fortunately, this can be removed by a dentist."
5.00,"Would buy this product again! This is a great toothpaste product."
5.00,"I love this product.The taste and smell is good and it gives me arefreshing feeling.I am totally satisfied with this product."
3.00,"Nothing jumped out as any different from any other toothpaste"
5.00,"This product works very well. My teeth always feel clean throughout the day, regardless of what I eat or drink."
4.00,"Typically, when one uses a mouthwash after brushing, the alcohol content in it is enough to make you feel as if you are swishing your mouth with some type of corrosive acid. I was apprehensive about using this product, for fear that it would just be more of the same. I was very pleasantly surprised to discover that this mouthwash does not burn or sting. There is some tingling, but nothing like the your typical mouthwash. It also seemed to take care of anything left after brushing and flossing better than other brands. I would certainly buy this product again in the future."
1.00,"Too strong. It actually irritates my gums and lips. I wish it had whitening in it too. I like the crest whitening with scope."
5.00,"I was impressed with the product ,as with all of Crest products."
4.00,"After using the product my teeth felt very smooth and clean"
5.00,"This product is great. It definitely keeps teeth feeling super clean and fresh. I haven't been back to the dentist since I started using it, but I'm expecting good news when I do."
2.00,"I have used Plax and Listerine, and thought I would give this a try.CONS- Initial light minty taste is fine, but aftertaste lingers forever and is not pleasant. Licking my lips even 20 minutes later leaves me feeling like I've licked off the coating on rubber bands: you want to scrape if off your tongue.- Warning on label about discoloration of teeth: I didn't have any but it is concerning.PROS- No burning sensation and obviously contains ingredients that are good for oral hygiene.This is not something I'd use again."
2.00,"Every time I use this mouthwash I taste soap for hours afterward, everything tastes like soap.  It's disgusting.  It gets two stars because it lives up to the no burn of alcohol claim."
5.00,"I really liked the taste and the clean feel. I was surprised to see it's not too expensive either. Quality product and great low price."
5.00,"I love these products your teeth feel clean and that feeling lasts. The toothpaste, floss and moutwash used together leave your mouth feeling like you went to the dentist. Love it!"
5.00,"I love how fresh and clean my mouth felt after using this product. I would strongly recommend this product to others. It was very affordable and will continue to use it."
5.00,"Im loving this product, it makes my mouth feel like I just went to the dentist."
5.00,"my teeth felt really clean after using Crest Pro Health toothpaste."
5.00,"This product tastes good, gets my teeth clean and my breath fresh-no complaints!"
5.00,"This mouthwash unlike others doesnt have the taste of alcohol and does not burn your mouth. However, it's on the more expensive side for mouthwashes...."
5.00,"My dentist told me a long time ago to forget all the fancy toothpastes on the market and just go with tried and true Crest. And I have. Since then Crest has develop lots of add-ons to their product, all of it good. Crest Pro-Health Whitening Fresh Clean Mint is particularly excellent in that it combines breath mint, teeth whitening, and cavity prevention. It doesn't get much better than that. Crest, it's been around a long time for a reason: It does what it claims. Highly recommended."
5.00,"I loved the design of this product first of all and then was satisfied with the product's results. The taste was not too strong and my teeth felt super clean and white. I loved it!"
5.00,"When I was done using this product, I felt as if I had made a difference for the overall health of my teeth and mouth. The felt cleaner. I have bought the product again, this is how much I liked it!"
2.00,"I won't comment on the toothpaste but this tube of toothpaste is the most difficult one I have ever used.  I think they do that on purpose so it's hard to get the amount of toothpaste you want and you end of using twice as much as you need.  Then you can go buy some more in half the time.  The top that stays attached to the tube won't stay closed either.  I'd pay another $.50 just to have a traditional tube of toothpaste from which you can easily get the amount you want."
3.00,"Overall, I think this product is about average. I could not tolerate the taste and honestly didn't feel like it gave me a superior clean feeling over other brands."
5.00,"Fresh breath everyday, and healthy gums as always. Highly recommended."
5.00,"crest makes my teeth feel so clean and does remove stains I drink coffee or tea daily and my teeth are never discolored."
5.00,"Great feeling! Super clean teeth after use! Keeps breath fresh."
5.00,"My new tooth paste from now on!"
5.00,"Loved the mouth rinse!!! I use it daily. I will buy it again."
1.00,"With P&G being a consumer company, you would think that they would know that the package is as important as the product. The cap is the most user unfriendly product in my house right now. It doesn't close, and the toothpaste leaks inside my medicine cabinet. It makes me feel like I am a sloppy person and that is not how I keep my bath area. Now the question is what, if anything, will P&G do to correct the cap?"
2.00,"I DID NOT like this! It tasted horrible, made my mouth feel gross, and made my teeth feel nasty. I prefer listerine over Crest and plan to keep it that way."
5.00,"It makes your mouth feel clean and fresh and it whitens your teeth."
4.00,"It really leaves your teeth feeling nice, fresh, & clean!"
5.00,"I loved these products.They made my teeth and mouth feel so refreshed and clean. My children even liked the taste and that is hard thing to achieve."
5.00,"The Crest Pro-Health toothpaste leaves a clean minty freshness in your mouth. I felt my teeth were cleaner as well! Great value for an excellent price!!!"
4.00,"Works well. 2 tubes last me a year. Nice price. Helps prevent expensive dentist visits. What more could I want."
4.00,"Made my mouth feel very fresh and clean. Definitely recommend!"
3.00,"this toothpaste had a terrible taste so i will not be using it again."
5.00,"I tried Crest Clinical Mouth Rinse,and I loved the fresh,smooth feeling in my mouth.I recommend this product for a just visited the dentist clean feeling!"
5.00,"This mouth wash is great. I love the way it foams up when I swish it around in my mouth, it makes my mouth and teeth feel clean and refreshed. I would recommend it to my family and friends."
5.00,"WOW! I cant tell you how clean my teeth felt after using this...my whole mouth really! So glad I tried this and will definitely be continuing to use it! Im very impressed with its benefits and how healthy my mouth feels! :)"
5.00,"It leaves a clean feeling in your mouth that last. I like the way my moth feels."
5.00,"I thought the mouth wash left a refreshing feeling in my whole mouth and no acolohol to feel the burn, definitely part of my oral care routine."
5.00,"These new Crest products are of terrific quality for the price. The whitening products are comparable to those obtained in a dentist's office, at a mere fraction of the price! I will be buying these products for myself and my family regularly."
4.00,"refreshing mouth feel! very happy w/ this version of Crest. Like all the additional benefits!"
5.00,"I like this product. It makes my breathe fresh and makes my mouth feel great."
5.00,"I actually used this for about 4 weeks (1 month) before my regular check-up, cleaning and my dentist noticed a difference. There was no film after I had brushed, and I wasn't \"scraping\" my teeth by the end of the day like I would be with using regular toothpaste. I'm confident that after regular use, you'd see significant difference."
4.00,"This Crest toothpaste is from their Pro-Health line of products. It is advertised as helping with tooth sensitivity, weak enamel, inflamed gums, and surface stains. Though the gel is targeted towards the 50+ demographic, anyone who has these issues can use it. The toothpaste tastes fine. The mint is not overwhelming. The cap is the stand-up cap style that Colgate uses on their Total line. I like it because I often drop detached caps on my bathroom floor. Overall, the product works well."
5.00,"It really matters! Popular health magazines and research journals are now in agreement that among the five most important activities a person can do to enhance and extend life is taking care of the teeth. It's up there with maintaining a good diet, nutrition, exercising, and avoiding bad habits like sitting for long periods, excessive drinking & smoking. Crest Pro-health is an all-in-one toothpaste and it's so easy to use the tube, it may actually encourage you to brush your teeth! (B.F. Skinner may be right about the importance of visual cues and positive conditioning). So, since product success is determined by keeping your customers, Crest has squeezed out an excellent tactic and product. BTW, you know the big issue of \"inflammation\" making the health rounds? Besides the anti-inflammation diet, and using common sense in taking care of your environment, health teeth brushing is a top recommendation as an anti-inflammation tactic. So I guess I don't feel so goofy writing this review after all!"
4.00,"Loved how clean my teeth felt for a long time. Very pleasant taste"
5.00,"I have been using this product for several years now and have had no problems at all with brown teeth, loss of taster or anything else. In fact I go to pretty great links to continue to find this stuff."
5.00,"I love this mouthwash. It didn't have a nasty after taste and made my mouth feel very clean."
5.00,"After using this my teeth felt so clean! I would definitely recommend this product!"
5.00,"It left a tingly, very clean taste. I would definetely recommend it."
5.00,"it tastes great and leaves your breath feeling so very fresh."
5.00,"My teeth are super clean with this toothpaste! Love this product! Will buy it again."
3.00,"I've gargled with this three times so far. It doesn't have the strong - shock your mouth with strong mint taste like the others do, so I liked that. I don't feel like I'm going to choke on it if I swallow a little. I also liked the flavor. Hubby says my breath smells good and I like the fact that it's alcohol free."
4.00,"It seems as tho most products on the shelve now are more interested in teeth whitening then in proper care for your teeth. Unless you buy regular tooth paste, gels are hard to come by. I tried this product and loved the feel of it, the taste of it and that it doesn't have the whitening and stripping of your teeth like most others do. I definitely will be buying this again"
5.00,"I loved this toothpaste, because my teeth felt like they did after a dentist cleaning"
4.00,"What I liked best about this is it did not burn your mouth like most others but you could still tell it was working. The freshness lasted a long time, longer then others I have tried!"
4.00,"The product worked as promised, and I would buy it again."
5.00,"My mouth felt great after using the tooth paste. Very clean."
1.00,"Wow, this stuff is disgusting. I used it before bed and was still unable to taste anything 24 hours later. Even water tastes horrible. I'll be contacting Crest for a refund."
5.00,"I ordered a few sets of these to include in care packages for the homeless. I didn't use it myself, but they fit great in the packages. Good price as well."
5.00,"This stuff worked great for me. It left my mouth feeling actually clean. Not masked or covered up or burned, just clean. As for my sense of taste, it's still fine. Granted, I can still taste this stuff in my mouth for a good hour or so after I use it, but I don't \"clean\" my mouth then eat an hour later.( I use this after breakfast and after supper).                                                                     The horror stories of burns, sores and icky film baffle me. Perhaps some folks just happen to be allergic to the active ingredient (Cetylpyridinuim chloride). It's really unfortunate that so many had bad experiences with this product. I had only positive results and will buy it as long as it's still available."
4.00,"Fresh clean feeling after using it. The alcohol free feature is the biggest plus for this product in my opinion"
4.00,"This toothpaste has a great taste and isn't to overpowering. Leaves my teeth feeling clean."
5.00,"I love it and u should try it...Great deal and nice price. I will continue to use and buy this product"
4.00,"It is a durable floss and does not leave an aftertaste!!!"
5.00,"My family absolutely loves this stuff! It freshens breath but it doesn't burn, and it seems to make your mouth so much cleaner!!"
5.00,"I already love Crest products, with extreme 3D white toothpaste as my favorite, and these products did not disappoint. I really feel Crest does keep my teeth pearly white and feeling clean!"
5.00,"It whitens and tastes good without the pain! I love it!"
3.00,"Works for great for me, different from the regular toothpaste flavors - not bad though. My boyfriend is not a fan though - he prefers the sensitivity line. You'll either love it or you'll hate it."
5.00,"Love it. Definitely my new favorite mouthwash. Left my mouth feeling fresh and clean a lot longer than other brands."
4.00,"I love the feeling after brushing mt teeth, and it lasts all morning"
4.00,"A lot of people on here complain because this stuff can potentially stain teeth (it has mine) and perhaps cause temporary changes to their taste buds (this hasn't happened to me yet). But what are they complaining about? You don't use this because you're going on a date and want your mouth to smell pretty! You use this if your gums are bleeding and you want to fight gingivitis and worse. Gum disease can cause loss of teeth, heart disease, and even death. This is pretty much the only non-prescription product that has been shown to make much of a difference in this fight. So all the whining about the aftertaste seems like spoiled children screaming at their parents because they don't want to wear seat belts. Exactly how much difference this product can make isn't terribly well established. But there is evidence that the active ingredient in it does have a clinically significant effect. Of course, along with this mouth wash you need to floss/brush twice a day. Ultrasonic teeth cleaning painlessly removed the stains in my case. Do I like the stains? No. But I'd rather have stained teeth than oral surgery."
4.00,"i was surprised at how long the freshness lasted, and the taste wasnt overwhelming or too strong."
5.00,"I am very pleased with this kit from Crest. We have been using the Crest toothpaste and decided to venture out into the other pro-health products. I have had some trouble in the past with mouthwash and my sensitive teeth. However, this system seemed to work fine. The minty effect of the mouthwash and toothpaste lasts about average. I do feel as though my teeth look whiter after doing the mouth wash and toothpaste. I don't have any proof but feel that they are a shade or two lighter after a month. The floss is great as it has a minty taste but is a little pricey. There are cheaper alternatives if you don't want to purchase the whole kit that work just as well. I do love the toothbrush. However, I typically use a Crest toothbrush and not a sonicare or other type of toothbrush. Overall, I would buy this to avoid needing to get it from Wal-Mart as it is fairly well priced and a complete set."
5.00,"Love the product. Will be using this from now on. My teeth feel clean and it doesnt leave a weird after taste like others do."
5.00,"I love this toothpaste - I live overseas and always stock up on a couple tubes of pro-health to bring with me whenever I come back. It tastes great, my mouth feels clean, and I live to see another day."
4.00,"Anything Crest I have found to be good, not too strong of taste."
1.00,"Crest Pro-Health is a mouthrinse that has no alcohol (less burning, less drying of mouth), which is rare in a mouthwash, as most mouthwashes are at least 50% or more alcohol (alcohol is a good disinfectant). To replace the antibacterial effect of the alcohol, Crest has added the agent CPC (cetylpyridinium chloride). This is a positively charged molecule that is drawn to the negatively charged bacteria in one's mouth. CPC causes death of the bacteria through destroying the cell's membrane. Thus, it does indeed kill bacteria and bacteria is what causes bad breath, gingivitis, and cavities.The addition of CPC does not come without drawbacks however. There are two main side effects that may cause consumers to avoid this product. First and foremost, when CPC kills bacteria, and the bacteria are not removed from the teeth, they eventually stain brown. Thus, if the consumer is not extremely diligent in removing plaque by brushing thoroughly and flossing at least once per day, there is the almost certain result of brown staining. The stain will appear between the teeth, as this is where bacteria primarily reside. The stain is not permanent, and can be removed, but it can be unsightly. (Be aware that the presence of brown stain means the product is working). To avoid staining, one must thoroughly brush one's teeth and floss BEFORE rinsing for one minute with Crest Pro-Health. Since the recommendation is to rinse twice a day (as CPC lasts 12 hours), the thorough cleaning must be done each time. Be aware that Staining is furthered by the drinking of coffee and dark colas.The second side-effect is a possible taste alteration associated with CPC. Food may have a slightly metalic taste. This is not reported by all users.From a dentist's perspective, this is a good product, but it is not for everyone. Since most people do not thoroughly brush and floss their teeth twice a day, most people will experience the brown staining and cease to use this product (thus all the negative product reviews). If you are willing to do the work of a thorough cleaning twice a day, then this product will further improve your oral health by killing bacteria.The final drawback (not usually mentioned) is the price. This bottle holds 500 ml of rinse. If one uses 10 ml per use and uses 20 ml per day, this product will not last a month. So one may go through two bottles a month.This product requires much of the user in terms of oral hygiene and pocket-book cost. It is a good, safe, and effective product, however, one must carefully consider if the required motivation is present before purchasing the rinse. It is not for everyone.This manufacturer is charging over $5.00 for a product that goes for less through other suppliers. If you want to try this product, choose a different manufacturer. I give this manufactuer one-star. The product itself, in terms of effectiveness is rated 3-stars.Dr. Jim Koenig, DDS"
1.00,"I didn't know about the consumer reports about how this product was causing brown stains for some cosumers. Anyways im here to report I'm one of 3% of consumers that have suffered the bad affects of using this mouthwash. After about 2 weeks of directed use brown and yellow spots started appearing near the gum line of my teeth that have regular contact with the sides of my mouth. Then i started looking around for more information about this i found many consumers have also suffered this. When my regular dental check up came around i asked for whitening treatment and they couldn't get the stains off. The areas that weren't affected by this product became pearly white after treatment but the affected areas stayed brownish yellow. There are even law firms accepting clients to build a case against Proctor & Gamble. As apparently the FDA and P&G new about the affects and how it will stain the teeth, and the FDA didn't find the staining to be dangerous so they didn't require P&G to put a warning on the label. I cannot support a company that does that kind of technical foul practice. Consumers be warned. 3% of consumers are expected to experience brown-yellowish staining while using this product."
3.00,"The Crest Pro-Health rinse was okay. It did leave a clean feeling, we still prefer the Invigorating Clean Rinse over the Clinical."
4.00,"After I Brush my teeth with Crest Clinical Plaque Control a few time. I can feel less Plaque on my teeth."
5.00,"I loved using the Pro-Health Plaque toothpaste, it was great. My teeth felt wonderful afterwards and my mouth fresh and clean! It did not have that sharp strong taste a lot of toothpastes tend to have either!"
5.00,"This paste leaves your teeth feeling great, and that feeling lasts! With other pastes, I feel like I could brush again within five minutes."
4.00,"I love Crest's moutwash. It always leaves the mouth feeling clean and refreshed."
5.00,"Love how clean my teeth feel after brushing and how long the freshness lasts."
5.00,"I liked the way my mouth and teeth felt after using this product...could see my teeth feeling squeaky clean (like after a dental cleaning) for much longer with consistent use."
5.00,"I have been using this for a year, and never had any problems. I love it because it definitely works at keeping my gingivitis at bay. I have had good reports at the dentist since I started using it, and had gum problems before I started. I use it regularly twice a day, and even take it with me when I travel."
1.00,"after using this, my tongue swelled, and tissue sloughed off from the inside of my cheeks and gums. This paste is frightening. I am going back to Colgate total."
5.00,"This is the best toothpaste ever! It even tastes good so I want to brush my teeth more. I can't believe my teeth feel so clean & smooth when I run my tongue over them. I have already told so many people to try this out, I know they will love it too!"
5.00,"I would highly recommend Crest's Oral Rinse. After each use your mouth feels really clean and fresh. It also lasts for quite awhile unlike other rinses. It is definitely worth the cost of the product."
4.00,"I loved this product. Not only did it help me have a great dental checkup, but it gave me a refreshing taste in my mouth after brushing. Would highly recommend this."
4.00,"We've been using the Crest Pro Health toothpaste for a couple of years now, but this is the first time we've used this particular one. It has a mild minty flavor to it. It seemed to make my mouth feel cooler afterwards more so than the other kinds we've used. It may have been my imagination, since I was paying closer attention this time, but it seemed to foam up more than the others, too. Overall, we really like this line of toothpaste! We like the taste and our mouth feels cleaner than when we've used other kinds."
5.00,"Long lasting mouthwash, left my mouth feeling nice and clean!"
3.00,"the mouth wash leaves a flim on your tongue and the flavor is alwful."
5.00,"I was skeptical when I read, \"reduces plaque and even helps prevent plaque regrowth; helps prevent and even helps reverse gingivitis in two weeks\" on the label. However, after one week of use, I have noticed a discernible difference in how my teeth and gums look and feel. I was pleasantly surprised. I would highly recommend that you try this product for two weeks and see if you agree with me."
4.00,"I have been using this product for a few weeks and it has helped reduce the sensitivity of my teeth. The main difference between this Crest toothpaste for people over 50, and other Crest toothpaste varieties is the amount of sodium fluoride it contains, which is the only listed active ingredient on the two Crest toothpaste products I have. The sodium fluoride in my \"regular\" tube of Crest is 0.243%, while the amount in this \"over 50\" variety is almost double, 0.454%."
1.00,"I am in extreme pain from using this mouthwash. My bottom gums have been chemically burnt from this mouthwash. It feels like someone scrubbed my gums with an SOS pad. I will never trust Crest again! They have caused me days of extreme pain. I hope my gums will heal. I've done a lot of research since this first happened and I have read hundreds of reviews by people who have damaged gums, tongues, and tissue damage from this mouthwash. It's incredible that it is legal to sell such a damaging and harmful product!"
5.00,"This is a great product with lots of benefits keeping your teeth and gums healthy and looking great. You will have fresh breath as well. Its very gentle on your teeth and gums but strong enough to be protected from getting any cavities and gingivitis. It whites your teeth and fight plaque and tartar build up."
4.00,"I haven't used it enough times yet to know if it will improve my dentist visits, but it leaves my mouth feeling clean and my morning breath is not so bad as it used to be!"
4.00,"Crest is a reliable brand, I have used Crest products for most of my life."
4.00,"my kids really need super plaque control...this would be great for them in a lighter flavor. Otherwise - does a good job!"
4.00,"Felt similar to just having left the dentist's office!"
4.00,"Item does what it's suppose to. Squeezing gets messy as it does not flow smoothly, however this does not impact the products ulimate purpose"
4.00,"The Crest + Oral B products are good. In general, I've always preferred Crest over any other toothpaste, & this only added to my preference. I didn't have any miracle results, but still it's very good."
5.00,"After using the Crest Mouthwash; your breath feels so fresh!!"
5.00,"Crest Pro-Health Clinical Mouthwash works great.I really like how clean and fresh my teeth and whole mouth feel when I use it,without the burn.It gives me a fresh from the dentist clean feeling that other brands just do not."
5.00,"This product has an odd \"taste\" compared to other mouthwashes but it is amazing otherwise! You can really feel it working with out the harsh alcohol! When you spit it out in the sink, you can see what it grabbed! That was cool!"
5.00,"I had a great check-up at my last dentist appointment. I highly recommend Crest Pro-Health toothpaste! I am using the Plaque Control one."
4.00,"I loved the feel of this toothpaste. It left my mouth feeling clean and lasted throughout the day. I felt that it was a reasonable price for the product."
5.00,"I love all Crest Pro Health products and this one did not disappoint. Thank you for making quality tooth care products that actually work Crest!"
5.00,"I like the fact that this rinse not only keeps my breath fresh but also the multi benefits of better oral health in general."
3.00,"After trying Crest Pro Health Clinical Mouthwash I found no real difference with my teeth. The taste of the mouthwash didn't make me want to use it daily."
4.00,"We've tried many different toothpaste brands over the years and always come back to Crest. This toothpaste is another great one. It left my mouth fresh and clean. I will definitely be purchasing again."
5.00,"Great product! My husband and I both love how clean our mouths feel after using it."
4.00,"I enjoyed this product . I did not notice any difference in my teeth after the use. It is a bit pricey and I do believe that it is not necessary for healthy oral care."
5.00,"My kiddos love Jake and the Neverland Pirates so when they needed toothpaste, I knew I had to get this for them. They tell me it tastes great and it's easy for them to put on their toothbrushes themselves (they're 3 & 4). Good stuff, awesome price!"
5.00,"Every time I use this toothpaste it feels as if i am cleaning my teeth on an entirely deeper level of clean than I have felt outside of a dentist office. I love it."
5.00,"great taste and whitening is great"
4.00,"The Crest Pro-Health Collection Kit is a package for Crest Pro-Health products, which at the time of this review, were not identified on price. Consequently, I am unable to determine if the value is a good one or not, but as for the products themselves, I've used (and enjoyed) them. Because not everyone may want ALL of these, I will break them down individually below, with links to the individual product: TOOTHBRUSH -- Oral-B Pro-Health All-In-One Medium Toothbrush (individually priced at $ 4.02) Oral-B Prohealth All-In-One Medium Toothbrush, Colors May Vary, 1 Count This is a great toothbrush... the head is very large, allowing for coverage of a LOT of tooth. The bristles are firm enough to give a scrubbing feeling, without mashing against your teeth and gums, and without irritating them. One caveat - the handle is very thick, and if you use a narrow holder for your toothbrush, this may not fit. If you are interested in a manual toothbrush, this is one of the best I have tried. Star Rating -- 5/5 TOOTHPASTE -- Crest Pro-Health Toothpaste, Fresh Cool Peppermint Flavor (priced at $7 for 7.8 ounces) Crest Pro-Health Toothpaste, Fresh Cool Peppermint Flavor, 7.8 Ounce On a pure performance level, I LOVE this toothpaste. It absolutely makes my mouth feel clean and fresh. It does not foam up as much as some other toothpastes, but the effect and feel of it make this a real winner. The downside is that I think this is priced outrageously for the amount of toothpaste you receive. Is it worth that much more than a $3 tube of a different toothpaste? I can't honestly say it is. The rating gets docked for that. Also, note that this Collection gives a 6 oz tube, which is smaller than the individual item linked above. It also comes in a 4.2 oz size. Star Rating -- 4/5 FLOSS -- Glide Floss, Deep Clean Cool Mint (priced at $ 20.22 for a 6-pack) Glide Floss, Deep Clean Cool Mint, 40-Meters (Pack of 6) This is a great floss, particularly for sensitive gums and fingers. As the name states, the floss glides easily over and between your teeth, but it is soft enough that it doesn't irritate gums, if you are prone to bleeding. Additionally, it does not cut into your fingers the way a traditional string floss will. The overall result is that you may be more willing to floss, as the negative effects and pain of ordinary floss are significantly reduced. The packaging claims that the surface of the floss acts to \"grip\" particles of food and remove them better, and I can't say if this is true, but as a person who doesn't enjoy flossing, I can honestly say this makes me more willing to floss more frequently. Star Rating -- 5/5 MOUTH RINSE -- Crest Pro-Health Multi-Protection Alcohol Free, Clean Mint/Clear Mint 1L (priced at $ 14.91 for a 3-pack) Crest Pro-health Multi-Protection Alcohol Free, Clean Mint/Clear Mint (Package may vary), 1-liter Bottles (Pack of 3) This Mouth Rinse is just OK. It performs perfectly well, as far as I can tell, but I don't find it exceptional in any way. Others have reported that this product can stain the teeth, and while I have not personally seen this, I can't speak for anyone else. What I can say with certainty is that I've not been so impressed by this Mouth Rinse that I would consider it, given the claims of staining. Star Rating -- 3/5 BOTTOM LINE ------ As a collection, these are very good products. The only one that wasn't fantastic was the Mouth Rinse, and I did not have a greator negative experience with that product. If the price for the Collection is significantly lower than the individual products, this could be a great value for quality products."
5.00,"My daughter loves this toothpaste! great value for the money"
4.00,"Product was refreshing but a little pricey. I would recommend it to others."
5.00,"Let fresher morning breath ever ! I like it! EXCELLENT products"
5.00,"Ilove this toothpaste, it does everything I want it too, deep cleans, helps gums, gives good breath. Keeps your teeth looking good. I don't use anything else."
5.00,"great product. My teeth are much less sensitive after using this product. No adverse reactions. Mild whitening."
1.00,"this junk is just horrible. I have never had an oral care product leave as vile an aftertaste as this garbage. actually, i'd rather gargle with that water that collects at the bottom of a garbage pail than this."
5.00,"this toothpaste makes my teeth feel as clean as after i get them cleaned by the dentist. I love it!"
4.00,"The Crest Pro-Health toothepaste made my teeth and mouth feel clean and refreshed."
5.00,"The Pro Health makes me feel like I just left the dentist office from getting my teeth cleaned each time I use it. The taste is not overpowering and the clean lasts a long time."
5.00,"I liked this new crest ,my mouth feel cleaner ,and more refreshed."
5.00,"Great product. Left my mouth feeling refreshed and didn't burn it which was an added great feeling."
5.00,"BEST TOOTHPASTE EVER. My mouth loves you Crest! I'll never stop buying it!"
4.00,"It made my mouth feel fresh. It seemed to last longer than other mouthwashes. It had a good taste."
5.00,"I used for a week straight just to compare to my usual brand and I think I may just have to switch because I like this one better. Better tasting, feeling and results."
4.00,"I like how fresh my mouth was after using this. I would recommend this to a friend."
5.00,"This toothpaste is great! My teeth felt so clean and fresh after using it I felt like I just finished getting my teeth cleaned at the dentist!"
5.00,"I love this toothpaste. It truly makes your teeth feel cleaner and keeps them feeling cleaner for a longer period of time just as it claims to do. I purchased the entire line and when used all together your mouth feels like you had a cleaning from the dentist after useing them. The only drawback to the toothpaste is that it is a little \"watery\" or \"thin\" compared to other crest toothpastes and leaves the cap messy as it seems to run out if not closed tightly. Other than that it works GREAT!!"
5.00,"Started using it after my dental cleaning and there has been less build up when I floss."
4.00,"tastes good, leaves my teeth feeling cleaner, but the cap is poorly designed and the smaller tube for the same price makes the value not as great. more of a luxury to use than a necessity."
4.00,"Loved the clinical toothpaste. Great clean feeling. Love using it!"
5.00,"I loved the clean, fresh feel after brushing with Colgate ProHealth. After a week of using the toothpaste, my teeth and gums look and feel great."
5.00,"I have always been a crest girl but I love this even better than the original. Leaves your teeth smooth - doesn't have that gritty feel some other toothpastes have. Also has a stronger flavor that leaves your breath fresher longer."
1.00,"used it only 3 times so far and lost my taste for 3 weeks since I usedI have not yet gained back my taste sensation and hoping that I'll regain it backanyonw, who regained the sensation...pls comment, how long it took"
4.00,"My daughter has issue with bad breath and we tried all kinds of mouthwashes. This one seemed to work and continually work all day. For sure will buy again"
3.00,"Crest has always been our go-to toothpaste brand and don't mind paying a little more for quality. We have been using Pro-Health for a few weeks now and though the toothpaste itself is fine, the tube is under par. Despite our cleaning efforts the toothpaste gets in the inside of the cap. Due to the messiness of the toothpaste we will not buy again. The toothpaste is fine but nothing above average for Crest. I may revert to the simple Crest Cavity Protection with the screw on cap."
5.00,"This product definitely left me with that 'just left the dentist' feeling. It was so great to have such clean teeth! Using it with the Crest toothbrush was a great pair for fresh breath and teeth."
4.00,"Very good tasting and really cleans your teeth. Even my 12 year old likes it."
4.00,"This is a great line of products. I've tried numerous Crest products and find them to be refreshing and clean tasting."
5.00,"My favorite mouth wash is the \"No Alcohol\" variety. Leaves your mouth feeling clean and fresh without the spine-tingling burn!"
5.00,"I love the clean feeling of my mouth after I use the mouthwash. It lasts a long time!"
5.00,"I liked this toothpast because even after i finished brushing it left a very clean fresh taste in my mouth almost like I was still brushing"
5.00,"I really enjoyed trying this product. It really makes your teeth feel clean. I will definately continue to use this product."
3.00,"My disappointment is not with the product but rather the packaging. The third time I used it, the cap snapped off and I tried to manually connect the cap to the tube but to no available. Overnight, it leaked and dripped all over my medicine cabinet. It was a real mess. Ergo, I had to purchased another tube. I hope it doesn't happen again."
4.00,"I've always been a \"Crest\" fan and have used many of their oral care products in the past. Being on a whitening kick lately, I was eager to sample some of Crest's whitening toothpastes. Crest Pro-Health Whitening toothpaste in Clean Mint is certainly working as advertised. I have been using this product for close to a week now, and I already see improvements in the look of my teeth: whiter and brighter! The taste is minty fresh but doesn't burn my mouth like some over the top mint toothpastes do. I like that it is in the \"Pro-Health\" family of Crest oral care products as it seems to be a healthier choice to make."
5.00,"This product actually does what it says it will do, make your mouth feel clean and fresh. I will heartily recommend this toothpaste to all."
5.00,"After using this product, my teeth felt clean and fresh all day. I would purchase this product again"
5.00,"This toothpaste left my mouth feeling super clean and refreshed! Great taste too!"
5.00,"Loved the way the toothpaste left my mouth feeling fresh and clean. No funny feeling or aftertaste when I was done brushing. Def a keeper"
5.00,"Initially, I had a difficult time finding this products in my local stores and was really happy when I finally was able to purchase it a few days ago. It has done a wonderful job of keeping my mouth feeling fresh and clean for hours after brushing. I am eager to see if it makes my teeth feel \"fresh from the dentist clean\" for longer than my usual rinse after I go to the dentist this week."
5.00,"The product worked well! My teeth felt very clean afterwards!"
5.00,"This has been my favorite toothpaste for a long time; now it's been discontinued by Crest. I was happy to find some still available at Amazon--and the expiration date was NOT a problem--plenty of time left to use up my order."
5.00,"The mouthwash made my mouth feel cleaner than other mouthwash that I have used! I loved it!"
5.00,"Leaves teeth and mouth feeling clean and fabulous."
4.00,"Crest products are great, but I really find the plaque control does a great job in cleaning my teeth and keeping breath fresh."
5.00,"Tastes and smells very fresh and also is a rinse with great additional benefits. Looking forward to next dentist appointment to see if it made a difference in plaque levels."
5.00,"Minty fresh no weird aftertastewe loved it would definitely use again"
4.00,"This is by far the best mouth rinse I've tried. It does not have the strong alcohol taste, but still works great"
5.00,"Love Crest Toothpaste! It has a great minty but not overpowering flavor. My teeth feel clean for hours..."
4.00,"Used the Crest Clinical Pro health mouth wash this week. It felt very good in my mouth, no burning, but it left my mouth feeling fresh for several hours."
5.00,"This toothpaste is easy to use and makes your mouth feel cleantastic. Along with the floss, rinse and toothbrush, my mouth felt like it went to the dentist. Thanks vocalpoint."
4.00,"I liked the toothpaste, floss, and toothbrush. Did not care for the mouthwash. I would not be able to use it for the designated rinsing period or be able to take the flavor."
5.00,"I have confidence in the crest name. I felt like my teeth were really clean after using this product and the taste was fine."
5.00,"I was surprised by some of the other reviews. I didn't experience any staining or bad aftertaste. I like the grittiness. It feels like the texture helps to clean the teeth better. Don't know about the whitening, but maybe I have to use it longer. I would definitely buy it."
5.00,"Great taste and made my mouth feel fresh for hours after using it!"
5.00,"My whole family loves this toothpaste. It leaves a deep-clean feeling but doesn't feel gritty and has a great taste. I will definitely purchase again."
5.00,"The taste of this new toothpaste is wonderful.I feel like my teeth are cleaner. My older children also enjoy the flavor of the toothpaste. I feel confident in this brand and I trust using it for the health of my family."
3.00,"Crest Pro-health Multi-Protection Rinse (cool wintergreen) is a satisfactory rinse that does a good job freshening breath, but I'm not excited about the product. I did not experience any bad side effects with the rinse, nor did I have any moth or throat pains as a result of this product. It has a pleasant taste to me, and the clean smell of the rinse seems to last for some time. Yet I'm not sure that I would use it again since I prefer a different flavor. This kind of rinse is fine, but it just did not excite me. I prefer a stronger type of rinse."
5.00,"Have always used a white paste toothpaste and this is a blue gel type of paste. The taste is good and I don't mind switching to a gel paste. One thing I appreciated the most was the fact that the top is flip top, so you don't have a cap to drop, misplace or lose. It is a fluoride toothpaste and I feel that fluoride is a proven cavity fighter. I'll have to use it over time to see if the other claims of the healthy benefits of this toothpaste are valid. I do have a little gingivitis at the moment and I am anxious to see if this will help. It's a big fat tube and should last me quite a while. Crest seems to have been a winner ever since it first came out many years ago. I didn't buy it originally because it was a little more expensive than some other brands. It is a quality problem and worth your consideration, even if it does cost a bit more (and I'm not sure that it does any more). It's often about taste with toothpaste and this one tastes very good. I would certainly buy it again. Recommended."
5.00,"It was great. Kept my mouth feeling fresh for about 30 minutes to an hour and the taste was great. I would definitely recommend to any of my friends."
5.00,"Left my teeth feeling great. I felt like I could actually tell it was working."
4.00,"This toothbrush is fabulous. The large head with diverse bristles and tooth-picks helps you to thoroughly clean your teeth. I was impressed with the 'just-like-a-dental-cleaning' feeling after brushing my teeth."
5.00,"As i said ,cleans well.It is a great product.It is one of my favorite toothpastes now."
5.00,"I like this toothpaste, it keeps my teeth nice and clean."
1.00,"First off I want to say I bought this at Wal Mart thinking it was a few steps above other mouthwashes. I've been using it for a few days and have noticed my sense of taste is gone and my mouth feels like it's burnt (like having hot soup or pizza). I've stopped using it for a day now and my mouth is still feeling numb. I can't taste what I'm eating.. I will be spreading the word online, at stores and wherever I can to avoid any crest products.. Especially the mouthwashes. Crest is a joke. Anyone reading this, DO NOT BUY ANYTHING ELSE FROM THEM. Update: At this point I am going on principle, the money I spent on this is not as big of an issue. The thing that irks me is that these clowns at Crest are reading these reviews and DOING NOTHING about it fixing this garbage they call a mouthwash. I will be contacting my doctor and my lawyer to see if this is something I should be taking to the next level. EDIT: The burnt and numb feeling is gone from my mouth once I stopped using it for a few days. I was able to return this garbage back to wal mart for a full refund. To crest, I say this: Kindly PISS OFF until you fix the formula in this mouthwash. I hope you lose even more sales because of this review."
4.00,"Once again, Crest lives up to its name- the name that stands for quality, a good value product. The toothpaste really leaves a fresh clean taste in your mouth."
5.00,"This toothpaste is the answer to a problem that I've had for many years. Other toothpastes for adults are way to strong and irritating. I've been using kid toothpaste for years because the others, including Crest, have burned my mouth. I'm too old (70) for bubble gum toothpaste, but I've always been sensitive to the morning BLAST of mint provided by all other toothpastes. And, since I had chemo several years ago, my mouth tissues have been super sensitive. This toothpaste is sooo great that I just bought 4 more tubes, just in case they discontinue it. Also, at my cleaning today, the hygienist said the new toothpaste must be working because my gum tissue is no longer \"sloughing off\" and all looks well. I had told her about this new find. In the past, she'd given me samples of the Crest for sensitive teeth, but I still could use only a wee bit of that. She was excited to here of this new toothpaste. The Crest Pro-Health for Life 50+ is fabulous, but I'd take that \"50+\" off the label because all of the ills listed on the label are things everyone over 35 has to worry about!! If you wait until you are 50+, it might be too late."
5.00,"I liked the clean taste and because there is no alcohol there was no burning effect."
1.00,"Seems alright at first but after a while it will start staining your teeth dark yellow. Starting having a similar problem as another reviewer, where I would be spitting out chunks of bright green stuff. Simply awful, stay clear of this product. Not sure how it's even being sold. Positive reviews are likely just fake ones."
5.00,"Made my mouth feel clean and fresh. Had a nice taste to it as well, not like some of the other brands."
5.00,"I like that I can use one product that does multiple things: It whitens, freshens breath, and reduces sensitivity. A good product!"
4.00,"leaves a very clean feeling. Definetly will purchase."
4.00,"I felt it made my mouth fresh and clean. I would buy this product."
4.00,"I really felt like the Crest pro-health mouthwash is a good product. It made my mouth feel clean. My only two issues are that it is did leave my mouth with a bit of a funny aftertaste and that is it relatively expensive compared to other similar mouthwashes."
5.00,"Awesome, lather is decent, and leaves my mouth feeling minty fresh!"
4.00,"This is my first time to try it. It is not my favorite but I like it and would buy it again."
5.00,"I like the taste of Crest complete and it is not harsh on my tongue. Makes morning rituals pleasant."
4.00,"I bought this because my dentist recommended the mouth wash and so I decided to get the toothpaste as well. I love the smell - especially on my husband's breath. And the reason why I gave it 4 stars is because it makes my mouth burn. I have braces and so I have many cuts on my cheeks and gums and I bought the pro health mouthwash because it doesn't have a burn like Listerine does. I thought that the toothpaste would be the same, but I was wrong."
1.00,"I do not want to spend 1/2 hour trying to find the type and flavor toothpaste I want - they all look alike I want the original paste -- not gel or different taste. At the store there is a wall of toothpaste and it takes 1/2 hour to find what paste i WANT and by then I forget to check the flavor. the boxes are all alike I bought crest prohealth -- clean cinnamon- it is terrible tasting it dried my throat I am coughing 1 hr after brushing maybe this would make good sinus drip med. I have used crest since 66 --yes 1966 I will be looking for a different brand today"
4.00,"I loved using this product on my teeth. It left my teeth very clean and it really did everything that it said. I would buy it at the store and use for a special occasion to really have a great smile."
5.00,"Saw a big improvement my overall oral health from using this product. Would highly recommend."
3.00,"Crest has been the toothpaste that just about every dentist I have seen in my life recommends and the one supply a tiny tube with the OralB toothbrush and small container of floss. This has a nice minty taste and my mouth feels fresh and clean for a while after I brush. Just about all toothpaste will provide the same level of care for much less. During the winter, I have to use toothpaste for sensitive teeth and like all the Crest products their sensitive toothpaste is too expensive and other brands work just as well. I would buy this brand if it on sale, but otherwise not. I rated it with three stars because although it does work it is not an exceptional product and the cost is a deterrent"
5.00,"It is difficult to know exactly what to say about a mouthwash, but I will say what is important to me. I have used a variety of mouthwashes over the years. Several years ago I switched to Crest products and have continued because they have improved in line with others, while retaining the qualities I liked at first. This one is imposingly named Crest Pro-Health Multi- Protection. I honestly cannot speak to the numbers of germs it kills or injures, but according to my dentist my mouth health has been great. Aside from that, what I like is Crest's refreshing mint flavor (although I am not usually a fan of mint). Pro-Health is alcohol free, which concerned me at first. One thing that I really like about a mouthwash is a mild astringent feel. It makes the mouth feel clean. I had attributed this to the alcohol, but apparently not so. Pro-Health still has that great fresh taste, leaving your mouth feeling truly clean. Yet it does not have that horrid taste of that famous brand that leaves you mouth feeling like even your breath will kill most living things. Crest gives your teeth a nice clean feel as well. This is my mouthwash, I can buy any I want, I buy this. Perhaps enough said."
5.00,"It taste great and makes your mouth feel amazing!! I'm not a big mouth wash user but after using this one I LOVE it and don't go a brushing w'o using it!!!"
5.00,"This product makes my teeth and mouth feel so clean! Great product, highly recommend."
5.00,"We absolutely love all things Crest Pro-Health, but especially the toothpaste! My husband refuses to use any other kind! My teeth always feel super clean after brushing and the feeling lasts for hours."
4.00,"Really didn't seem any different than normal toothpaste."
5.00,"This product is every bit as good (or better) as the prescription toothpaste my dentist was prescribing to me. In fact, I'd call this toothpaste better because it leaves a minty taste behind. The prescription toothpaste does not."
5.00,"Great product overall; leaves mouth feeling fresh; taste is not strong like a traditional Listerine"
4.00,"I attend classes at night after work, and to keep me awake I keep a steadly supply of candy in my mouth. By the end of the class my teeth usually feel like they are covered in plaque so I have to run home to brush them. With this toothpaste, my teeth feel much less coated with sugar. I will purchase a full sized tube to make sure my theory is correct."
4.00,"I felt this product worked quite well. It was easy to use and was refreshing as well. the price I paid was comparable to other similar products from competitor brands."
4.00,"I really enjoyed trying this Crest toothpaste. It left my teeth feeling very clean. I think it had a pleasant fresh taste. Most of all, I enjoy using it with the other products are part of a cleaning routine. I trust the Crest name, and know it is delivering the best cleaning and plaque control."
5.00,"I absolutely love Crest ProHealth Toothpaste! It leaves your teeth feeling sparkly clean and has a great flavor! Even my 5 year old and 11 year old daughters liked it and they brushed their teeth for more than two minutes! The product has an excellent value for the price and is an excellent value!"
5.00,"My teeth feel clean and refreshed. I really love it."
5.00,"I really like all Crest products, and this one did not disappoint. It did not burn like so many other mouthwashes and it left my mouth feeling super clean and healthy."
5.00,"My teeth felt clean and fresh long after brushing. It was really invigorating and I just felt like my mouth was protected. Good job on a great product!"
5.00,"Crest Pro-Health Multiprotection Rinse is SUPERB...Cool-Wintergreen is best flavor...Crest has one that's blue, but it transferred that blue to my gums and teeth...read it's back label..Wintergreen tho has no color transfer, great taste and no alcohol which even tho minimal in each bottle will add to the destruction of your teeth...This should be your \"rinse for life\".."
5.00,"The toothpaste made my mouth feel so clean,like I just came from a visit from getting my teeth cleaned. It has a fresh taste. I am very happy with this toothpaste. I will continue to purchase it."
5.00,"This rinse leaves your mouth feeling fresh and clean. It is a great product!"
5.00,"Wanted to let you know how much I loved the new Crest Pro Health Clinical toothpaste. i have been using Crest on and off for 40 years and have always enjoyed the clean feeling and especially the taste. The flavor of this toothpaste is perfect. Not too strong, not too mediciny. It honestly makes my mouth feel clean and my teeth just feel so smooth. I like the fact that it protects against cavities. At my age (52) I worry about my teeth deteriorating. It's nice to have a product protect me in the long run. I will continue to use this product. Thanks Crest!"
5.00,"My teeth feel clean for hours after using, and I've never experienced that with another toothpaste. Its active ingredient can occasionally cause staining (according to the box), particularly if the teeth are not adequately brushed, but the dentist can remove these stains. I have not had any staining, and I've used this product for around 5-6 months. I have not had a problem with my mouth becoming irritated either as some of the other reviewers have mentioned."
5.00,"I LOVE this toothbrush! Massages and cleans very well! Thanks so much!"
4.00,"I just went for my regular checkup at the dentist and the hygienist said my teeth looked fabulous. The dentist said to keep doing what I was doing and using."
1.00,"Crest Pro Health Clinical mouthwash stained my teeth . the more I brushed (after each meal), flossed (twice a day), and rinsed, the more hideous the staining became. I thought I had a metabolic disease. When I went for my cleaning and asked my dentist if anything could be done to stop this awful staining...dark brown around gum line and in between teeth...he asked if I had changed my dental products since the last visit. When I told him yes, and that I had been using Crest Pro Health Clinical for four months,he told me that he's seen many patients who used this product and had the same problem with staining. I went on line and found hundreds of similar complaints. The Crest Pro Health web site addresses is by essentially saying that the brown staining is a sign that it's working!!!!! Great! Healthy, brown stained teeth...just what I was hoping for when I bought P&G's \"most advanced rinse ever. The only thing that is outstanding about this product is the hyped-up advertising that makes no mentioned of the staining side effects. They say it only shows up in a small percentage of cases...but looking at the complaints...my guess is that they are wrong, and I suspect that they know it but stand to loose a lot of money if they told the truth. What a disgrace."
4.00,"really felt like it worked. teeth certainly felt clean after."
5.00,"Mouth felt fresh and clean. This was great. Haven't tried other products yet but plan to."
3.00,"The price was more than others, and it didn't feel/taste different and my mouth/teeth didn't feel any differently."
5.00,"this is my new favorite! it really cleans & is long lasting."
4.00,"This mouthwash is great to use. It really makes your mouth feel clean for an extended period of time after using. Nice minty flavor without being too 'hot'. The only slight drawback is that the flavor is a little medicinal tasting."
4.00,"This toothpaste is a high-quality product. It cleans my teeth well!"
5.00,"This product works great by keeping my teeth clean and my breath freshened."
5.00,"Great tooth Brush...very soft and the brisiles are shaped just right to get all my teeth clean."
4.00,"I've been a Crest user for a long time and continue to be satisfied with this product."
5.00,"This product cleans extremely well and made my teeth feel squeeky clean."
5.00,"Crest Night Clean tastes good and doesn't burn. Some reviews say that the directions tell the consumer to rinse for one minute. This isn't the case. It's only for 30 seconds. Rinsing with any mouth wash for one full minute would of course hurt and may cause damage. As for browning of the teeth, in the extended time I've been using this, I haven't experienced any staining. If anything, my teeth are whiter than ever. If you use this product according to the instructions on the bottle, the results are wonderful. Caution of course should be used if it hurts or limits taste, seeing as it could be an allergic reaction to one of the chemicals in the product. Overall, this is a great mouth rinse and does it's job."
4.00,"Great product. I wouldn't eat or drink for 30 mins after using though."
5.00,"My dentist recommended this product to avoid harsh gum dry out caused by regular mouth wash. I use this daily in my water pick and this works well mixed with water, a cap full for the full water pick load works well. Or 1/2 cap for 1/2 a load etc."
5.00,"This product is amazing. I can feel that my mouth is cleaner after gargling. It taste good as well."
5.00,"very good clean feeling tastes great too. easy to squeeze tube. nicely priced"
5.00,"my kids like it. we try different brands and this one seems to get the kids going to brush their teeth faster."
4.00,"Even my husband was excited a noticed a difference with this mouthwash vs. our other mouth wash. The Whitening is a great added bonus to the wash."
5.00,"It leaves your teeth very clean and leaves your breath fresh. It isn't too harsh and works very well."
1.00,"I have never written a review on Amazon before but am so horrified by what this demon's spittle has done to my mouth that I felt compelled to do so. I had my first cavity a week ago at age 25 and decided to improve my dental routine to avoid future ones; Crest Pro-Health seemed like an ideal product for doing so. In retrospect, I should have pushed over the Duane Reade store display to save myself and other unsuspecting customers from the unpleasantness that followed. I used the mouth rinse once on Saturday night and once on Sunday morning. By Sunday afternoon, I was experiencing pain at the top of my right jaw / bottom of my right ear whenever I yawned. All day, it worsened. Not realizing that the mouth rinse was the culprit, I again used it on Sunday night and Monday morning. By this point, the tip of my tongue had begun to burn terribly. I suspected that the mouth rinse was behind that and searched online to see if anyone else had experienced the same problems. I found that not only was the burning common with this product, but the terrible jaw / ear pain and swelling was as well. The inflammation seems to stem from the lymph nodes or the parotid gland. I suppose that I should consider myself lucky since I have not yet lost the ability to taste food and that my teeth have not yet turned brown, as a number of customers have also experienced. I am heading to urgent care now to find out whether or not I need further treatment, to find out what exactly is wrong, and to have my symptoms documented. Needless to say, Crest and the FDA will be contacted afterwards. I am beyond enraged."
3.00,"2. Flip on-off cap, especially with the runny consistency of the product, consistently leaks and makes a BIG mess on the bathroom counter."
1.00,"As many others have noted, this product has a very significant side effect: numbing of taste buds for several hours to several days. Very odd. Again, like many others have noted, it feels as if tongue has been burned. This side-effect is not disclosed on the packaging and given the number of respondents complaining this does not seem to be affecting only a few. Seems to be majority. I have ceased using the product. Suggest others do as well."
5.00,"all of the Crest Pro-Health products are excellent. I especially like the toothpaste because it not only helps with sensitivity but protects from gum disease."
4.00,"I absolutely love this toothpaste. I've tried many and always come back to this one."
4.00,"Great product. Leaves you feeling fresh and clean."
5.00,"Loved the Crest pro-health toothpaste. It leaves such a great clean feeling in my mouth without a weird aftertaste. It truly seems to be a quality product!"
5.00,"I love the Pro-Health line of products. I use the Gum Defense toothpaste every day and am confident that my teeth are clean. I highly recommend them to anyone."
1.00,"This product is labeled almost eactly the same as the Flouride Crest....It does not have flouride. So then what is the point. Crest should be ashamed of themselves for offering this junk....No point. Don't buy ....."
4.00,"My dental health isn't the best, but I thought I would try out this product anyway. I was actually surprised that it cut out most of the plaque my tooth brush wouldn't. But I still don't like the taste."
4.00,"My teeth felt great after using this toothpaste - almost dentist clean!"
4.00,"This toothpaste made my mouth feel fresh and clean for hours!"
5.00,"this product is really good"
4.00,"I liked the toothpaste the most because it let my teeth feelin clean and fresh breath that lasted a long time."
5.00,"It had a very pleasent taste left your mouth feeling refreshed and lasted a long time. I have noticed an improvement in oral health since using this product."
4.00,"This rinse left my mouth feeling clean and fresh. It was not clinical tasting or too strong."
5.00,"This is a good product that made my teeth feel clean and look good."
4.00,"Clean feel and great taste. Felt fresh for a long time"
5.00,"Crest Clinical Rinse was very refreshing. It really made my mouth feel clean without the burn of alcohol. I do wish it had a teeth whitener. That would make it prefect."
2.00,"This toothpaste left my mouth feeling less than fresh. Initially, it had a great feel and minty taste. However, shortly after use that fresh feeling left."
5.00,"I was given a sample of 3D White. It claims to remove up to 80% of surface stains in 14 days.  The active ingredient is Sodium fluoride 0.243%. It claims to whiten by removal of surface stains, fight cavities, remove plaque and refresh mouth.                                                                     Normally I use                                               . The Pro-Health claims to help with cavities, gingivitis, plaque, sensitivity, tartar, whitening, and freshens breath. The active ingredient is Stannous fluoride 0.454% (0.16% w/v fluoride ion).                                                                     I do not notice a great whitening effect, however I am a coffee drinker and I don't think that helps. I noticed a few little whiter spots. I like to have the \"enamel shield\" so in practice what I have been doing is using that one in the morning and the 3D White in the evening. I will buy both products again."
5.00,"I would recommend the toothpaste. I am very happy with the results. I can see a difference."
5.00,"Toothpaste has a great flavor - not too minty or strong, and cleans well. My husband and I both love this toothpaste!"
4.00,"I tried the Crest Pro-Health Clinical toothpaste. The taste was good and I did feel kind of a sparkle in my mouth after I was done brushing. The difference I noticed from other toothpastes is that my mouth felt fresher in the morning after sleeping all night. That's a good thing!"
4.00,"Pleasant taste and texture. It's hard to say much about a toothpaste beyond that; Crest is making some bold claims about this new formulation, but the particular toothpaste you use doesn't matter nearly as much as how often and how thoroughly you brush. Having an appealing toothpaste helps you do that. My only gripe about this toothpaste? Because of its marketing, the label on the tube says \"Selected for Ages 50+\"... which makes it a slightly embarrassing product to have lying around your bathroom, especially if you're young (or in denial). That's unfortunate, because there's no medical reason why young folks shouldn't be using this minty-fresh toothpaste."
4.00,"I loved the way it made my whole mouth feel clean."
5.00,"Thank-you very much!"
5.00,"I love this stuff, your mouth feels so clean and you don't feel like anything was left behind."
3.00,"This is a great product. I like that it doesn't have an alcohol taste to it."
5.00,"We love the way this mouthwash tasted and lasted! We have already suggested it to others to try!"
4.00,"I like the crest pro-health toothpaste. The nighttime formula is great too, keeps my breath fresh."
4.00,"This is a good product and worth the money. Don't think it is quite as effective as they say it is, but it does work well."
5.00,"Both my husband and I use this mouthwash daily and we love it."
1.00,"I had been using Crest Pro-health Clean Mint but later, when comparing the efficacy of Listerine v. Crest Pro-Health, I found some dental discussion boards and more than a few reviews which alleged that the blue mouthwash stained people's teeth. P&G even admits it, thus you'll find a warning to this effect on the rear label of every bottle of Crest Pro-Health no matter the tint of the mouthwash (yes, even the clear mouthwash contains this warning). I immediately dumped the remainder down the sink even though I hadn't experienced such negative results (yet). I didn't want to risk getting blue teeth. I took a chance on this product because I bought into the advertisement stating that it is the most effective way to keep a clean mouth months after a dental cleaning. The mouthwash is clear - so, no problem, right? The taste isn't all that pleasant, but I attribute that more to the hydrogen peroxide than anything. I figured that if the product worked well in keeping my teeth clean then I could eventually get accustomed to the taste. Unlike other reviewers, I never experienced any swollen glands, but I can't speak to whether or not I experienced loss of taste because I only used this product in the evening right before bed. What I can say, though, is that after using the product every evening for the past month or so, I have noticed dark stains between the gaps of my teeth. It looks as if my teeth are rotting! This seems odd for someone like myself who flosses every day, brushes twice a day and uses two types of mouthwash. The only rationale points back to the warning label (again) on every bottle of Crest Pro-Health. Do a simple Google search and see for yourself the number of complaints related to the Pro-Health mouthwashes and tooth staining."
5.00,"we all noticed the difference.. since using all of the products.. whiter teeth, fresher breath!! I will keep buying all of products and recomend them highly!! Plus my 13 year old.. loved that mouth wash didnt taste like alchol!!"
5.00,"I definitely will continue to purchase Crest Pro Health"
5.00,"my mouth and breath seemed to stay fresher longer and my teeth got whiter"
5.00,"Crest is always a good value but when you can find it on Amazon at a good price and it arrives quick and undamaged; it is a GREAT value."
4.00,"I have recently tried many of these pro-health, new toothpastes and I have to say crest is the one that has worked better. It leaves my teeth with that clean feeling, smooth and fresh. I loved it!"
5.00,"My teeth felt just about as clean as leaving the dentist chair."
3.00,"I really like Crest 3D White. If given a choice, I would still get that over this."
5.00,"This product is great. It made my mouth feel refreshed and clean without the burn of some other mouthwashes."
5.00,"I have always been a huge fan of Crest. I shudder at the thought of using any other toothpaste. This toothpaste might even rival the clean feeling after leaving the dentist's office!"
5.00,"I recently started using this product. I have really noticed a cleaner and longer lasting feel in my mouth. My husband has enjoyed it as well."
5.00,"I loved this mouthwash. It didn't have an over powerful flavor and it left my mouth feeling clean."
2.00,"I used this toothpaste for a year and started to have very bad brown staining on my teeth. I thought it was just me not brushing well, but since reading reviews of other people having that problem, I have stopped using it. I switched back to a sodium fluoride toothpaste and the stains are disappearing very rapidly (within a few days my teeth were noticeably brighter and the really bad staining between my teeth is coming off as well). However, my boyfriend was recommended to use this by his dentist and has been using it for years with no problems. It just depends on who you are if you will react to it."
4.00,"It made my teeth feel very fresh and clean. I liked the taste but I thought the price was a little high."
4.00,"Crest Pro-Health mouthwash is one of the best. I love how there is no alcohol taste or that gross aftertaste you get from the competitor. Works better than any other I've tried and one that I will stick with for a long time."
5.00,"I have very sensitive teeth and gums and I am always trying to find a toothpaste that is soothing that will keep my mouth from hurting so bad, and the Crest Pro-Health Clinical Plaque Protection toothpaste helped to relieve that problem. I did not have pounding tooth pain or gum soreness using this toothpaste, which I now use on a regular basis."
5.00,"I recommend Crest Pro Health Rinse to anyone. It leaves your teeth feeling fresh & clean for hours. Great job Crest!"
5.00,"this product was great it really clean my teeth and they looked great too"
5.00,"This is one of the best toothpaste I have tried used. Like it very much felt freshness through out the day!"
5.00,"Unlike some other reviewers who had issues - i love this product and have had no issues with my teeth, gums, or the lining of my mouth; and i have very sensitive teeth and gums. I recommend trying the product for yourself and coming to your own conclusions. I just bought 6 tubes because i can't get enough of it - go figure. My teeth have become less sensitive and my teeth and gums feel healthier since i started using this product. I have even started to brush 3 times a day because i actually enjoy the result."
5.00,"Taste is great. Mildly gritty for a fresh clean brushing. Can not find this in the stores. Crest Pro-Health NIGHT toothpaste my favorite."
5.00,"Normally I can't use mouthwash because the alcohol just tears up my mouth but I really liked this one! Worked great!"
5.00,"My teeth feel great and also feel clean with this toothpaste. I will recommend to others."
5.00,"This toothpaste cleans your mouth with minty freshness and the taste is not bad either."
5.00,"I was pleasantly surprised by how fresh and clean my mouth felt after using this toothpaste!! The flavor did not leave an aftertaste, and it really made my teeth feel smooth and clean afterwards. I am very picky with the toothpastes I use, and have very sensitive teeth, but this variety of Crest didn't irritate my mouth at all, and I really liked it. I highly recommend this toothpaste."
5.00,"I have tried Crest Pro-Health products before and loved them all. the toothpaste for plaque seems to keep my teeth cleaner. when i wake up in the morning after brushing my teeth the night before, seems to have kept my mouth cleaner and i have seen less plaque. WHen you add the other products, even better."
5.00,"This is my husband's favorite mouthwash. It keeps his mouth feeling clean and fresh. He likes to use it especially before bed after brushing his teeth."
5.00,"I tried the Pro Health Clinical Gum Protection and I love it. It is great for sensitive teeth."
5.00,"I love that clean feeling, and I like knowing that the product works well for my entire family."
5.00,"Crest Pro Health clinical rinse was easy to use with no burning sensation when rinsing and no bad after taste. It made my breath fresher and my teeth felt cleaner."
4.00,"It's flavor is great...something I can use everyday. It's not so hot tasting as other moputhwashes are. I'll be staying with this one for awhile...happily :-)"
4.00,"This toothpaste made my have Squeaky clean teeth!!"
1.00,"I used the product once or twice before and had the lost of taste occur so I decided to try it for a weekend. FIgured maybe with longer use it would be better. Nope it was worse. I am not sure how long it will take to get my taste back but my tongue is essentially burned (I have a sensitive tongue to begin with). Went to the dentist for routine checkup and told her about the effects and she mentioned that reports said 1 in 10 using some of the new mouthwashes reported they either had \"burned\" tongues or skin peeling off. Time to go back to Listerine. I would advise against using the product after trying it once if you lose your taste for more then a day."
5.00,"So, I buy mini toothpastes constantly at over $2 a pop. I like to keep one in my purse, my ever overused overnight bag, my \"fun\" bag (we'll call it), and my gym bag. This is the answer to having toothpaste in every possible location of your home, office, car, or gym bag. It's toothpaste. It works just like toothpaste. Price per unit is way cheaper than buying individually. I'm thinking of putting it in gift bags and giving it people I don't like very much, that need to take a hint to freshen up. Multi-useful awesomeness in a tiny tube. Need I say more?"
5.00,"Makes my mouth taste super fresh and my teeth super clean. Highly recommend!"
5.00,"The Crest Pro-Health line has several different flavors of mint. Fresh mint, smooth mint, clean mint and invigorating mint. How much mint do you actually need? It's refreshing to have a non-mint option. I like the wintergreen flavor. It's refreshing and a nice change from the usual mint."
1.00,"Contains Stannous Flouride instead of Sodium Flouride, which the warning on the back of the box says can stain your teeth."
5.00,"Enjoyed using the Crest toothpaste. Your breathe and teeth feels so clean. I will definately purchase this product again."
5.00,"The best! My teeth feel super clean and also fresh breath. Whitens as it cleans . What more would you need?"
3.00,"The toothpaste tastes good. I didn't notice a difference in effectiveness between this and my usual toothpaste."
5.00,"The paste had a good texture as well as taste. I did see results within a week."
4.00,"This is a good product and keeps your mouth feeling clean."
5.00,"Such a great product. Only after 2 weeks of using it I see and feel dramatic changes. I love the taste of this paste as well. My gums have changed to a much lighter shade of pink and they look healthier than they have in years even with regular brushing with other products including other crest pastes. I am excited to see further improvements as I continue to use this product every day."
5.00,"worked very well. fresh taste. cleaned my teeth wonderfully."
5.00,"My son has lots of dental work that plaque loves to stick too, this has been the only product we have found that really gets his teeth clean. After about a week or so of use we both noticed that the \"just brushed\" feeling lasted longer. We are more than happy and recommend this product!"
4.00,"This is a good product as it's one of the only hydrogen peroxide washes that also has another active ingredient, CPC. This means you don't need a whitening rinse and a mouthwash. It's quite a bit better tasting/feeling than most whitening washes and seems to have less hydrogen peroxide than they do.There is an issue with the labeling though.Leaving hydrogen peroxide in your mouth afterwards isn't a good idea. As other reviewers have stated, it can cause sores or burns and loss of taste. The worse health your gums are in (bleeding etc) the worse this can be.The issue is that because they are marketing it as a once after brushing mouthwash they don't tell you to rinse with water afterwards. That obviously reduces it's ability to last long. Personally I don't want mouthwash lasting a long time but marketing wants it to.I would rinse with water for any wash containing peroxide, and I think it's OK to rinse out CPC/CHX based washes as the time in your mouth is sufficient. Also both CPC/CHX can stain your teeth as well depending on makeup/dental health. If it makes you feel better a 15-30 seconds longer wash can help make up for rinsing with water.I also feel It's not a good idea to swallow much CPC anyways so a rinse with water helps that.Regular Fluoride based mouthwash should be left without rinsing or eating for at least 10-15 minutes for it to have it's effect and regular listerine formula is also ok without rinsing.I have had no issues with this product when rinsing with water afterwards and it is helping to keep my teeth white and kill bacteria without a second product/rinse. As I use with a fluoride/recaldent toothpaste I have remineralization and enamel building products and then antiseptic and whitening with the rinse so I am getting 4 active dental ingredients daily with 2 products.It could certainly taste better and not leave a film, but that's not possible with any peroxide wash."
4.00,"Mouthwashes often have a burning/alcohol taste to them...not the new Crest clinical mouthwash! It has a pleasant taste that still manages to get the job done and leaves your teeth/mouth feeling fresh for many hours."
2.00,"The toothpaste is great and really makes your mouth feel fresh. I would not buy this again though due to the cap on the product. It will not shut completely and the toothpaste runs out as it is not very thick. You have to prop the tube up on something to keep it from leaking. Very bad packaging. About ready to throw it out due to the mess but hate to waste the money. Don't buy until they change the packaging!!!"
5.00,"My teeth felt amazing after using this toothpasted!"
1.00,"After using this product for two weeks by cheeks and inside of lower lip became red and rough. The next day white \"canker sore\" eruptions occurred throughout my mouth. I have never had more than one canker sore in my mouth at a time in my life. My dentist said it could have been an a reaction to a new toothpaste, and bingo, I knew it was this stuff. HORRIBLE! I haven't been able to eat anything more than vanilla ice cream, milk, and white bread for 4 days now. The pain is horrible and unrelenting. No over the counter remedies are helping, and I've purchased them all. Similar reports are all over the internet. Be careful!!!!"
4.00,"Makes you feel fresh and clean after brushing! My son is just moving into \"adult\" toothpaste and not the gummy flavored stuff and he loves this as well!"
5.00,"As long as you use it everyday as part of your teeth-cleaning routine you will see great results! Great fresh taste!"
4.00,"This is a good product. Leaves teeth feeling clean and is refreshing."
5.00,"I really like the flavor of this toothpaste.  I had a free, small sample from a dentist and used it nearly every day at the gym.  It leaves a fresh taste in my mouth for longer than other flavors, but I might notice the flavor lasting longer because I'm working out and breathing harder.  My free sample is almost gone and I prefer this toothpaste flavor over what I have at home, so I bought this two pack.  I'm going to leave one at work and put one in my travel bag.  I wish Amazon offered the travel size, as far as I know, Amazon does not currently."
4.00,"After using it for a week, I did notice that my teeth felt cleaner. I am excited to see what the next month will bring!"
4.00,"I don't really like the taste of it, but that is the case with most washes. This does leave my mouth feeling clean though."
3.00,"i need to use sensitive tooth toothpaste, and have been using crest for awhile. i much preferred their basic one without the enamel shield pro-health or whatever is different with this, which i would give 5 stars. i didn't see it so ended up buying this. if i leave it in my mouth too long, it's an unpleasant feeling, kind of like having an altoid in your mouth for too long."
4.00,"I love this crest mouth rinse. It left my mouth feeling like a breathe of fresh air....this is a product that I would definitively purchase again"
5.00,"I enjoyed this product. It works very well. I recommend it."
4.00,"I was a little surprised with the foaming action of the toothpaste, but it felt nice. It left my mouth feeling clean and fresh!"
5.00,"I'm obsessed with my mouth and teeth feeling clean, and this toothpaste did not disappoint! LOVED IT!!!"
5.00,"I was extremely pleased at this product, we tried the toothpaste and mouthwash! I was a bit taken a back at the prices, however, once i tried the product, i was more than happy to pay top dollar for these products!"
4.00,"It really made my teeth feel cleaner! Felt refreshing as well"
3.00,"Floruride? Years ago I lived in Britain and they put Floruride in both the mainstream toothpaste and also the water. It's a tough call if this is acceptable. Personally I'd rather not brush with Floruride however it is proven to help gum desease. After living in the USA for 16 I found it an unpleasant experience to use Floruride again"
5.00,"Teeth feel super clean, our new favorite toothpaste!"
5.00,"Got this as part of my oral care for my teeth. At 50 my teeth have some sensitive areas, and this was recommended by dentist. Works well, and along with flossing and complete care mouth wash by Crest, seems to be doing an excellent job!"
4.00,"this toothpast does the job. It freshens breathe and make my teeth feels clean."
5.00,"I love this kit! Everything goes together and lasts the same amount of time, so when you run out you get a whole new kit and start over. Easy as can be. My mouth has never been fresher and I feel good knowing I am using pro-health products that continue working even after I am done brushing, flossing and rinsing. The brush feels great, like a massage. The mouthwash is pleasant without a lot of \"bite\" to it, it left my mouth feeling fresh for a long time. The floss is the nicest floss I have ever used. It really does glide and it tastes great too. Excellent kit."
1.00,"Poor cap design, toothpaste leaves a film in your mouth and product did not improve semi-annual cleanings."
4.00,"...but as others have said, nothing really special. It worked as intended, and my mouth definitely felt fresh and clean, but in my opinion it didn't really work any better than other (cheaper) mouth rinses. Still a great product, though, and certainly does its job."
4.00,"The Pro-Health mouthwash is less of an 'all purpose' product and claims to be formulated to fight plaque and gingivitis. I can't say that I have any of these but the active ingredient, cetylpyridinium chloride \"is an antiseptic that kills bacteria and other microorganisms [and ...] has been shown to be effective in preventing dental plaque and reducing gingivitis\".The label lists six various 'benefits' including a couple of largely meaningless ones such as 'keeps teeth cleaner longer' (cleaner than what? longer than what?) or 'no burn of alcohol' but, yeah, I don't mind 'no alcohol' in a mouth wash. There is no aftertaste and you do get a 'fresh' sensation after rinsing and I believe that my teeth were clean because I brushed them not because I rinsed with Pro-Health but... it's not a bad product. Four stars are well deserved but be aware that this is not an anti-cavity mouth wash, it's an anti-plaque and anti-gingivitis."
4.00,"Would recommend this product to others."
5.00,"I got to try this toothpaste. I really liked it! My teeth and mouth felt cleaner after I used it. I did not have a problem with any sensitivity after using the paste. The flavor of the toothpaste was pleasant. I would recommend this product to my friends and family!"
4.00,"my girls love character toothpastes, cuz they come in cool flavors; the bright vivid colors are great, and the tube lasts a long time;"
4.00,"It does all the same great things as other leading brands without the burn."
5.00,"This toothpaste is great! I love how it makes my teeth feel after using it and knowing that it is working to keep my teeth clean all day. It's a great product."
1.00,"My husband and myself have both tried the Crest Pro Health. It might be good but to be absolutely honest, we can't get by the taste of the product. Maybe if you put more taste like the regular Crest toothpaste, it would taste better and maybe more people would buy it. We wound up throwing it away. Sorry. I wasn't going to say anything, but decided I needed to."
4.00,"I've been using this product for about 2 years. Previous purchased have been from retail drug stores or big box stores. Since Amazon offers it for sale, I can include it with other items as needed. It's a good product."
1.00,"I bought this mouthwash about 2 weeks ago. I felt a strange tingling on my tongue right away, but figured it was doing it's job. This past week I have not been able to taste food from the middle of my tongue to the tip.. Just on the back of my tongue. I Googled my problem and came across a few helpful articles with similar stories. Luckily I haven't experienced the brown stains on my teeth like a lot of people, but losing my sens of taste is bad enough. I highly recommend NOT buying this product, and on the verge of swearing off Crest products altogether for their lack of concern for the \"3 percent\" of people this will happen to, to put a warning on their product for fear of not making money. If I could I would give this ZERO stars. BUYER BEWARE."
4.00,"Liked this product. I have dentures, so it was a relief to find something that didn't sting and burn when used."
5.00,"I really enjoyed using this product, I am not kidding when I say it left my teeth squeaky clean. It also left my breath smelling great! I would recommend this product to my friends and families. Thank you Vocalpoint!"
1.00,"Maybe not all but the unlucky consumers, like me, may find horrible browns spots on their teeth after using this product. Just ask my dental hygienist who spent over 2 hours cleaning these stains from my teeth. BTW the hygienist also informed me of other patients, using this product, had similar stains. Good luck. Maybe you'll have no problems but you've been warned about this unbelievable product, shame on Proctor & Gamble."
4.00,"I enjoyed brushing my teeth with this toothpaste. It made my mouth feel minty fresh and very clean."
5.00,"Really impressed by this toothpaste. Leaves my mouth feeling thoroughly clean."
5.00,"This mouthwah was new to me and I didn't know what to expect. I was very pleasantly surprised by the taste and the wonderful fresh feeling it left in my mouth."
5.00,"My teeth feel great after using the Pro Health toothpaste. The taste wasn't the greatest though."
4.00,"Great product I have recommended this to my family."
5.00,"I love all crest products. I have been using the Crest Pro Health Plaque Control. I just had a dental cleaning last week. I was in and out in no time. My dentist said my teeth and gums were in the best shape ever! I love this product and will continue using it."
5.00,"This is a great toothpast,has a minty cool taste and feels like it's heating up as you first begin to use it. Makes you feel it's doing it's job and I believe it is. Get a good night's rest with fresh breath,by using Crest Pro Health!"
4.00,"I like the Crest pro health clinical plaque control toothpaste very much. The toothpaste dont just remove plaque, it helps to keep it from coming back."
5.00,"Crest Pro Health Toothpaste makes you feel like you just left the dentist's office."
4.00,"This product received high marks from all members of my family, Ages 15 to 46. We appreciated that is alcohol free, who needs alcohol in their mouthwash anyway? Everyone liked the long lasting freshness. Eight thumbs up from our family. We will purchase again and recommend it to other."
1.00,"I just bought this yesterday and tried it last night. I noticed that it though it was alcohol free it seemed to be burning my tongue quite a bit. I went to bed and tried it again this morning. Same thing and after eating I had a lot of trouble tasting my food. :( I came on here wondering if anyone had the same problems and sure enough. Too bad. Next time I'll stick to the regular stuff."
5.00,"I love this stuff. It makes my mouth feel so clean. I think people who have not tried it should. You would not be sorry."
4.00,"I used the Crest mouthwash- I thought it did a good job- but I disliked the strong peroxide taste of the product."
5.00,"Crest offers the best line of toothpaste products to help maintain your teeth, esp. if you're looking to maintain that \"after-the-dentist\" clean feeling!"
3.00,"It works. Just like any other toothpaste. There wasn't anything that made me especially like or dislike it compared to my regular toothpaste."
3.00,"This is a weird and picky thing, but this toothpaste doesn't \"foam\" the way my usual toothpaste does. It was strange. I actually didn't really care for it. The flavor was ok, but I prefer a really strong minty flavor and this was very mild. If you have a low tolerance for strong mint, this would be good for you. As for the \"50+\" label, I am not sure what this does any better than your standard \"50-\" toothpaste, but it is certainly good for sensitive teeth. My teeth did feel particularly clean, though, which is always a plus! I also can't really say if there were any long term effects at this point..."
3.00,"While the product does a good job cleaning my teeth, I just don't like the slimy film that develops in my mouth after using it. I wake up in the morning with white slime in my mouth when I use this toothpaste."
1.00,"Crest makes almost all of their toothpaste products in China today. Check the labels! Nowhere is the country of origin shown on any of their dental products. All the state is Distributed by Proctor and Gamble. Enjoy!!!"
4.00,"My husband likes this kind more than I did. I am a big fan of the Crest 3D white. It really works. The Complete tasted a bit odd to me."
4.00,"This is a good mouthwash to use after brushing your teeth before bedtime. I would not recommend using it during the day, especially around anytime you are going to eat; because it will make the food taste weird."
5.00,"I am a big fan of the resealable packaging of the tampon--made for easy, mess free disposal."
5.00,"Crest pro health clinical plaque control toothpaste has made my teeth look better,and feel better.I like the way my teeth look,and feel after brushing them."
4.00,"I am usually a Crest Pro-Health girl as it is; it was nice for a little change. We just had the family trip to the dentist on monday and tried the new paste once we got home. It has the same great clean feeling; and good taste as well\" My husband even made mention of how well he liked the taste and feeling it left in his mouth\" A Rare observance!"
5.00,"This is the only mouthwash I will ever use. I could never use other mouthwashes because the of the burn from the alcohol."
5.00,"This product really made my mouth feel clean and fresh!"
5.00,"I purchased the clinical crest mmouthwash and was amazed after 2 weeks the difference....whiter,cleaner and fresher breath...certainly recommend and will continue to use...thanks!!"
5.00,"I just started using it and so far I love it. My teeth feel \"dentist\" clean. I've already recommended it to friends!"
5.00,"I don't know what it is about this toothpaste, but it just feels good to brush with it. It's not too strong of a minty flavor and does its job well. The tube is standard, but the cap is snap on and I've only had a problem once with it coming undone in my bag during travels. (Though it is over the 3oz limit for TSA airline traveling, so get the travel size for that)."
5.00,"I loved this product. I saw a different with whitening, felt a better clean, and the product has a nice taste."
4.00,"ProHealth toothpaste makes your mouth feel clean & lively. The shine on your teeth confers confidence. If your teeth are stained, try it & you will be amazed at the difference it makes."
4.00,"Miss the zing of the alcohol which makes the mouth feel fresher."
5.00,"I loved this product. This didn't have a bad tated and it was refreshing."
4.00,"I like that this toothpaste gave me a good clean feeling, just like a visit to the Dentist for a teeth cleaning, so now at home I can get similar results!"
5.00,"It felt very fresh! My teeth looks cleaner and feel great."
4.00,"i feel like it worked great, but did not care for the taste that much."
4.00,"Loved the taste and the clean feel of my teeth after using it!"
4.00,"I was not as thrilled with this toothpaste as I felt it still left a residue on my teeth. I did not always have that fresh and clean feeling. I would definitely use if I was out of my favorite though. Thanks"
4.00,"Very fresh taste. Left my mouth feeling clean and my teeth smooth. I would buy this again."
1.00,"will never buy again. left terrible aftertaste and film on my tongue, gross"
3.00,"I thought it was ok, just not great. Thanks for giving me the opportunity to try it though."
5.00,"This really gives you that just left the dentist office clean teeth feel. It taste great and everybody likes it."
1.00,"The first time I tried this mouthwash I had hard time breathing. I quickly spit it out but still couldn't breath I was gasping for air. Something like this has NEVER happen to me I'm not allergic to anything but I felt like someone who was allergic to peanut and ate it. I threw it away don't want to try it again bkuz since I couldnt breath I wont be able to call for help. I did a little exploring and found a lot of complaint for the Crest Pro Health Products"
5.00,"I purchased the Cinnamon flavor I love it. Also when I brushed my teeth It feel like I was polishing them My teeth were smooth and shiny and felt so clean."
4.00,"My family loved the mouthwash & toothpaste ...very clean feeling ..we will be buying it again Thank you :)"
4.00,"Really like the Pro Health. Teeth do feel dentist clean! Taste is the only thing I am not crazy about."
4.00,"Overall, I really like the Crest ProHealth Clean Mint Toothpaste. It has a fresh flavor that isn't overwhelming. There seem to be little gritty things (maybe baking soda) in it which helps serve as an abrasive to more thoroughly cle an my teeth. And I notice that my mouth feels cleaner longer after using it than with the cheap Colgate that I've been using. I think Crest ProHealth won me over with this toothpaste. My only complaint is that it is a bit watery or runny compared to toothpastes that I'm used to, so that if the lid isn't snapped completely in place, by the morning a bunch of the toothpaste has leaked onto the counter. I just need to be more careful."
5.00,"My husband loves Crest, so I was happy to try out this variety. I am not a big fan of Crest's taste, but I appreciate the clean feeling that lasts and lasts."
5.00,"GREAT.looked better than on line.and was shipped ,I love it love it ,love it,,,,,,,, good quality nice design ,,,,I would recomend it to every one,,"
4.00,"Crest ProHealth Clinical Rinnse leaves a funny taste in your mouth, but it is made without parabens, unlike the ProHealth mouthwashes. I like its list of accomplishments (helps reverse gingivitis! helps prevent regrowth of plaque!) and do recommend it. Funny taste is not a problem."
4.00,"The mouth wash gets rid of the germs that causes bad breath. Only downside is I really didn't like the taste...but it's a mouth wash and I have yet to find one that I like the taste too. lol"
4.00,"It's aimed at fighting plaque and gingivitis, and I can't say I've noticed anything really unique or superior about this brand than other toothpastes I've tried. But it does taste minty and leaves my mouth feeling fresh."
5.00,"What a refreshing rinse. I loved the taste and the way it made my mouth feel so clean after using it."
5.00,"After using Crest, my teeth had that after-the-dentist feeling of clean.I'll be back for more ..."
4.00,"I am an avid crest user but I thought my cheaper crest with scope cleaned my teeth just as well as this did"
4.00,"I loved the \"bubbliness\" of it and how clean it made my mouth feel. Lots of germ killing action! The aftertaste was not super, not bad, but it faded away to a less than fresh taste."
4.00,"I liked the fresh mouth feeling I got from this rinse. I don't enjoy other products that contain a lot of alcohol. This has no burn but still gives you the results you want."
5.00,"I've been using Pro-Heath toothpaste for years, since soon after it came out, and I have never noticed any sort of white slime or other issue. What I did notice was that a day after I switched to it, my sensitive teeth were no longer sensitive - this after months of no results from \"sensitive-tooth\" toothpastes containing the active ingredient potassium nitrate (like Sensodyne). I've used Crest Pro-Health ever since. I've noticed no problems - no slime, no staining - just a really clean-feeling mouth. The whitening version does have a nasty aftertaste, which \"clean mint\" doesn't seem to have."
3.00,"This tooth paste made my teeth feel very clean but I didn't notice anything special when compared to the other toothpastes I've used."
5.00,"I will buy this product again. I am very pleased with it."
4.00,"It leaves your mouth feeling really clean. I would use it again."
5.00,"I have to say, I don't really like the taste of this mouthwash, but they're not exactly used for drinking. ;) I am really loving the Pro Clinical line though! It really completed the set and made my mouth feel very fresh, very clean. This is a great finishing product to the line!"
5.00,"Love the clean feeling from this toothpaste and the flavor is great too!"
3.00,"I believe in the Crest name. I know it produces good products, ones we can trust. I do use many of the products in this line. However, I was not fond of the after taste of the pro health toothpaste. The taste stayed in my mouth too long."
5.00,"GOOD PRODUCT."
5.00,"After a not so great appt at the dentist I asked what I could do to make the next visit a good one...he recommended the Pro Healthy Clinical toothpaste floss and mouthwash. I gotta say the mouthwash really is WOW! Love it and it lasts...just started using it a week or so ago and the results are good so far.......no more bleeding gums and the bonus of really fresh feeling breath for a long time is nice!!!"
4.00,"It's a really good whitening product and the taste tastes good. I used it for about two weeks and I did see an improvement. I definitely recommend this product."
4.00,"I tried the Crest Pro Health Clinical mouthwash. I believe it does everything it claims but I have to say I despise the flavor. I didn't like the way it felt in my mouth. Other than that I was pleased."
5.00,"My husband totally loves this toothpaste. It is all that he wants to use now! Makes your teeth/mouth feel clean and fresh"
1.00,"Do not use Crest Pro-Health Rinse or toothpaste! I just used the rinse and cannot taste anything. After Googling it I have found that not only does it cause taste lose while using the product but it also causes staining. I cannot believe this product is still on the market! If I don't have taste back by tonight I'm going to freak out."
5.00,"Love this product. It gives a refreshing clean feeling to my whole mouth."
5.00,"I have been very happy with this product. My teeth feel clean and refreshed and tastes great!"
1.00,"I used this product thinking it wouldl be able to remove some built up plaque I had between my front teeth, after using it for a week. The plaque build up is still visible."
5.00,"I am a bit of a toothpaste snob and was very pleased when I tried this product. The flavor is pleasant and my teeth feel very clean."
1.00,"Stained my teeth something awful. I thought it was soda, tea, coffee, etc. and tried cutting back, but it got worse. I had switched to Crest Pro Health mouthwash a few months ago and it started immediately, though I didn't put it together myself. My dental hygienist told me today what caused it and (thank goodness) took an extra 20 minutes to clean my teeth and make sure it was all taken off! Plus, it tastes bad and leaves a nasty after taste."
5.00,"I like the fact that these new Pro-Health line uses stannous flouride instead of sodium flouride. I only buy this line of toothpaste now when I used to be a regular Colgate buyer. I also like the flip top caps. I think it's convenient. I don't understand what is the problem that some people are having. You don't have to use the flip top. It's twists off like a regular cap. So what difference does it make if they put a regular twist off cap on it?"
4.00,"This is a great mouthwash and I was very pleased with the results!"
5.00,"I love Crest ProHealth. I have gingivitis and the Crest is really helping."
5.00,"Great toothpaste, feels clean and fresh after brushing"
5.00,"This is the best mouthwash I've used. My mouth feels fresh and clean."
5.00,"This is a great toothpaste. It leaves your mouth feeling clean, and your teeth feeling clean and minty fresh as well. I really liked this product."
5.00,"Left my mouth with a clean fresh feeling. Even my kids liked using."
4.00,"Teeth felt clean and mouth is fresh.I have as yet to see the whiteness part.Overall, I think it is a great product!"
5.00,"I tried this mouthwash and loved it. I got the minty clean feeling and loved how it left my mouth feeling."
5.00,"Crest Pro-Health products promise a lot in the way of tooth and gum protection, and they claim to have the clinical tests to back up their claims. I do not know, and cannot know, the validity of these claims. The list on the face of the package claims the product helps prevent cavities, gingivitis, plaque, tartar buildup, helps with sensitivity, whitens the teeth, and freshens the breath. That's quite a list. If the toothpaste did even the first two it would be an amazing product; however, I don't know anything about the testing that the claims are based on. Reading the long list of ingredients on the back I can spot nothing that seems to be useful in removing or altering the gum problems brought on by tarter or plaque. The first ingredient listed is glycerin followed by hydrated silica and then a set of incomprehensible chemicals that I have no clue about. I doubt glycerin removes tarter or plaque so one of these mysterious other chemicals must do the job. They do claim to have clinically proven the claims presented on the package, whatever \"clinically proven\" means. I have not examined their web site. What I can say is the toothpaste tastes very good and it does \"freshen\" my breath (at least according to my cupped hand test). During brushing the toothpaste is smooth and doesn't irritate my gums. Some of these \"do all\" toothpaste products, such as Colgate's offering, taste terrible. After using Colgate's Total a few times I threw the tube away. It was just awful. This toothpaste at least tastes good. Crest is made by Procter and Gamble, which is a company I trust. I have used many of their products and found them to be uniformly excellent. Thus, I think the claims are trustworthy even though I have no way of confirming them. Like all consumers I am a captive of my previous experience with the company, and since that experience has been positive I trust the claims of Procter and Gamble. So, on the taste test, plus the breath test, and my positive experience with Procter and Gamble I give the product 5 stars. AD2"
5.00,"I really like this toothpaste, and am very happy with the \"just-from-the-dentist\" feel it gives my teeth every day! I'd highly recommend this product... :)"
4.00,"It was a good toothpaste, left my teeth feeling clean and my breath fresh"
5.00,"I used the Glide floss, Oral-B toothbrush, and Crest Plaque Control toothpaste. My teeth felt like they do when I leave the dentists office - I couldn't feel or plaque anywhere. My mouth still felt fresh this morning."
5.00,"Left my teeth feeling clean and smooth. Love the fresh clean feeling afterwards."
5.00,"This is the only toothpaste I will use. I enjoy the way it leaves my mouth, and I will definitely buy it again."
5.00,"Nothing not to like. Most importantly, my teeth felt clean and my mouth was refreshed. The clean feeling lasted all day!"
5.00,"Just like all Crest products I use I was not disappointed. Once again Crest lives up to it reputation."
5.00,"I loved this product. My teeth felt super clean and my mouth and breath felt fresh and clean."
5.00,"Works great and have since bought another tube; seems to clean really well and clean feeling lasts pretty long"
5.00,"This product made my teeth feel so fresh and clean for much longer than many other products like it. I highly recommend it!"
4.00,"These products work great. I recommend you try them out and see for yourself."
5.00,"This product truly delivers. It cleans your teeth and keeps the plaque from returning giving you that dentist feel longer. Another bonus is it's great for your gums! Love Crest Clinical products! They are the only thing I'll use."
4.00,"it needs more bubbly but overall it feels fresh after brushing my teeth."
4.00,"I already have been using Crest Pro Health Multipurpose mouthwash so this was similar to me. Most mouthwashes are very irritating to me but this one is bearable and the flavor is pretty good as far as mouthwashes go. It doesn't taste medicinal like others."
5.00,"I really enjoy using the Crest Pro Health Mouthwash. It leaves my mouth feeling so refreshed and clean. I like that it is alcohol free. It doesn't burn so I rinse a lot longer. It's a great product."
5.00,"It works great! Great taste and made my teeth feel clean."
5.00,"I have used Crest products for as long as I can remember and the Crest ProHealth toothpaster lives up to the image of great oral health care products. Crest ProHealth toothpaste is what we need in between dental visits."
4.00,"My mouth felt minty fresh after the first use. I have gingivitis so I must use a paste for sensitive teeth. I also wanted a paste for whitening however. This toothpaste has both, which is great!"
5.00,"great toothpaste!! made my teeth feel squeaky clean and fresh. taste great too."
5.00,"Teeth felt clean and fresh:) Sometimes it is hard to find a great tasting toothpaste that also makes your teeth feel clean. This has both!"
5.00,"My daughter loves how the toothpaste makes her teeth feel smooth and her breath fresh! Definitely will purchase again!"
5.00,"I love the taste and benefits this toothpaste brings! Helps me in my busy life with my oral health Thank you!!!"
5.00,"my teeth felt that just from the dentist clean. Great!!"
4.00,"I really love how fresh it makes my mouth feel, and my teeth feel so clean after I use this toothpaste."
5.00,"I have to use toothpaste for sensitive teeth. Crest Pro-Health is great because it also helps plaque build teeth. My teeth felt so smooth & clean after using it and my teeth did not hurt at all. I will continue to use this product."
4.00,"I love the taste of the mint. My gums do feel fuller and I did experience a smoother feel on my teeth."
4.00,"I'm enjoying this product. My mouth feels fresh and clean!."
2.00,"What I didn't like about this product was the after taste that it would leave in my mouth. It has a more medicine taste whenever you finished brushing. Other toothpaste of Crest never left that taste in my mouth. I was sadly disappointed in the particular type."
4.00,"Most mouthwashes burn my sensitive teeth and gums but this barely does. I like it for my nightguard to keep it fresh."
5.00,"This Product made my mouth feel deep-down refreshingly clean. I recommend rinsing with this mouthwash to everybody that would enjoy a nice clean mouth that lasts beyond just brushing."
5.00,"I purchased this mouthwash for my husband who has dry mouth among other oral problems. He is very picky about what he uses. He tried it and had me buy more. Great job CREST!!!"
5.00,"Love the fresh clean feeling this product gives me! Makes me look forward to brushing!"
1.00,"Initially I loved this stuff. My teeth felt clean and I didn't get the staining. BUT...aside from the fact that it kills an entire layer of skin cells inside your mouth every time you use it, and that the FDA seems to let a lot of bad stuff slip into the retail market, and that we have no idea just how much 'bad stuff' is being absorbed through your oral mucus membranes into your system every time you use this stuff...after a while you completely loose your sense of taste! That's great for dieting, I admit, AND I want my teeth until I'm 100, but there has to be a better way! The loss of taste is a well known side-effect of the Pro-Health Mouthwash!"
5.00,"I used to only use Crest toothpaste, but for some reason over the past few years started migrating to others. This reminded me of how much I liked Crest and want to regularly use it again."
2.00,"Tried this toothpaste for around two weeks. I really like Crest, but this toothpaste did not reduce my sensitivity at all. I ended up moving on to Aquafresh which really works for me. Based on the other reviews, this obviously works for other people, just not me."
4.00,"I have had problems with cavities in the past and this seems to have helped with my recent check ups! My mouth feels clean for a good part of the morning after brushing and I don't have any extra sensitivity."
5.00,"My teeth felt clean all day long! Great product, would buy again."
5.00,"The mouth wash worked great. Kept me feeling fresh and clean! I would recommend it to my friends and family."
1.00,"I hate this mouthwash. I want a healthier mouth but apparently, Crest thinks the only way to deliver that is by destroying your taste buds so everything tastes like iodized metal. This is seriously disgusting. Please don't waste your money thinking the nay sayers are liars. We're not."
5.00,"This is the exact brand my dentist recommends for my sensitive teeth, and I have used this for a few years now with great results. My wife starting complaining about sensitive teeth, so she tried this and is sold on being a great sensitive toothpaste. Purchasing these on Amazon is cheaper than in the stores in my area."
5.00,"You would think a manufacturer would poll customers before just stopping a product production if there is nothing wrong with it. These guys \"thought\" they were perceived as \"scamming\"? I think they just reduced product production overall and this one \"took the hit\". Bad Judgement"
5.00,"I have tried many mouthwashes and I really did love this one. It was not too strong, even the kids liked it. And I loved the fresh clean feeling. I will definitely be buying this again."
1.00,"I really wish I had researched this product before I used it, but who creates a mouthwash that will stain your teeth? I am a coffee drinker who has never had a problem with staining, but this product definitely caused me some embarrassment. Use hydrogen peroxide to rinse if you are afraid of getting oral cancer."
4.00,"I liked how it left your mouth feeling clean and minty."
1.00,"This product gave me very dark brown stains that gradually snuck up on me, in between my teeth, by the time the first bottle was gone. I can't get them off! Do not use this product! We brush and especially floss religiously every single day, we even use two mouthwashes afterwards as part of our normal routine. For all our effort and investment, we did not expect to be INFLICTING ourselves with dark brown stains! I guess this must come as a shock to crest, but we actually were using their product to CLEAN our teeth. I thought that was common sense, but apparently common sense is not so common these days especially when corporate profits are involved apparently! I have tried using a scaler, hydrogen peroxide, brushing hard (bad for gums and teeth!) and will turn to my dentist for my next attempt. The stains appeared after about a month of usage, and since at the same time I had been eating a bit of dates and black inky colored rice I assumed it might have been from them. After several more weeks had passed of avoiding dark foods the stains intensified enough to make me investigate the mouthwash since it was the only new part of our routine. Sure enough on the back of the label it warns that it might stain teeth, and that proper brushing prevents it. Well, we brush VERY properly and floss religiously every single day, and yet still got terrible staining! This is ridiculous, that a product that is marketed to help avoid stains and clean the teeth would cause it to look diseased, like I use tobacco! I am absolutely angry about this and just took back our third and forth bottles to the store we purchased them from for a full refund. I am going to be looking to join a class action suit the first chance I get and will update this review with a link when I find one. Obviously, I am not alone. Shame on Crest. I will never use another of their products for my teeth or my family's dental care. Absolute shame on them! UPDATE: I just went to a lawyers and settlements website and requested a case review. If anyone out there wants to join I suggest you do the same! I know I cannot post the link here, but if you contact me in the comments section I will get you the link or somehow help organize."
5.00,"Fabulous toothpaste! My teeth feel so CLEAN! I love it!"
4.00,"I've always been a Crest toothpaste user. The new Pro-Health line is remarkable. Had no clue until I began using the Pro-Health what truly clean teeth felt like. Of course, the hygienist could get them super clean. With the new Pro-Health Clinical Crest, I have the power to clean like the hygienist!"
5.00,"This is my daughter's favorite toothpaste and it has been discontinued in all stores by us. She was happy I found it on Amazon. Only concern with Crest Pro-health are the number of complaints that the mouth was leaves brown stains over time...I worry that the toothpaste may do the same thing."
4.00,"I liked it and felt like it worked well. My teeth still felt clean for a long time after brushing."
5.00,"I really like this toothpaste. It makes my teeth, mouth and gums feel clean and fresh. I've used various Crest products for years and years but this one if my favorite."
4.00,"This Crest toothpaste left my mouth feeling pleasantly fresh and clean. I would try it again in the future."
3.00,"It kept my teeth feeling clean and fresh all day! I would recommend this to anyone who wants to have the feeling of how fresh your mouth stays while you are chewing gum."
5.00,"I loved the Crest Pro-Health line before, but the Clinical products are really a notch above. This toothpaste makes my mouth feel incredibly clean! It's very minty without tasting like antiseptic. It may cost a little more, but not much, and it is totally worth it."
4.00,"It would be nice if the cap is childproof, love the fresh taste but too much foam. But overall, I would recommend this product!"
4.00,"This toothpaste worked just like I expected it to, but with my sensitive teeth, I'll be sticking to my usual sensitive toothpaste."
4.00,"If you only rinse for the 30 seconds the bottle says to, your tongue and mouth won't be burned. I made this mistake once, and after I realized what the problem was, it didn't happen again. I only use this at night as it does seem to affect the way food tastes when used in the morning. I'm on my second bottle, and my teeth feel so clean. Not sure why there are so many negative reviews. Also, the bottle says this may cause stains on your teeth, but that's only because of inadequate brushing, they say it's not permanent."
5.00,"I recently had to have some dental work done due to issues with plaque and gum disease. I switched to the Crest Clinical after my visit. At my four week checkup my dentist couldn't believe how good everything looked! He says keep up the good work!"
5.00,"The pro-health toothpaste made your teeth feel real clean like you had just finished getting them cleaned at the dentist."
4.00,"The rinse was good - not as harsh as other competitor brands. It does leave your mouth feeling clean. I personally do not use rinses as often as I do a flouride mouthwash."
5.00,"Left my mouth fresh and did not havea strong minty taste. Also had no after sting. But on the downside was a little pricey"
3.00,"It doesn't seem to work as well as the one I bought in the store....it does work well though. It was worth it..."
4.00,"Some rinses have a burning or very intense taste, but this rinse is very mild and different from the rest! It's a great product."
4.00,"I have been looking for a great mouthwash for a while and this one was perfect. The flavor was great and not hot like mouthwash can be."
4.00,"This toothpaste makes my mouth feel so clean!!! I love the way it makes it feel!"
5.00,"I like this product because it makes my mouth really clean! I definitely plan on buying it again!"
5.00,"This toothpaste has the same texture and taste as the cleaning solution they use at the dentist. Makes me feel like my teeth are getting the best clean they can without making a trip to the dentist."
4.00,"I thought this was a really good toothpaste. I usually use another brand, but I enjoyed using this for a change. I liked it a lot."
5.00,"hi i would like to share this review of the crest pro-health toothpaste.I would definetely recommend it because unlike other toothpaste this one leaves youre mouth feeling fresh and clean.Also another thing it does not leave that ugly after taste."
1.00,"I thought I was getting normal sized tubes, over $2 a piece for sample sizes, this is ridiculous!!! dont buy"
5.00,"Left my mouth feeling refreshed and my teeth feeling clean."
4.00,"It did a great job of removing the plaque but I didn't like the taste and it didn't leave my mouth feeling as clean as my normal mouthwash but it is still a good mouthwash to use at a great value."
5.00,"Teeth feel very clean and mouth tastes fresh. I like how long the fresh taste lasted. The clean mint flavor is very appealing. I feel like I have done something good for my mouth."
4.00,"I did like this product, the taste, texture etc. However I did not find it to be particular superior over many other brands of toothpaste. I would buy it again though."
4.00,"i am definietly switching... these are high quality.. i find the toothpaste an dmouthwash to really leave me feeling clean.. as if i had a dentist cleaning.. if i can get these at a decent price..i will def buy.. the tootbrush was fine.. nothing extremely special.. i use eletric anyway.. but it was great for what it was.. try these products.. especially toothpaste.. great taste and doest great job!"
3.00,"I found it left my teeth feeling clean but as far as breath freshening I have tried better. I didn't find that it did anything that any other tooth paste hasn't done with brushing regular and correctly though."
5.00,"This mouthwash works great all day. This is a new staple in our house."
5.00,"Crest Pro-Health Toothpaste does a thorough cleaning of your teeth. It leaves your mouth feeling fresh as well.Your teeth feel smooth and look bright. It does such a good job, you will feel like you've been to the dentist.It is a good product to use between checkups at your dentist's office."
4.00,"It is a disappointment not to have fresh feeling in mouth after brushing even though my teeth feel a lot cleaner and the clean feeling on my teeth last longer than with other toothpaste."
4.00,"This actually has a pleasant taste and doesn't sting when used for strength."
5.00,"The toothpaste left my teeth feeling bright and shiny and clean. But for me personally, I didn't care for the flavor or the aftertaste it left in my mouth. This is a great product and I would recommend it to others."
5.00,"i loved how it made my mouth feel so clean and it didnt taste as bad as others i have tried."
5.00,"I will try this product again. It always helps to have quality product you can rely on, Thanks."
3.00,"The new crest mouth wash does a great job at cleaning and whitening your teeth. The only problem I have had with this product is the mouth wash does not freshen my breath like the other product I was previously using."
5.00,"The Pro-Health Night is wonderful! My teeth feels so clean afterwards!"
5.00,"It's so nice to find a mouthwash that doesn't set your mouth on fire!! It's even better when you find one that makes your mouth FEEL clean too! Crest Pro Health mouthwash does just that! Yay to Crest for making such great products!"
5.00,"I loved the fact that the taste was not overwelming but was able to provide a long lasting freshness for my mouth."
5.00,"I rather for you buy from drugstore, walmart, or something that way you know expiration date and sealed. It will be safer than here. Anyway I will compare all mouthwash and toothpaste I had used in past                                                                     I used Sensodny toothpaste because i watched on tv where dentist saying it is best for senstive tooth. It helped stopping hurt tooth when you bite apple or ice cream . It restored and make nervous stronger.                                                                     It was worst! I think my nervous got weaker and hurt bad, it looked kinda blue. I hurried using all then I stopped when it got to middle halfway.                                                                     NEVER BELIEVE NOTHING!                                                                     Regular Crest is great but AIM is alright for a regular toothpaste , I would say same in some way because it has flouride. Just use anything that is flouride and dont follow media .                                                                     CREST PRO HEALTH toothpaste is the BEST for following up with DENTIST checkup                                                                     I used to do Burt Bee , other organic toothpaste unbrand name, or TOM's but my tooth got worst because dentist said it must have FDA and FLOURIDE (two thing is a must). Flouride is important of all. TOM's does have flouride still I was afraid go back because they are reason I got 10 tooth pulled. If you heard abt flouride and why I didn't use it---it was in organic book saying it can be dangerous for baby if they swallow it. It is like gas. That is why we are asked to wait for 30 mins after garbled from ACT mouthwash alchol or free. IT is flourine based.                                                                     Mouthwash:                                                                     ACT-winner (use alcohol free because alcohol can fade away easily or burn heart, it did to me)                                              I am 30 age and I used Child Crest Anti Cavity Flouride (just to test and see if it better than Crest or AcT?)                                              I would say CREST PRO HEALTH and ACT is best, CHILD CREST is only level under CREST PRO. It is something I would buy in bargain.                                                                     Crest PRO HEALTH and ACT is same!                                                                     BIOTENE- I am not sure . I only used it a long time ago like when I was teen but i would not reccomde it if you need serious teeth care.                                                                     YOU can use peppermint and tree tea as mouthwash but it doesnt have flourine. It will help reduce some bacteria.                                                                     TAP from sink water has flourine of 100% so drink it!                                                                     NOTE: you still need some bacterias to help fight givity, cavity, etc."
1.00,"There is something wrong with this toothpaste. It causes your mouth to peel. A bit after you brush you notice some weird stuff in your mouth. It is your skin! Peeling from your cheeks and inner lips.I tried to look into this on the crest website but there are only glowing reviews there and it would not let me create an account so I can review this bad toothpaste."
4.00,"I loved it. It was a refreshing flavor & kept my mouth feeling minty for quite a while."
4.00,"I liked the toothpaste, great taste and left my teeth feeling and looking clean."
4.00,"I was quite pleased with the way it keeps my mouth feeling fresh."
5.00,"I love this wash. It doesn't taste mediciney and leaves my mouth feeling cleaner than it ever has. Great product!!"
5.00,"I've been using this for a while now. Really helps your teeth feel polished between cleanings!"
5.00,"This toothpaste was the best -the feel even the next morning that I had been to the dentist for a cleaning. I recommend highly."
5.00,"This product makes my teeth feel like they have a glossy shine. Highly recommended!"
5.00,"I love this stuff. It does a great job and the flip top cap is awesome."
5.00,"Great floss, good value. I always buy glide floss, and will definately be buying this again!"
4.00,"It made my mouth feel fresh & clean! Nice product for sure."
3.00,"I've used just about any and every kind of toothpaste (I'm pretty indiscriminate about the brands I buy) and this Crest Pro-Health seems about average. After using it for several weeks, I haven't had any problems previous reviewers have reported. I've not had any burning, soreness, or staining in my mouth or teeth. The whitening is pretty non-existent though. I didn't see a difference at all. As for the other benefits, just about every toothpaste claims to fight gingivitis, cavities, plaque, and tooth sensitivity so I'm not sure Crest does it any better than any other brand or toothpaste. There is a nice mint taste to the toothpaste but this dissipates pretty quickly and is not what I'd call a breath freshener per se. On the whole I think this is a pretty average toothpaste but nothing special and not a great whitener."
5.00,"Love Crest Complete toothpaste. I would highly recommend. Makes teeth feel clean even hours after brushing."
5.00,"I really like this toothpaste. It works wonderfully and really cleans my teeth. A+"
5.00,"I like the clean feeling it left in my mouth that lasted a long time."
5.00,"very refreshing and long-lasting. Would recommend to anyone."
5.00,"My teeth feel clean and fresh. It also leaves a mint breath to my mouth!"
5.00,"Our children especially love this product. Great flavor and the cartoon characters are a real hit. Well done to Crest."
4.00,"Love the clean, smooth feeling left by this toothpaste. Crest has a great product here."
5.00,"Cleans your teeth very well, gets into hard to clean places. Leaves your mouth feeling clean for a long time."
5.00,"The Crest Pro-Health toothpaste makes my mouth feel really clean."
5.00,"I have always loved crest products!! This product did not let me down!! Love the refreshing feeling!!!"
4.00,"Tastes pretty good and seems to get nice results..Quite expensive compared to other brands but you get what you pay for in this instance."
5.00,"Crest has come a long way. I was always a Colgate fan, however, two years ago I started trying out Crest's Pro Health products (mainly because of a CVS promotion). I am honestly impressed by the quality of the toothpaste. My teeth feel clean without any residue. The mint is crisp without being overpowering or any yucky aftertaste. It is a bit pricier, but I consider it an investment. I combine this toothpaste with the Crest Pro Health for night time brushes and am going two years cavity free."
1.00,"It made my lower set of teeth brown as crap. Why is this still on the market after so long?"
1.00,"I hated this stuff. It made my mouth foam up like a crazy Possum. The after taste was awful. It was almost as if I gargled pure poroxcide. I prefer Crest Pro-Health, no Clinical for me. My hubby liked it tho. I'll not buy it for me. Maybe for him."
4.00,"It tastes good, feels minty in my mouth. My last visit to the dentist was very positive. No cavities."
4.00,"I liked this toothpaste. It had a nice taste and kept my mouth feeling clean."
4.00,"This really does glide through your teeth easily. Has good flavor. I liked it!"
5.00,"I Love how clean my mouth felt after rinsing. Did not have bad breath all day."
5.00,"One of the highest quality oral product I have tried."
4.00,"I like how clean my mouth felt after I used the toothpaste, but it left an aftertaste. It is fine if you are using it before bed, but if you use it in the morning before breakfast you will want to wait a while before eating anything."
5.00,"Leaves your teeth clean and your mouth fresh for a long time!"
5.00,"It was worth every penny. Left my mouth feeling SUPER clean!"
5.00,"The mouth is full of bacteria (hundreds of species were found in a recent study of the salivary microbiome) so the Cetylpyridinium Chloride anti-microbial in this mouthwash is the primary reason I bought it. Having gone through two 1.5 litre bottles I have been very happy indeed both with the taste and efficacy of this mouthwash.I use it in conjunction with a professional ultrasonic toothbrush."
5.00,"Love the product! great taste. great plaque remover!"
5.00,"The new Crest oral rinse is great. My mouth stays fresh and clean feeling for hours. I highly recommend this product."
4.00,"I like this toothpaste because after using it for a couple of weeks, it helped to remove plaque from my teeth. The only thing I didn't like was the after effect it left. It was similar to using toothpaste mixed with baking soda. That would be the only thing that would bring a downfall but over all great!"
4.00,"Does not take as much as you think you will need, a little goes a long way!! Great product!"
4.00,"This toothpaste didn't wow me, but I did like it. I enjoyed the flavor and my teeth felt clean for awhile after brushing."
5.00,"Highly recommend!"
5.00,"The toothpaste does a great job keeping my mouth feeling clen and fresh all day!"
3.00,"I did not like the taste very much. If you can overlook that the product did leave my mouth clean and breath fresh."
4.00,"it was very effective and it loks gross but doesnt taste gross or have a bad after taste it was pleasant and i didnt ruin it for me hours after i used it . i saw a noticable difference it was very easy to use"
4.00,"I'm love when my mouth feels fresh and clean. This product did a great job at both getting my mouth clean and helping it stay clean."
5.00,"Might be a little pricey on the shelf, but not having to \"feel the burn\" of mouthwash AND getting a great taste are completely worth it! Crest has hit a home run yet again!"
5.00,"I love Crest toothpaste!!! This is another great product from Proctor & Gamble!!!"
5.00,"I absolutely love this toothpaste. I don't know what the little scrubby things in the toothpaste are but they sure clean my teeth well."
5.00,"Very pleasant taste & I loved the results, freshens breath for a much longer taime than my usual brand, I will purchase this product again"
1.00,"Just wanted to warn others NOT to try this product! I bought this at a drug store 2 days ago because I thought it would be a good way to keep my teeth/gums healthy and have good breath as well. The Crest rinse sounded so good--no burning alcohol, and many other \"positive\" things about it...Was I wrong!!! Right away I noticed my mouth tasting strange and I couldn't really taste well. I thought maybe I had burned my tongue and thus impaired my tastebuds and even mentioned it to my husband. The next day it continued. He too, had the same issue with lack of taste. We then figured it HAD to be the Crest mouthwash. So I looked up reviews of it and saw complaint after complaint about the same thing!! I still have lack of taste and a hard to explain \"numb/tingly\" type sensation on my tongue. Thankfully no brown spots like others reported since we only used it 3 or 4 times.. Really can't believe they would sell such a product.. don't buy it!"
4.00,"My teeth and gumline have never felt cleaner!!!!!!"
4.00,"This product does a great job of making your teeth feel really clean. Not to mention, kids can use it and the taste doesn't bother them!"
5.00,"i love the idea of alcohol free mouth washes. The original taste took some getting use to - i guess because it doesn't have the alcohol like most. But once i adapted to the taste i prefer it. Not so harsh and very refreshing."
5.00,"I am not usually a brand-specific buyer. Toothpaste is one of those things that I will buy whatever I can get a good deal on. But last week I got a good deal on the Crest pro-clinical Plaque Control toothpaste. The shelf cost is higher than I would usually pay, but after the first time I used it...wow! It reminded me of the feeling I got when I left the dentist after a cleaning. I'm not sure what makes the difference, but I encourage you to give it a try....it is so worth it!"
5.00,"The top pick for mouth wash"
4.00,"Works great to keep teeth feeling clean and breath fresh. My only worry is that it is SO strong it might be too harsh, which over time can cause issues with sensitivity in my family. But so far no problems."
5.00,"If my kids like the taste of any toothpaste it has to taste good.I like it alot also.It made my teeth feel clean for hours.I will buy it again for sure."
5.00,"I have very very sensitive teeth and this mouthwash doesn't bother my teeth at all. It is very refreshing."
4.00,"Kills all bacteria....leaves mouth fresh and clean...."
5.00,"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE makes your teeth feel so smooth and clean. And I am one that is very picky about my teeth. I would reccomend this to everyone."
1.00,"Crest is fine but don't go with this one."
5.00,"I am extremely impressed with Crest ProHealth toothpaste. I used to use a different brand of toothpaste but have found one I thoroughly enjoy. The first time I used the toothpaste I could feel the difference from my other products. I have been using Crest ProHealth toothpaste for a few days now and I can definitely see a difference. My teeth are whiter and seem to sparkle when I smile. I have a dental appointment in a month and when they ask what I have been using I can gladly say the line of ProHealth toothpaste made by Crest."
5.00,"This leaves your tooth feeling very clean and fresh breath! This is my new favorite toothpaste now."
4.00,"I love the new crest toothpastes! My teeth have never felt so clean!!"
4.00,"I think it works well but it is a little expensive. I also wish it was a little more minty flavor."
5.00,"I have been a CREST user for over 40 years. I discovered this version on vacation when I could not find what I usually use. Reading the box, I kept thinking theses claims cannot be true. After using it the first night, I could tell that my teeth and mouth felt cleaner and fresher. The amazing thing is the next morning my mouth did seem to have that nearly just brushed feeling. I have been using NIGHTTIME CREST for over two months and am still impressed with the difference ."
5.00,"I'll be back for more ..."
5.00,"I used the crest pr health clinical toothpaste, it left my teeth feeling extremly clean and my breath fresh. The toothpaste had a mild flavor not too harsh. I would recommend this to my friends."
5.00,"This product definitely is something I will continue to use for a while.I was able to see a great difference in general oral health after using this ."
1.00,"I started using this mouthwash and it felt almost like it burnt my tongue/ tastebuds. Hours later I could still feel the burning sensation. I don't understand without any alcohol. i see numerous complaints of this as well. - the purple clumps i believe maybe what it breaks up between the teeth, etc..but the burning.. uncalled for"
5.00,"Crest Pro-Health Multi-Protection is an alcohol free mouth rinse which I prefer. You don't get the burn without the alcohol and still get the health benefit of killing germs, plaque reduction, prevention of gingivitis, cleaner teeth and fresh breath. The taste of the clean mint is nice. Without the alcohol, its a nice light flavor."
5.00,"I love all the Crest clinical products! This toothpaste isn't overpoweringly like others , and it really gets my teeth clean. Paired up with Crest mouthwash, you have a dentist fresh clean you can count on. I love all Crest product."
5.00,"Crest is your \"go to\" toothpaste. It has great quality and the price is fair. I love how my teeth feel after I brush with Crest. I feel like I just got back from the dentist. I love this toothpaste!"
5.00,"I really felt that the Crest Pro Health Toothpaste did an amazing job getting my teeth clean and I had a nice smooth finish after brushing. The flavor was not overpowering and it did the job that it was promised to do. I would absolutely recommend this product to anyone who wants cleaner feeling teeth. It didn't have that chalky taste like some paste have and rinsed out clean after I was finished brushing. Crest Pro Health really delivered on this one!"
5.00,"I used the plaque control tooth paste for just 3 weeks before going to my dentist ....ladies & gentlemen this tooth paste is HEAVEN SENT !!!..IT HELPED TO CUT DOWN ON MY CLEANING TIME IN THE DENTIST CHAIR!!!! YES, I WILL CONTINUE USING THIS LINE OF PRODUCTS BY CREST...."
5.00,"Clean teeth are happy teeth and mine are very happy now!"
5.00,"Thanks for letting me try because now I have switched."
5.00,"I recently tried Crest Pro-Health toothpaste. This toothpaste gets top marks for the removal of plaque. I immediately noticed a difference."
5.00,"LOVE this mouthwash - no burn, tastes great, keeps my breath fresh! I continue to enjoy the wonderful tastes of all different kinds of meals and have no problems with my teeth turning brown, after 4 years of using this product. While I don't doubt that side effects can occur with this, it does seem that these reviews are inherently skewed - how many people would take the time to review such a mundane purchase such as mouthwash if their only thoughts on it were that they liked it?"
5.00,"The product has really improved my gum health! I appreciate that I still have a clean mouth after a good night sleep."
4.00,"Been using this new paste for a couple weeks now. My teeth feel cleaner and look better than ever!"
4.00,"Not a bad product. I do feel it makes my mouth feel fresher after using it."
4.00,"On a pure performance level, I LOVE this toothpaste. It absolutely makes my mouth feel clean and fresh. It does not foam up as much as some other toothpastes, but the effect and feel of it make this a real winner. The downside is that I think this is priced outrageously for the amount of toothpaste you receive. Is it worth that much more than a $3 tube of a different toothpaste? I can't honestly say it is. The rating gets docked for that. If you Love this, as I do, you may want to look for the 2-pack when they come out with it. Also, note that this comes in different sizes. In addition to this size, it comes in a 4.2 oz size (strangely, this is the size in the picture), as well as a 6 oz size in the Crest Pro-Health Collection Kit, which has yet to be released."
5.00,"Crest Pro-health is my new favorite toothpaste. I love the flavor, which isn't overpowering but is strong enough to last long after brushing. It makes my teeth feel squeaky clean and fresh. Thanks to this toothpaste, along with Glide Pro-health floss and Crest Pro-health mouthwash, I have maintained a cavity free mouth :)."
3.00,"Let's just start off I've only recently became an avid mouthwash user since I have a problem with bad breath. I have used Crest Mouthwash (the non-alcohol one that's purple), Listerine, SmartMouth, and Crest Clinical. All in all if you have used SmartMouth, this product is quite similar to it in terms of taste and what it does to your taste buds. And people complaining about it burning, it clearly state it contains Hydrogen Peroxide and since people reacts to it accordingly, stay clear of it. I don't feel the burning sensation luckily so this product works pretty darn well for me. As for the taste bud, the SmartMouth uses some kind of Zinc formula and that adversely affects what you'll be tasting for quite awhile. I normally just rinse my mouth after eating a meal so throughout the day, I wouldn't have to endure what you all are having to go through. The pros of this product is that it does what it claims and the next morning, I have pretty decent breath and not the decay smell of dry arid mouth. So if you have a pretty good tolerance to Hydrogen Peroxide or any alcohol in your mouth, this is THE product to use. I bought mine at the local drug store and love it thoroughly. My teeth is still white (used their whitening strips like 3-4 years ago). Been using this mouthwash for almost 3 weeks now. Haven't seen signs of my teeth turning brown as others had mentioned. And if you went to your Dentist after using this and haven't been to one within 6 months, and they claimed your teeth needs cleaning, your teeth was dirty to begin with or they're simply charging you money for a simple cleaning. Don't blame Crest for that either. I thought that was ridiculous. Overall, I would recommend this product if you're able to handle the pain (if you feel any to begin with) and if you can't, go use the non-alcohol one. Simple as that."
4.00,"The Crest Pro-Health Toothpaste has a clean, fresh taste which lasts all day! I love the way it makes my teeth feel after brushing: super clean and exciting!"
4.00,"I have been using Crest Pro-health Clinical for over a year now without loss of taste or other sensations. I selected it just because it was quite anti-bacterial with out drying alcohol. I wanted my gums to reattach to my teeth to reduce the pockets that hold food. At my last dental check up my gums did reattach about half of the deepest pocket's depth. So I researched it more and changed my procedure to get a better outcome. I'm 67 years old and want my teeth to be in better health, I don't want to need gum surgery later. The herbicide (Cetylpyridinium Chloride (0.1%)) in Crest-pro health Clinical kills all he germs in your mouth, so don't swallow it! But it also causes staining to happen. The herbicide becomes a cation missing an electron. It's used by biology majors as a prep to tissue when staining cells for microscope viewing. The cation attracts an anion of any staining substance, like the dyes in your toothpaste or the dyes in some other rinses! So I use this herbicide cation to attract fluoride ions instead (F-). First I floss very well. Then rinse my teeth with warm water from a water pick to dig out my pockets. Then I rinse with crest pro-health Clinical for 15 seconds (which has No dye and has the most concentrated germicide) Then I warm water rinse twice. Then I brush well with a toothpaste without color dyes (Sensodyne proNamel gentle whitening with Potassium Nitrate (5%) for Antihypersensitivity, and Sodium Fluoride ). I Water rinse again then rinse lightly with Biotene rinse and put in my tooth guard and go to sleep. I only use the pro-health at night to avoid attracting food stains in the day."
4.00,"I felt refreshingly clean after using the mouth wash! Would repurchase!"
4.00,"I like the clean feel of the foam as you rinse and also like that it cleans without any burning sensation!"
4.00,"I really like this toothpaste. Although I've liked the Pro-Health before. I like how clean my mouth feels. And that feeling lasts for awhile throughout the day."
5.00,"My last dental visit indicated that I was starting to get plaque buildup between my bottom teeth. Since I started using this product, I have not noticed any buildup."
5.00,"I don't usually like to use mouthwash because of the \"burning\" effect. But I like that this one does not have said effect, but still gets my mouth fresh and clean."
5.00,"This is a great little package! Unlike other \"gift\" sets that contain nonsense or junk items, Crest has actually put together an excellent collection of their best products. I prefer the Crest Pro Health mouthwash over Listerine-- big time. After using the Crest mouthwash for several months, I tried some Listerine I had left over and promptly discarded it. This stuff is MUCH more pleasant. The toothbrush and floss are also outstanding and high quality. I have noticed a marked decrease in stains/tartar buildup after using all four products in tandem. Highly Recommended!"
4.00,"The mouthwash left my mouth feeling really clean and left no bad aftertaste."
4.00,"Crest complete clinical is a great multipurpose rinse that I use twice a day to keep my mouth healthy and fresh."
5.00,"After using this toothpaste my mouth felt clean, my teeth were smooth and I couldnt stop running my tongue over them! It was amazing. I will definitely recommend this toothpaste to everyone!"
5.00,"My teeth has a Great clean feeling that left my mouth feel Great."
4.00,"Really liked the Overnight version. Kept mouth fresher overnight than regular toothpaste."
5.00,"My mouth felt clean all day...It felt like going back to the dentist. love the fresh clean feeling."
5.00,"Great product I would recommend it to all my family and friends"
5.00,"Taste in a toothpaste can be a deal breaker for me...if it is not pleasant. Who really knows how many cavaties were prevented or if gum disease was prevented due to a specific brand? But what I do know from using a toothpaste...did it taste good? Does my mouth feel and smell fresh? Did it lather/foam up to my standards? Was the tube user friendly? Would I use it again? Would I recommend it? The answer to all of those questions for this brand was YES!"
2.00,"Okay, I don't have gingivitis, but I also don't have dental insurance so can't go to the dentist regularly. I figured I'd use a tube of this toothpaste as a preventative measure, then switch back to my regular kind. I don't remember when I started using it exactly, but I'm about 1/3 or 1/2 way through the tube. At first everything was fine, but one night a week or so ago I woke up with this weird chewy/sticky texture between my teeth. I found that it appeared to be skin that had peeled either from the insides of my cheeks or my gums. It didn't happen again for a few days so I thought it was maybe a one-off occurrence, but it happened again last night. I haven't had any pain or sores, just this unpleasant shedding of the lining of my mouth. I'm not sure if I want to finish the tube or not, since I'm reading other reviews that say that they've had painful sores. I will also mention that I did get a small wound in the corner of my mouth not long after I started this toothpaste. It wasn't inside my mouth, but rather on the outside corner right where my top and bottom lip meet. I never get cold sores, it wasn't a pimple, I just opened my mouth wide to floss, and it split there and bled. I can't say for sure if it was caused by the toothpaste or not, but after reading other reviews it seems like it should be noted. I definitely won't buy this toothpaste again. If it works for you, that's great, or if it is recommended to you by a dentist. But if you don't have gingivitis, I would skip this toothpaste."
5.00,"My new favorite toothpaste! Great taste and my mouth felt clean all day!"
1.00,"I did not purchase this on Amazon and I normally don't write reviews but this is so awful that I had to. I don't understand how this stuff is legally sold in the US. I have been experiencing a metallic taste in my mouth, numbness of my tongue and a strange black spot on my tongue after just 2 days of use. This is literally poison. P&G should be ashamed for selling this and someone should check how the FDA approved this for sale to humans."
4.00,"LOVED the Crest Pro-health toothpaste. Felt super clean after brushing. Definetely felt like a higher end product and I enjoyed the chance to sample before making the buy. Hope my dentist notices a difference in plaque control when I go next."
4.00,"I have always been a fan of Crest toothpaste and was excited to try something new from them. Fortunately, they did not let me down. This toothpaste left my mouth and teeth feeling fresh and clean which is very important to me. I will continue to use Crest products for years to come, can't wait to see what's next from them."
5.00,"left my teeth feeling clean for a good period of time. Nice taste"
4.00,"Crest clinical is good. I prefer their brand of sensitive toothpaste."
4.00,"it worked very well and made my teeth feel very clean."
4.00,"I loved it - left my mouth feeling refreshed and clean."
4.00,"This a good product. Left my breath feeling fresh!"
4.00,"I love this floss, it is smooth and feels great on my sensitive gums"
2.00,"In the long battle over toothpaste supremacy Crest has always won me over. So when I saw this new product with the promise of lots of 'value' I jumped at it. After the first use and seeing the size of the tube I was greatly disappointed. The normal strong mint taste was greatly lacking and the funky color made something that isn't natural look even more unnatural. It was slimy, loose and not very pleasent in my mouth. It didn't feel very substantle and almost as if it had sat in the sun. The size of the tube itself also seemed quite smaller compared to their other tubes so I almost felt I was shorted. While I will still be a \"Crest man\" I will be choosing a different product of theirs as this one just doesn't cut it."
5.00,"I wasn't so crazy about this toothpaste. It did leave my teeth clean but I did not like the taste. Now on the other hand my husband loves this toothpaste, and it is the only toothpaste he buys and uses."
5.00,"I have always used Listerine, but hated the burn. Then I tried Listerine Zero, and it wasn't the same. The Crest is awesome- tastes great and leaves me feeling refreshed."
5.00,"Left my mouth feeling very clean. The clean feeling lasted longer than with most other toothpastes."
1.00,"Another VICTIM of Crest!  4 weeks ago my teeth were white and clean.  Bought Crest pro-health mouth wash about a month ago and now my teeth look like they are turning brown and rotting.  Don't know how they can get away selling a product like this.  I will NEVER EVER buy a Crest product again, and I will tweet and facebook about this experience so that everyone I know will never to buy Crest again."
5.00,"this toothpaste leaves your mouth feeling EXTREMELY clean and minty ! It has a pleasant flavor too!"
4.00,"I have been using Crest toothpaste, along with Sonicare toothbrushes, and the combination has left me with healthy teeth and gums into my \"golden years.\" This one seems OK, perfectly acceptable taste and texture, though I will be watching out for potential staining. The package info., while warning about possible staining, states that it is removable by a dentist. That may be reassuring, but it does seem a little ironic. When I started out using Crest there was Crest toothpaste, then gel was introduced, then tartar protection (the one I've been using for years).Today I counted twenty six different Crest formulas and flavors, about one each for every tooth I have in my head! Probably too late for me to try all of them, but I wish someone would."
5.00,"This is an amazing product. I'm very picky about toothpaste but this was perfect!I love how clean my teeth feel with this! I will definately be recommending this product to everyone I know."
1.00,"I should have read reviews before buying but like many others I bought this on sale and wanted to see if it was as good as the ads on TV say it is. It ISN\"T!! It tastes terrible, is runny and before the tube was half gone I started to lose my sense of taste.  I looked up the sympton of taste lose and it was brain tumor, infection, etc. Then I found the reviews here and stopped using the toothpaste. Now my taste is slowly returning. No brain tumor. Yea!!"
5.00,"Great product - makes my teeth feel extremely clean and I love how it has multiple benefits all in one!"
5.00,"It left my mouth fresh and clean. And will definitely buy again."
4.00,"I love how clean my mouth felt even hours after brushing."
4.00,"Only bought this because we use it for our young sons and did not have time to get to the drugstore."
4.00,"Really liked the toothpaste, good resultes after only a few uses"
5.00,"much better than colgate! i loved how my mouth felt afterwards."
5.00,"I've been using this toothpaste for several months. It's great for my sensitive gums/teeth and the flavor is good too. This is the one toothpaste for me."
5.00,"Crest pro health are great products that keep your family's dental health in great shape."
2.00,"I like to have \"fun\" toothpaste in the kitchen. Yes, I know! But sometimes I just need to brush my teeth, so I have a tooth brush in the kitchen and I like to have \"fun\" toothpaste. I thought I'd try this ... and YIKES the flavor is really not pleasant. I don't know if I would like it if I had a child's taste buds but I know I won't buy this again. I miss the vanilla expressions! I think I was the only one who bought that. thanks"
4.00,"I think part of the perks were the fact that I had been stuck on a \"reliable\" mouth rinse for years, but gave Crest a try and wow, I am a whole lot confident, and my mouth feels wonderful!"
5.00,"After using for about a week my teeth and gums feel so much cleaner"
4.00,"Love this....my mouth feels alot cleaner and fresher"
3.00,"It worked well but not sure if I would buy again because of price."
5.00,"I really liked the plaque control toothpaste. It makes my teeth feel like they were just polished at the dentist office...really clean."
5.00,"I really enjoyed the Crest Pro Samples! My teeth felt silky smooth and the mouthwash did not burn or leave an after taste. My only complaint is the cost..about 1 1/2 times more than I normally pay. On my limited, strict budget I can't afford to buy this for everyday use. However, I did find that the cost is in line with other speciality\" oral hygeine products."
5.00,"I purchased the 2-pack on sale for $3.45. This is the cool gritty taste flavor. I would purchase again but not for the same price. NOt a deal at the 2-pack $3.45 price."
4.00,"The toothpaste and mouthwash did a great job at cleaning my teeth and mouth. Left my mouth feeling refreshed and as clean as when I leave the dentist office. The price however was more than other pastes and washes. I'm not sure that I would buy this brand everytime I went to the store. Maybe get them occassionally when I haven't used them in a while."
5.00,"Wow, your mouth feels great after this rinse! Using the toothpaste then the rinse makes teeth and mouth feel so clean. I can't wait to see what review my dentist gives my shiny, clean teeth! :)"
5.00,"I have been using the crest pro-health toothpaste for a while now and I have to say that it is my favorite. The clinical did not seem to be much different than the other pro-health toothpaste. It makes my mouth feel cleaner than any other brand I've tried. The price is not bad either. The one thing that I don't like about it is that it does not foam up enough but this is a very minor complaint because it still gets my teeth cleaner than any other toothpaste."
5.00,"I like how slick and clean my teeth felt after using this and my whole mouth felt clean as well. I think this really can cut down and get rid of plaque if used consistently. It has what I look for in a toothpaste. Not just fresh breath and clean teeth but works on plaque and/or other problems as well."
4.00,"I started using this toothpaste for my gingivitis. It really does work wonders! My bottom gums had started to get infected so I used this along with occasional lemon juice to keep away the bad bacteria. This combined with whatever home remedy of your choice WILL WORK!Only CON: Yes, there will be build up in most people, but this is normal & nothing to be alarmed of! It does NOT mean your skin is falling off! LOL! Trust me, I have been using this for about 7 months! All you have to do is take a q-tip about 15-20 mins after use & swab around in your mouth to all the crevices. This is not such a bad thing to have to do anyway. Make sure that after you brush with Crest Pro Health Gum Protection, you rinse your mouth with water thoroughly before using your mouth wash/Listerine.I have never bought into the \"prevents ya-da-ya-da after ___ weeks\" products, but Crest wasn't kidding! If you have gingivitis, BUY THIS! :)Thank you, Crest for such a wonderful product!"
5.00,"My husband enjoyed using the Crest Plaque Control and said it did help prevent plaque build-up."
5.00,"I have always liked this brand of mouth wash, and I would buy it again in a heart beat. I love the way it makes me mouth feel cleansed after a rinse."
4.00,"Good taste. Seems to work as claimed. My dentist advices to use this product."
2.00,"I tried this toothpaste twice because I liked the taste and I thought maybe the first trial's effects were by chance, but it's true- this toothpaste makes the topmost lining of your cheeks come off. You'll notice it throughout the day, thinking you have unchewed food stuff in your teeth or something, only to reach into your mouth and pull out a big string of skin cells (or whatever it is). The problem goes away when you stop using the toothpaste. I will not buy this stuff again."
3.00,"This toothpaste tastes fine and it cleans my teeth pretty well, I don't really have a problem with tooth sensitivity but it is also just plain good working toothpaste. So, it is not only good for people with tooth sensitivity, also the whole family."
3.00,"I have a problem with this line of products from Crest. They seem to stain my teeth a terrible brown color. I will stick with the regular basic Crest tartar control paste."
5.00,"It works great!! My teeth felt so much cleaner, and I loved the taste of it. Not too overwhelming, and it didn't burn my mouth."
1.00,"This rinse sounds like such a good idea, and the first time I used it, it cleaned my teeth really well. However, after a couple days of use, following the directions exactly, I noticed that I couldn't taste anything and the tip of my tongue was red and irritated, as if it had been burnt. I used it for a couple more days because I thought I probably had to just get used to it after not routinely using mouthwash for a while. It only became worse, I still couldn't taste anything, my gums began to ache, and my tongue became so painful that I couldn't talk or eat without sharp pain on the tip of my tongue. I stopped using it, but now, a few days later, I'm still having sharp pain on the tip of my tongue. I took a closer look and realized that not only were my tastebuds horribly irritated, but the tip of my tongue split down the middle. I have a high pain tolerance, but this is awful. I sent an email to P&G, and they offered to reimburse the price I paid for the rinse, but also advised that it was safe when used as directed. Oh please. As if I somehow got \"rinse 2 tablespoons for one minute twice a day\" wrong?? It sounds almost unreasonable for an oral rinse to affect me this much, but it's so frustrating and painful. I cook a lot and I haven't been able to taste or eat much of anything I've made for about a week. I hope P&G reformulates soon!!"
5.00,"Gives my mouth a fresh, clean feeling without the bitter after-taste. Ready to try some of the other products in the line."
5.00,"This product left my mouth feeling very clean and refreshing."
5.00,"I've been using the Crest Clinical Strength mouthwash for the last couple months, and I absolutely love it. My mouth feels fresh even hours after using it. I have paired it with the toothpaste as well, and I can definitely tell that my mouth is cleaner and more fresh. I don't have any issues with loss of taste or anything else that others have posted. I do rinse my mouth with water after I use the mouthwash because it is really strong and also leaves a white film... so, others may want to try that. I've had no problems and will continue to use this product."
1.00,"I tried Crest Pro-Health a week ago for two days and it dramatically affected my taste of food and drink. Stopped for four days and my sense of taste slowly came back. Tried it again today and again sense of taste dramatically changed. Cannot taste salt at all. The product on paper looks good, but I cannot use it due to the side effects."
5.00,"I'd seen a couple of commercials, but was skeptical about the product, but after asking our dentist, he actually did recommend it! Hubby and I don't have dental ins, and we both are at the brink of peridontal disease. Not only is the entire line (*or most of it, we've not tried all of them) of the Pro-Health Clinical toothpastes great, we've both noticed a big difference in our smiles. They're brighter, we've reduced the gingivitis, and have healthier mouths overall."
1.00,"After this 3rd or 4th experience of this foamy substance in my mouth after using the toothpaste, I decided to search online for comments and found the previous review about the foaming and red stains.  I'm not sure about the stains, I looked in the mirror after reading that and thought there may be something there, but for sure there is the filmy/mucus-like substance, which I think is most likely a thin layer of skin being peeled off the inside of my mouth!  I thought it was just thick saliva, but it's so thick to chew and when I pull on it it clings so hard to the inside of my mouth that I think it's attached. I usually use natural toothpaste and only tried this because it was free, but I've used plenty of mainstream toothpastes and never experienced anything like this.  But I certainly have no reason to trust Proctor and Gamble, I won't finish the tube and don't recommend anyone trying this nasty stuff."
5.00,"Love the fresh clean feeling that lasts with this product. It does feel like just leaving the dentist's office."
5.00,"The toothpaste left my teeth feeling really clean. It left a really minty fresh breath while keeping your teeth clean."
2.00,"It's too oozy! The end gets gooey, then the cap won't close, then it oozes out all over the place. (It's the middle of winter and our house is cold, I'd hate to see it when the weather gets warm.)"
4.00,"I enjoyed the new Crest, it had a pleasant flavor and kept my teeth feeling clean. I would recommend this product."
5.00,"5 star in my book! This has to be the best toothpaste we have ever used. Crest has always been a great brand but they have out done themselves with this product!"
4.00,"My husband and I both tried out the mouthwash! We really liked it! Especially my husband! Im not as picky as he is so for him to like it is def. a good thing!"
4.00,"The price was reasonable, and the coupons I received were a great perk. I will definitely consider using this toothpaste in the future."
5.00,"This toothpaste made me feel like I just went to the dentist!"
5.00,"Love Crest toothpaste and loved this toothpaste as well. Had a great checkup at the dentist."
1.00,"I wouldn't even give Crest Pro Health one star. This is a TERRIBLE product. After about a month I noticed my teeth were stained around the gums. I could scrap it off only to have it quickly return. I found out from my dentist that Crest was sued because the mouthwash stained people's teeth; so now there is a warning label on the back in the smallest print warning people of possible \"side effects.\" DO NOT BUY. I won't buy anything from Crest ever again."
5.00,"this Crest makes my teeth feel so clean!!! I have even noticed my teeth seem a little whiter as well....I drink alot of tea and sometimes I do get stained teeth, this product is fabulous, and I will recommend it to anyone!!"
5.00,"This product is great...have used for years...only thing wrong with ordering is the shipping...free shipping would be wonderful!"
5.00,"Makes me feel so clean and refreshed! I absolutely love crest mouthwash!"
5.00,"Leaves a great clean feeling! Fresh taste. Will recommend to others."
1.00,"Don't buy this product! We think this product stained his teeth. After using it for a while we were wondering why his teeth were getting brown. It wasn't until we brought he product name up in a dental cleaning session that the dental assistant mentioning this product might be the cause. Once we stopped using the product his teeth go remarkably better."
5.00,"I liked the way it worked, good clean fresh feel ."
4.00,"I am surprised by the few reviews that say the taste is horrible. This is my favorite mouth rinse ever! The flavor is great...not too strong...not too weak. I feel like it leaves my mouth clean for a long time! I also really trust the Crest brand. I use only Crest products and have never had a cavity!"
5.00,"My whole family liked the mouthwash. and for my daughter thats a true contest because she doesn't like any mouthwashes out there"
4.00,"I love the feeling of cleanest possible teeth. This product made my teeth that way period."
5.00,"The toothpaste was refreshing and it felt like I just went to the dentist for a cleaning. It was a bit pricey, but great results."
5.00,"Liked this toothpaste. Wish they'd come up with something non-minty though"
5.00,"I have never used a toothpaste that keeps my mouth feeling so fresh for so long after I brush. I'm amazed at how long the fresh minty taste lasts in my mouth."
2.00,"I just have to write a review on this product for other moms (dads, aunts, grandfathers...) because while this toothpaste worked fine for us tooth-wise, it was a utter disaster bathroom-wise.For whatever reason, Crest Pro-Health is less viscous than Crest's other toothpastes. This means that if you have children who don't put the cap back on the tube that you can expect a big pool of sticky fluid waiting for you in the morning. Honestly, I was constantly finding this turquoise goo all over the bathroom. So much so that I threw half a tube away.Summary :::Crest makes some fine products. I didn't find anything wrong with Pro-Health except that it's messy. Consequently I'd advise people with small children in the house (or absent minded partners) to buy something else.Pam T~"
5.00,"Crest Pro-Health Clinical rinse works great for making my mouth feel fresh and clean."
3.00,"Several months ago, I began to notice that my gums were receding. At first, I didn't believe it to be anything serious. I wasn't a regular flosser, so I assumed that flossing would correct the problem. When it didn't, I went down to the local drug store and purchased nearly every product that claimed to hold a solution to my gum problem. Crest Pro-Health toothpaste and rinse were among my purchases. After the first brushing, I noticed the peeling that everyone is complaining about. The inside of my mouth began to shed soon after I brushed my teeth. This didn't bother me. After 3 weeks, my gums had improved but I noticed dark stains between my teeth. Online reviews told me the stains were coming from the Pro-Health rinse, so I immediately discontinued the rinse. I continued to use the toothpaste, and my gums continued to improve. The stains between my teeth did not improve. I didn't even consider that the toothpaste could be part of the problem until I went out of town for 2 days and had to use another paste. The staining improved drastically within two days. It has now been 5 days since I've used Pro-Health toothpaste and my stains are almost completely gone. I am hesitant to say that this toothpaste stained my teeth, but I can say for sure that it did not help the situation. (Though I do know that the toothpaste contains an ingredient that can cause staining.) If you're on the fence with this product and your gums are in bad shape, use it. If your gums are ok, then I wouldn't risk the staining."
5.00,"Great product! Left my teeth feeling super clean! You can actually feel it working."
5.00,"I do have sensitive teeth and gums, so I tend to be careful which toothpaste I use. However, I'm a Crest user from way back and was looking forward to trying this. Well, the toothpaste was fabulous. It was gentle on my teeth and gums, while still cleaning beautifully. My teeth look white and strong and the scent is attractive. Now, I don't drink much coffee, tea or other drinks like that, so I can't speak to the stain-fighting power. I can only say that, when I use this toothpaste, my teeth look very clean. I'll keep using it!"
5.00,"Great product! Clean teeth and fresh mouth! LOVE IT"
5.00,"This mouthwash was just ok. I'm not sure it was worth the price."
3.00,"Works well and maintains a clean feeling, but so does the non clinical version. Will continue to buy he regular pro health products."
5.00,"I love this rinse, males my mouth and teeth feel very clean"
5.00,"wonderful fresh feeling after brushing, my teeth feel so clean. definitely will continue to puchase this toothpaste"
4.00,"I've been using this product for the past few month and was happy when my dentist told me that my teeth are pretty much plaque free!"
4.00,"I've only used the toothpaste foe a few days but so far so good"
4.00,"this makes your teeth feel really clean, but it doesn't last long enough."
5.00,"As always Crest delivers with excellent products ! I keep thinking there is no way that they can improve upon their products and then- again- I am surprised ! Crest products are THE product that maintain that \"I just came from the dentist clean\":) Thanks Crest !"
5.00,"Very strong taste of mint and cheers me up in the morning. Think I will subscribe from the next purchase."
5.00,"The toothpaste works great. It cleans your teeth beautifully and freshens your mouth at the same time. I will continue to buy it."
3.00,"I tried the Crest Pro-Health toothpaste. It cleaned my teeth well but I didn't feel like it left my entire mouth feeling clean and fresh. I didn't care for the texture of the gel either. It was too gritty."
5.00,"This is one of the rare toothpastes that actually leaves your mouth feeling clean after you use it. It is not watery and does a great job freshening breath. It may not be made with scope but I feel my mouth is cleaner after using this than I do with using different toothpaste and using mouthwash."
1.00,"6 months of using this product: I have multiple wear spots and dark brown stains on my teeth at the gumline, plus 2 enamel colored fillings are now yellow-beige. The inside of my mouth and the tip of my tongue feel burned and that slimely goo that developed within a half hour of brushing was the inside of my mouth peeling off.I saw my dentist today and within 2 minutes of me starting to list my dental concerns, she asked me if I used Crest Pro Health Toothpaste, and if I did, stop immediately, explaining the damage done. She was able to remove the stains, the wear spots haven't breached the enamel (I made be able to rebuild it with proper care) but my fillings are permenantly stained. Time should reverse the mouth pain.I stopped at the drugstore on the way home, picked up 2 tubes of the toothpaste she recommended and threw out the Crest Pro Health when I got home. I'm hoping that this product hasn't caused any irreversible damage. I've done some research online and it appears that there are several more serious side effects reported, with skin peeling off the inside of your mouth being number one complaint.Don't merely not buy this product; avoid it."
4.00,"i love the way it made my teeth feel clean it did a really good job n i would buy this product again!!"
4.00,"I am enjoying this product - leaves my teeth feeling smooth, fresh, and clean. Good minty taste too!"
5.00,"This product has a great smell and taste and leaves your mouth feeling fresh. I would definitely recommend this product."
5.00,"I've been using Crest toothpaste all of my life, and think it is the best brand out there. The Pro-Health Clinical toothpaste is excellent, and does a good job of keeping plaque off teeth."
5.00,"This product has a great taste and it doesn't burn your mouth when using it. I have used this as well as other members in my house and we have really appreciated Crest making such a great product that really helps our mouth feel clean and refreshed."
4.00,"I really loved this and how it made my teeth and mouth feel. Helped my mouth feel clean and refreshing."
4.00,"I liked it, and felt like my teeth were very clean. Even in the morning, they felt freshly brushed although of course I brushed again!"
1.00,"This stuff has to be the WORST mouthwash I have ever used. I used it for two days (morning and evening). After the first use, I noted some loss in taste and thought that I had eaten too soon after using the rinse. After day two I awoke in pain. Not only was my tongue swollen, but it felt like it was on fire. I skipped the mouth wash, and when I ate breakfast I noticed my sense of taste was still dulled. It has been two days now since I've stopped using this product, and I'm still having some swelling, taste has not fully recovered, and I can't believe it's from a mouthwash! Keep in mind, I only used it for 2 days! I have not had the pleasure of experiencing the staining, but I did hear from my dental hygienist that this does in fact have the tendency to stain teeth very badly. I'd recommend skipping this at all costs, and picking a different alcohol free mouthwash. I hope you have the fortune of reading these reviews prior to making this unnecessarily bad life experience..."
5.00,"This is a great product. My family actually love using the toothpaste, mouth wash, and even the floss. My teeth felt clean and refreshed after using these products. Keep up the great work!!"
5.00,"At my last dental checkup, the dentist told me my teeth and gums have never looked this healthy. The only change I've made has been using Pro-Health Crest."
4.00,"My comment is on the toothpaste. It seemed to take away the plax....as I'd put my tongue over my teeth and it was very smooth. The flavor was great and my mouth felt very fresh. I loved it."
5.00,"leaves my mouth fresh and clean. I will buy this product again."
5.00,"Teeth feel nice and smooth. Love using this product! Will burn at first but after a while you get use to it."
1.00,"I hate this toothpaste! It leaves slime like mouth boogers all over my mouth. It can take 10 minutes to get it all out. Pretty embarassing out in public. I threw mine away."
4.00,"Love the taste and made my teeth feel very clean. I would highly recommend it."
1.00,"I have had a terrible experience which I believe is connected to Crest Pro-Health Clinical Rinse and Crest Pro-Health Clinical Toothpaste. I was using another rinse and decided to try Crest Pro-Health Clinical Rinse. The taste is horrible (you feel like you're rinsing your mouth with Windex) and your mouth will burn afterwards but I thought if it works, it's worth it. Then I started to develop brown stains on the edges of my teeth. I'm getting older so I attributed this to age. The dentist was not overly concerned and he was able to get the stains off in my normal teeth cleaning, but a few weeks after the cleaning, back came the stains. Worried about the stains, I decided to step up my game and try Crest Pro-Health Clinical toothpaste. THEN I started to develop serious gum irritation and tooth pain. My gums are raw, I feel like my gums are receding, and my teeth often hurt so much I have to take pain medication. I'm miserable. Worried about my symptoms, I looked on the internet and found that Crest Pro-Health Clinical products were the culprit! Procter & Gamble fully acknowledges that the rinse WILL cause the brown staining, although this warning is nowhere on the bottle. I'm not sure why a company would think it's OK for an oral rinse to stain teeth! And that's just one side affect - there are more and much more serious than staining. I think I got off easy. And then the internet is flooded with reports of the toothpaste causing serious gum irritation and teeth pain. I don't think this gum irritation is temporary, I think I've permanently damaged my gums. I have two new bottles of the rinse and two new tubes of the paste that are going into the trash. These are awful, awful products. Research them, and you'll see."
5.00,"I really love how my teeth feels clean after brushing my teeth."
5.00,"Only toothpaste I will use...cleans great and is very refreshing. Great check ups every time!!!"
5.00,"This toothpaste is great! Leaves your teeth feeling \"squeaky\" clean. Taste is wonderful too!"
4.00,"I just want everyone to try this Crest plaque tooth paste. It really does make your teeth and mouth feel really clean like from your dentist office. I found that the clean feeling last awhile unlike other paste I've used. You won't be sorry for trying it. Me and my family loves it. Thank you Vocalpoint for the chance to try it. I may never use another paste."
4.00,"left my teeth feeling clean and my breath fresh smelling, tasted good too"
4.00,"Overall, this is a nice collection of oral health items. My favorite item is the floss, which is fantastic for my hard-to-floss, tightly spaced teeth. I can find I can floss very effectively with this floss and the floss does not shred like other flosses I have used. I have been using Crest toothpaste for years and this \"all in one\" formation that is designed to freshen breath, reduce gingivitis, remove plaque and tartar, whiten teeth, and be good for sensitivity. I've never had sensitive teeth before, and after using this I have been having some pain along the gumline. At my last cleaning, I mentioned this to my hygienist who said that whitening products increase sensitivity and she thought it was probably a bit more than this product could promise to do all of that. Anyway, after switching back to my old toothpaste, the sensitivity has gone away so I am suspicious of this toothpaste. It was otherwise fine - tasted fine, left my teeth feeling clean - but other toothpastes can do that too without making my teeth hurt. I was also usign the toothbrush, which I found a bit too hard for my teeth too, and probably contributed to the sensitivity I was feeling (I stopped using the brush before stopping the toothpaste and still had sensitivity even with a soft brush, so I do think the toothpaste was the major cause). As for the Pro-Health rinse, I am a bit hit or miss on it. I am used to using Listerine, but was interested in trying something different and with a better flavor, so I tried this rinse. It was ok - I felt like it worked well, but my breath didn't feel fresh for as long as it did with the Listerine, but overall it was an ok mouth rinse. Overall, I still like Crest products and will continue to use them, but I probably won't ever use the toothpaste again."
5.00,"I use this product every day and I have recommended this product to all of my friends and family"
3.00,"I tried this toothpaste and for me I did not like the taste. My husband did like it though. I found that it did not keep my breath fresh for very long and my teeth felt funny by the end of the day. I felt that I had to re-brush a few hours after using it."
1.00,"I would never recommend this to anyone. Quite the contrary, I would warn people against it. Many people have an allergy to the type of fluoride in this toothpaste, but toothpaste is the last thing you think of when you're having an allergic reaction to something in your mouth. I struggled with painful mouth sores and was waking up every morning with my lips so swollen they were splitting and bleeding before I finally discovered it was this toothpaste. As soon as I quit using it, my lips stopped swelling. If you don't believe it, just check out what these 438 people have to say: [...] This should be taken off the shelves immediately."
4.00,"I only use Crest products, from toothpaste to mouthwash and other whitening products. Love it!"
5.00,"I really enjoy using this mouthwash because it doesnt burn your mouth when you use it. Also it leaves a great taste in your mouth after wards. I highly recommend this mouthwash to everyone! If you want a fresh clean feeling from a mouthwash then this one is the right one for you! good luck"
3.00,"This was fine, wasn't any different than the other crest toothpaste's"
5.00,"This mouthwash really does leave your mouth feeling fresh and clean. The minty taste is long lasting and lets you feel confident."
5.00,"I love this product and am devastated they have discontinued making it!!! I was even told by my hygenist that using this product at night actually kept the plaque and tartar from getting so bad and made it easier to get off the teeth. PLEASE BRING BACK THIS TOOTHPASTE!!!!!!!"
4.00,"Just tried the crest toothpaste and it was great. Left my mouth feeling fresh and clean."
4.00,"I have been a Crest customer for as long as I can remember- more recently I've been purchasing the Pro-Health, mint flavored, whitening tube. The Crest Pro-health For Life, Smooth Mint Flavor was given to me for review by Amazon. In short, I like it. Cons: -The gritty texture -If you leave the toothpaste on your toothbrush for more than a couple minutes, the toothpaste sort of melts into the bristles Pros: -Light Mint flavor! -Mouth feels fresh and clean I have been using this toothpaste for a couple weeks and there really isn't anything about it that distinguishes it from other toothpastes that Crest makes. Maybe I just need to use it longer. Regardless, it is still a great toothpaste, especially for those 50+"
4.00,"I love Crest products! As always, it didn't dissappoint. My mouth felt fresh and clean, and I felt I got a great value!"
4.00,"This toothpaste is awesome. Whitened my teeth and made my mouth feel fresh for hours!"
5.00,"I enjoyed using this product and could feel that it was working almost immediately. I feel it is improving my oral health already."
3.00,"As you can see, I really like Crest toothpaste. This one isn't at the bottom of the list, but it just wasn't for me."
5.00,"This toothpaste is wonderful - it made my mouth feel fresh and clean. Will use it again!"
5.00,"In only 15 days, my teeth are actually gettting whiter and the obvious swelling of my gums is going down. (I actually didn't even realize they were swollen until it started going down!) My mouth really does feel cleaner and healthier! Grats to Crest!"
4.00,"Been using with the same mouth wash for a couple of months, but only once a day.  No real problems and my gums are bleeding less.  I like that the mouth wash has no alcohol.  I'm concerned about the stains and lack of taste in other reviews here and on the mouth wash page.  I don't think my teeth are any whiter or more yellow though.  No \"peeling\" either.  I am trying Biotene PBF instead right now and will report how it compares."
4.00,"I have very sensitive teeth and not only did this toothpaste not sting, but it really leaves your teeth feeling as smooth and clean as when you leave the dentist's office!"
2.00,"This has to be the worst toothpaste I have ever used. It dries my mouth, leaves a film around your gums/teeth (FYI: don't `swallow it!) and I developed a sore throat which after a month made me sound like a heavy smoker with emphysema<-probably because of swallowing the film/toothpaste for a month. I thought I was getting sick even went to the doctor. Doctors said it's something that is irritating my throat, maybe allergies?. I've lived in the same area my whole life why would all of sudden in my last twenties get allergic to something. Well turns out it was this toothpaste! And the only reason I found out because when I finally ran out of pro health went to the local pharmacy, they didn't' carry it so I just settled on another kind of toothpaste. Symptoms cleared up and I was back to my normal self. Although my experience was beyond strange, I would suggest you get a travel size or a small tube just to test it out, that's if you are willing to go through the possible side effects of this product. You never know it may work for you but based on my own experience, what I have read on here and other reviews..it's a no go and will never again buy this product."
4.00,"This mouthwash was great! I have used the ProHealth products before and this did not disappoint. The mouthwash worked well and didn't burn."
4.00,"I am not one to write reviews but appreciate those who do.I have used Crest all my life and will continue to do so .I love the taste, the gridded feel of the paste, and everything about this toothpaste, EXCEPT for the fact that this gel-like paste pours out of the tube each and every time the cap is left open...I've cleaned up more paste puddles both on the sink and onto the floor then used from this toothpaste. Once this starts its hard to close the cap unless cleaned out. I hate wasting a product I paid for and I'm too busy chasing family members daily to close the cap on a daily basis. So a new & efficient container would be great."
4.00,"I love the Crest products! They are reasonably priced and work so well. My teeth feel and look great!"
4.00,"Leaves mouth/breath feeling clean and fresh without the burn!"
5.00,"Made my mouth feel fresh and clean, I will buy this product again."
5.00,"Aloha, I took mine to Hawaii on vacation and loved the taste and smell it left it in my mouth. I will definitely use this daily. In fact my sister was very curious about this Crest Plaque control product so feel like she will be using also. Thank you for the sample probably would not have purchased but since I have tried and really like it I will be purchasing."
3.00,"i thought the mouthwash could have had a better taste, it left a bad after taste in my mouth"
5.00,"I LOVE THIS TOOTHPASTE MY IT LEFT MY TEETH CLEAN AND MOUTH FEELING GREAT. GREAT TOOTHPASTE LOVED IT."
5.00,"My mouth and teeth and gums felt very clean after using Crest ProHealth. Just as clean as dental office."
5.00,"I liked this toothpaste and will use again. It really made my mouth and teeth feel cleaner and fresher. I could feel the difference after using it. Great flavor too."
5.00,"I enjoyed the taste of this toothpaste. My teeth felt extremely clean and my breath was fresh after brushing. I am hard to please when it comes to toothpaste flavor, I was definatly not disappointed."
5.00,"This is a great product and worth the money! My teetth feel extra clean and not burning up like other brands."
5.00,"I have been using ProHealth products for a few weeks. When I got my teeth cleaned yesterday, the hygenist said my gums were much healthier. Glad to have found a product that is pleasant to use and effective!"
5.00,"I used to be a strictly Colgate kind of girl, but after trying these Crest products, I'm a convert! Very clean feeling in my mouth and lasting freshness. Can't wait to see what the dentist has to say."
5.00,"Made my mouth feel sparkling clean! Would definitively buy again!"
4.00,"THIS TOOTHPASTE IS VERY GOOD - GOOD ON CLEANING AND SENSITIVITY ISSUES."
1.00,"After only two days of using this product I began noticing problems. Directly after brushing my teeth the second morning I had an onset of nausea and a headache and began to have a film forming over the inside of my mouth & coming off. This film, i found out after some research, was the lining on the inside of my mouth being chemically burned. This product may be good for those who already have bad gingivitis, but should not be used, in my opinion, as a preventative measure. I will not be purchasing this product again, and I'm sure my mouth will appreciate it."
5.00,"I am always searching for a mouthwash that has multiple benefits. It helps to keep your mouth very clean and also provides plaque and gingivitis protection. It made my mouth feel very clean and protected all day."
5.00,"Kept my mouth feeling clean and fresh! Great product!"
5.00,"This toothpaste worked much better than my normal toothpaste. It seemed to get and keep my mouth cleaner longer. I felt like it kept my breath fresher longer too."
5.00,"I think the products are great. Fresh clean feeling and love the floss-won't shred between my tight teeth!"
4.00,"I really liked that this product doesn't burn your mouth like some mouth washes do.It was mild yet effective.However it was a little pricey"
5.00,"didn't burn my mouth like some, still got that refreshing feeling. recommended."
5.00,"My teeth stayed cleaner longer and felt fresher longer than with any other product I've ever used. This has to be one of the best toothpastes on the market right now."
4.00,"I've been using Crest Pro-Health Clean Mint Toothpaste Twin Pack, 6-Ounce Tubes for years, and was curious to see how the new \"50+\" version compared to the original. The active ingredient (Stannous fluoride 0.454%) is identical in both products and they both claim to protect against plaque, gingivitis and sensitivity. So where does the \"Over 50\" label come in? The `smooth mint' flavor of the \"For Life\" version has a slightly less gritty texture than the original `clean mint' formula. And I do mean \"slightly\" - the `smooth mint' still has a definite grittiness to it. If that texture bothers you then I don't think this is the toothpaste for you. Other stuff to consider... I like the flip top - I find it much neater and (let's face it) nobody in my house can be bothered to screw the cap back on the tube. Ever. It has a slightly sweet, minty flavor which I find pleasant, but of course that is strictly subjective. While I liked the product, I don't think that this \"new\" formulation offers any particular advantage over the original. Bottom Line: A good quality all around toothpaste regardless of your age. Not recommended for those who prefer a smooth, non-gritty toothpaste."
3.00,"I really like this toothpaste but I HATE the cap. It doesn't snap closed easily and if you don't close it all the way it leaks all over the place. PG, you either need to make a more solid product or it would probably be easier to make a better cap."
5.00,"I have officially switched toothpaste! It leaves your mouth feeling clean (almost like dentist cleaning clean). I definitely recommend to others ... I have told failyand friends about it and a few of them had to try it for themselves ... and they liked it!"
5.00,"We have always used Crest in our house, maybe just by force of habit. However, this product reminds me why. It tastes good but more importantly does a great job."
5.00,"We were, for the longest time, a couple which 'felt the burn' each time we used our mouthwash. That all ended with the Crest ProHealth mouthwash, which provides an equal (if not better) clean without the searing burning sensation. Highly recommended!"
5.00,"Will buy again! Great product! Left my mouth fresh and clean!"
4.00,"Left my teeth feeling clean and fresh... has a great taste"
3.00,"Keep in mind that this is an Oral Rinse not mouthwash! We really don't care for Oral Rinse products so we really didn't care for this Crest Pro Healh Oral Rinse either. It does a good job and does what it says but we just aren't fans."
5.00,"I was surprised to see the negative reviews of this product. I have been using this particular toothpaste for more than a year. Never had any problems with it and no gingivitis at my latest dental appointment."
4.00,"It gives your teeth a nice clean feel and keeps your breath fresh longer than regular toothpaste"
5.00,"The toothpaste does a great job cleaning your teeth and leaving them feeling like it's done a deep clean. It has a nice minty flavor. I would highly recommend this toothpaste."
5.00,"The taste is great with no burn. My mouth felt straight from the dentist clean."
5.00,"This product made my mouth and teeth feel so clean. It had a wonderful taste."
5.00,"This mouthwash works great! One rinse last for hours. My breath stays fresh and plaque stays away. I also enjoy this mouthwash because it does not sting or dry my mouth."
1.00,"I cannot believe this crap. I am in-between jobs and have excellent health except for using crest pro-health toothpaste. I just moved and started a new job that I can't go to because my lips are triple the size with cuts and bleeding. My gums are so sensitive they bleed when brushing and I have pieces of my cheeks falling off with many sores inside my mouth. I have an extra tongue underneath my real tongue made up of sores. I cannot eat or drink without severe pain. It started with a film in my mouth followed by blood blisters and then came the rest of hell's angels. I will never buy crest again and feel they owe me and other a LOT of $. False advertising, pain and suffering, medical bills, and loss of work. I wish this feeling on no one and hope Crest will do the right thing and take this crap off the market and admit their wrongs."
4.00,"This mouthwash was great in that it did not burn. I liked it's taste but hubby did not care for aftertaste."
5.00,"It was great to try a sample of the product before investing in a full size product. I will definitely be looking for this on my store shelves. It left my teeth feeling really clean and my breath fresh. No gritty feeling, nice foaming action while brushing."
5.00,"Excellent taste and texture, and the 2 pack is an excellent value. I have been using this brand for years..."
5.00,"This toothpaste is amazing. It tastes great and really did keep my teeth feeling cleaner."
5.00,"love the product - would buy it again and again - highly recommend"
4.00,"It left my teeth and mouth feeling clean and refreshed"
4.00,"I enjoyed the clean refreshing feeling it left in my mouth however I wish it wasn't as pricey."
5.00,"I really like this Crest Toothpaste. I have sensitive teeth and gums and this toothpaste is a good match for me. The Invigorating Clean Mint Flavor is really great. It almost feels as if it's warming up a bit as I'm brushing. I really like it. This toothpaste cleans my teeth very well and I like the fact that it helps to prevent Gingivitis. I've had Gingivitis a couple times in the past so it's nice having something that's clinically proven to help prevent that. I really like this toothpaste and would highly recommend it."
5.00,"I have been using some of the other Crest ProHealth toothpaste and loved them. I would say this is right up there with the other Crest Prohealth varities. My teeth felt clean and refreshed after brushing. I like that it also helps against sensivity which is an issue for me. I will be interested to see what my dentist says about the tartar when I go for my next check up."
5.00,"I have had many mouthwashes that I can hardly stand because they just burn. But I love that I can get an awesome clean, but without any burn!"
5.00,"I am a loyal Crest toothpaste purchaser and I love the new toothpaste. My teeth feel as clean as going to the dentist."
4.00,"This product had a great taste, and made my teeth feel squeaky clean.......and my breath felt fresher for a longer time then with regular toothpaste!"
4.00,"Crest Pro-Health Complete with Fluoride is an alcohol free mouth rinse that provides you with all the regular benefits of a mouth rinse but with the added benefit of fluoride and without the burn of the ones that contain alcohol. I have read lots of bad reviews about this mouth rinse, mostly concerning staining. I have been using it myself for a couple of weeks and haven't had any issues with it at all. I haven't had any staining and have enjoyed the fresh mint flavor. I prefer the alcohol free mouth rinses the best. This one has the added fluoride but if you are concerned with the risk of teeth staining I may try another one since the teeth stain warnings are even included right on the bottle."
4.00,"It truly cleans without the sting but the after taste ruins my palate."
4.00,"I love Crest products in general because my teeth feel clean. Crest Pro-Health was great, but didn't feel any different."
4.00,"My teeth have gotten sensitive with age but since Sensodyne gives me sticker shock, I look around for cheaper alternatives. This toothpaste is all right as far as how it feels and how clean it makes my teeth. I was never a big fan of the taste of Crest - always liked the taste of Colgate better - but this gel version is better than their paste version."
5.00,"The whole family liked this toothpaste. It made our mouths feel fresh and clean!"
4.00,"My teeth felt almost as good as when the dentist cleans them. They still felt clean the next morning. I would recommend this product."
4.00,"Overall, I felt the product did a good job at keeping my teeth clean. It left a nice taste in my mouth after using it and my mouth felt clean for a while afterwards. I would recommend this product to a friend."
5.00,"I have tried other toothpastes but am never as satisfied as I am with Crest. I want a \"minty fresh\" feeling after I brush with very clean teeth. Crest always provides that for me and I am never disappointed! I highly recommend this product."
4.00,"I really like this crest pro health. It makes my teeth feel really clean and I like the taste."
5.00,"It didn't taste too strong and made my mouth/teeth feel clean."
5.00,"Love the Crest protection toothpaste. Always feels fresh and love the benefits!"
4.00,"The product has no burn and my mouth feels clean and fresh all day. But it leaves an unpleasant aftertaste and residue after use."
5.00,"I really enjoyed trying the toothpaste out. It seems to address everything, including my biggest issue, tooth sensitivity. The invigorating clean mint flavor was really nice and fresh too. I think that the only thing that I could think of improving is maybe switching out the sodium lauryl sulfate that is in the product, because some of my family members are sensitive to it. (Pretty much all toothpastes contain this ingredient, so there is probably only a small percentage of people who need to watch out for it) But otherwise, it works fantastic for me. I will look for it again in the future!"
1.00,"I normally use a competing mouthwash which has alcohol in it, so bought this on a whim thinking I would try something new. It leaves you with a horrible aftertaste that persists for hours. I thought maybe there was something wrong with it or with me, after seeing these other reviews I can see it is just a bad product. I'll be throwing the bottle out after just one use. Thanks but no thanks."
4.00,"I began using this toothpaste after going to the dentist so I could keep the plaque away longer! So far, it has been working!"
5.00,"I have this mouthwash and I like it a lot more than the other mouthwash I was using. It is a great price and a great value for my money. I love the way it makes my teeth and tongue feel when I spit it out. So fresh and ready to take on the day and not worry about my breath."
4.00,"The toothpaste made my mouth feel really clean and fresh. It has a good flavor and texture. I would recommend this product."
1.00,"I have to admit that when it comes to my oral hygiene (because there's an awful lot of $$ in my mouth!) I do everthing I can to keep my teeth in good condition.  So, when I noticed these small brown spots at my bottom gumline, I could not imagine what it could be from.  Yes, I'm a coffee/tea drinker, but I have been for years, and I have never had any staining like this.  Then, I googled teeth staining, and came across this to my astonishment.  I have been using this for the last month, approximately when I noticed the stains.  I hope my dentist belives me.  I'm going to try and file a complaint, but from hereon, I will NEVER use another Crest product again.  I've gone back to good old listerine.  It burns, but it doesn't stain.  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT."
5.00,"The main advantage of Crest Pro-Health is that it uses stannous flouride instead of sodium flouride.  Stannous flouride is better for your teeth, but sodium flouride has a longer shelf life and is a little cheaper.  This is the first stannous flouride option on the market that I'm aware of in years.                                                                     It tastes a little different the first couple times, but I've been using it for months now and have no issues there.  The review with the lady with the teeth issues--I really don't know what's going on there, but if anything like that happens to anyone I guess they should see their dentist ASAP.                                                                     There's also a cinnamon flavor that really isn't what you'd expect from a toothpaste, but is kind of nice."
5.00,"I use this product before bed every night, and it leaves my teeth feeling much cleaner in the morning than without it. So nice to wake up to a clean feeling mouth!"
1.00,"I've only used this toothpaste for a couple of days. So I can't speak to the side effects that other people have mentioned, but I can say this, this is the worst tasting toothpaste I've ever used, and that includes the whitening stuff that doesn't even try to taste good. It's so disgusting that I almost start to gag when I put it in my mouth. I don't know what \"clean mint\" is supposed to refer to, because it's not the taste. Pass."
5.00,"great product works wonderful. keeps my mouth feeling fresh"
3.00,"I purchased the Crest ProHealth Whitening Toothpaste and do like the toothpaste, but the cap will not close so I have toothpaste all over the place. As much as items cost these days, I do not like the fact that so much is wasted because the cap won't close. I will not buy this again until you change the top. I am a P & G stockholder and my father used to work at P & G, so P & G is very close to my heart, but some items I can not buy, such as this one."
5.00,"My teeth look and feel like I am getting a dentist quality cleaning daily."
4.00,"While I really like this toothpaste with it leaving my mouth feeling clean I do wonder why even thoothpaste is becoming ike the food products and getting smaller and spending the same amount?"
3.00,"I did not get the really clean feeling of my teeth after using and it did not last as long as my usual brand. I prefer my regular brand."
5.00,"Well, what can I say. It meets my expectations. It helps freshen my breath and it's not painful like Listerine (even though I can take it). I can comfortable rinse this around in my mouth for a good, long, reasonable amount of time. The minty taste is good for a mouth wash. The funny thing is though, since it does not have the painful effect, I always wondering if it's working."
4.00,"Seemed to work fine and tasted great! It is a bit spendy though. :)"
4.00,"Although I liked this product, I found it to be a bit on the pricey side. I've used a number of different mouth products/rinses, and this one certainly does the job. It's refreshing and doesn't leave a funny aftertaste in your mouth."
1.00,"Purchased from Costco in a four pack. Started having gunk build up in my mouth. Kind of like that morning slime, except far worse, and it did it all the time. I've had excessive salivation because of it too. Would wake up during the night choking on my own spit. Finally put two and two together, quit using it for a few days, and saw an improvement. Decided to Google it today, reviews here, reviews elsewhere, this is an awful product. My husband has been complaining about mouth sores, found another site with reviews and mouth sores complaints. He's been using their mouthwash for quite some time with no issues. Can't believe Crest put this stuff out there."
3.00,"It got my teeth no cleaner than any other toothpaste that I have used. I would not pay the price again."
3.00,"As a baby boomer I am used to products marketed just for my age group, but I didn't realize that I needed special toothpaste. I didn't realize that I experienced \"special dental conditions\" like surface stains, weak enamel, tooth sensitivity, and tender inflamed gums. This toothpaste is supposed to help prevent cavities, gingivitis, plaque, sensitivity, tartar, while whitening teeth and freshening the breath. This comes in a six-ounce package flavored with smooth mint. It does taste good, but it has one ingredient that I am not sure about. If you read anything about toothpaste ingredients you might never brush your teeth again, but the ingredient that concerns me is the silica, an abrasive. Your teeth are smooth when you finish brushing. I am not sure that using an abrasive every time you brush is good for the enamel. This toothpaste says that it is step two of three steps, floss, brush, and rinse, and then see your dentist regularly. My dentist says that my teeth are great. I don't have any of the problems that this toothpaste says I might have over 50. I can't see why this kind of toothpaste would be needed more than regular toothpaste. The cap does not close well and so the toothpaste will come out unless you place the tube with the top up. The type of fluoride that they used might stain your teeth... and it says so right on the box... so I am not sure why they did not just use the same kind of fluoride of other toothpastes."
5.00,"I love Crest Pro Health Mouthrinse. Every time I use it, it leaves my mouth feeling super fresh and clean! I would definitely keep buying."
4.00,"It had a great taste; however, I have only used it for over a week & don't see any improvement in the color of my teeth."
1.00,"I started using Crest Pro-Health night toothpaste in January. By Feb I had developed a pronounced discoloration on my teeth, particularly between teeth. It looked like I chewed tobacco. I tried brushing harder, flossing more and mouthwashes, but it continued to get worse. I went to my regular dentist appt expecting to be told my teeth were rotting away. Much to my relief my dentist was able to remove most of it. It has be be scrapped off. She suppected it was a stannous fluoride rinse, but my rinse was ok, it was the toothpaste. This is a horribe product."
5.00,"This is my favorite toothpaste. Not only do I like the taste, it leaves my teeth and mouth feeling fresh and clean. Even the kids like it."
5.00,"I love this product. I have always been a fan of Crest product but this mouth wash is better than I expected. My mouth felt very refreshing."
4.00,"I thought it worked great. tasted fresh and made my mouth fresh too!"
4.00,"Taste great toothpaste. Not sure how well it fights plaque as I haven't had my check up yet."
4.00,"I love all of the Crest Pro Health products, I think they are top of the line."
5.00,"Between this mouthwash and flossing, I've seen a great improvement in the health of my gums. The flavor is a little strange (almost sweet versus the traditional bite of a mouthwash), but I got used to it."
5.00,"Gave me that fresh from the dentist feeling. I will use this product again."
4.00,"Crest and Colgate dental hygiene products have been around for years and are names that I trust. If I cannot buy one, I'll buy the other. Typically I lean toward Crest and this particular Crest product was a great deal I couldn't pass on."
3.00,"I like the sensitive formula I guy locally, but for whatever reason after brushing with this formula, a white \"pasty\" like substance starts forming in the mouth... not sure what's up with that, but we'll have to deal with it as we have 6 of them..."
5.00,"This toothpaste does help your gums. I had a small spot on my gums that were becoming a little red and puffy and regular brushings with the Crest pro health clinical took it away. I enjoy the invigorating feeling this paste leaves behind. Will continue to use."
1.00,"I noticed after the very first time of using this that I lost my sense of taste for 12+ hours. Just to be this is the cause I tried a few more times and sure enough - this is the cause. Google reviews before using any Crest Pro-Health mouthwash. Apparrently it also causes brown staining on teeth within 1-2 bottles. Google it - you'll be glad you did."
1.00,"I was researching on what could make me lose taste overnight. I then came across all of this and let me tell you how relieved I am to know I don't have a brain tumor or Alzheimers!! I just got this mouthwash 4 days ago and nothing has flavor! I swear I went on an eat-a-thon just to see if I could taste anything!! Thankyou for the reviews so I know what to do.....call the company and get a refund!!"
5.00,"I absolutely love Crest and all it's products. My family and I have been using Crest as long as I can remember."
5.00,"I have used Crest Pro Health for a few years now. It's the best product I've found for my sensitive teeth. And with the numerous varieties and improvements there's always something better on the shelf."
4.00,"This toothpaste made my teeth feel very clean. It is not a whitening tootpaste so don't expect your teeth to get whiter."
5.00,"I love this toothpaste. I have sensitive teeth and have to get the special sensitive toothpaste. It cleaned my teeth great and kept the tempature changes from hurting my teeth. It works great."
1.00,"It took me about a week of using it and googling the internet to realize that this stuff had a horrible reaction in my mouth. Immediately I lost my sense of taste but I didn't realize it was the mouthwash. Then one day my mouth just got nasty, and I brushed and used the mouthwash and felt burning. Then I thought let me do a quick google and apparently I am not alone. This is crazy how it's still on shelves. Perhaps some people don't have this reaction. Use at your own risk."
5.00,"Loved the way this product made my teeth and mouth feel after using."
5.00,"Left my mouth feeling clean and fresh all day long!"
5.00,"I've loved Crest products and have used them for years, and this toothpaste is no different. It left my teeth feeling as clean as they do after leaving the dentist's office, and I love the fresh breath it gave me. I even had squeaky-clean teeth after waking up in the morning after brushing them before bed!"
5.00,"I've always liked Crest mouthwash better than any other brands. They haven't failed me so far."
4.00,"I've used this toothpaste for a couple of weeks now and I really liked it. I do think my teeth feel cleaner and the taste was just right."
4.00,"I have always been a Crest LOVER & this product is no exception. Thank you!"
5.00,"I enjoyed this toothpaste. It made my teeth feel very clean. Will definitely purchase again."
1.00,"I feel a cold twist in my gut, when I see brightly packaged stuff like this. Bright colors in nature often mean toxic ingredients. It doesn't say the ingredients, which is scary. Fluoride is a rat poison, and it has negative effects even in trace amounts. Paying $5 for something that works maybe as well as baking soda doesn't do much for me. God alone knows what other toxins are in this."
1.00,"This product is an absolute horror. I used it for a day and a half and immediately started feeling excruciating pain in my mouth, particularly my gums and tongue. My gums feel like they are burning and stinging and when I looked in the mirror, there are white burn lines along my gums. The pain is constant and it doesn't seem to be going away with anything. I can't believe Crest is selling this product. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT! I dumped the entire bottle down the drain and will probably never use another product from Crest again after this experience. Very disappointed that the FDA is allowing this to be on shelves."
4.00,"I liked the taste and the lack of residue on my teeth. But I didn't notice a significant difference between it and other toothpastes. Its also a bit pricier than the other toothpastes."
4.00,"This is a great product that not only tastes great but you get the added oral health bonus. Very refreshing and my teeth felt sparkly ! I think the value for the product is also a plus."
1.00,"Is there some special ingredient in this toothpaste? I'm trying to narrow it down, but the Crest site does not list the ingredients."
4.00,"this product leaves my mouth feeling very fresh and clean. it is a little pricy, but if it really does all it says it will do then it is well worth the price."
5.00,"My family loves this toothpaste. The flavor is not too strong even for the young family members. We are loyal Crest users Because of the successful dentist checkups we have all had while using Crest."
5.00,"This product worked great. Just like it says, it is alcohol free, so it didn't burn like other mouthwashes can. If you said water was a 1 and the strongest mouthwash you can think of has a \"burn\" level of 10, I would rate this one about a 4. I love how it \"foams\" and I can feel it working on my gums, teeth and tongue. After using, my mouth felt clean, without an overly strong aftertaste as most mouthwashes have. I will definitely recommend and buy again."
5.00,"I love Crest toothpaste. After just one use you can \"feel\" and see a difference. It has a great scent keeping your mouth fresh and tasting good for a long time!"
5.00,"Made my teeth feel cleaner.My breath fresh longer.Loved it."
3.00,"This is a good toothpaste for me in every way but the flavor. My teeth can sometimes be sensitive so I appreciate that aspect and we all want help against cavities, gingivitis, plaque and tartar. When you add in that it has ingredients for whitening and freshening breath, it has pretty much everything an adult wants toothpaste to do. The active ingredient is stannous fluoride 0.45% (0.16% w/v fluoride ion) compared to the sodium fluoride used in the Colgate toothpaste I use the most. There is a warning on the package that stannous fluoride might cause staining. Crest has the following Q&A on its website: \"Why does Crest Pro-Health Toothpaste have a warning about staining? Current FDA regulations require that toothpastes containing stannous fluoride be labeled about their staining potential. But Crest Pro-Health Toothpaste, with our Polyfluorite System(tm), contains a high-cleaning silica and sodium hexametaphosphate, a unique whitening ingredient, to remove and help prevent external stains. This toothpaste has been accepted by the ADA for its whitening benefit.\" My teeth feel very clean when I'm done brushing and I assume Crest has clinical trials that support its claim to help reverse gingivitis in 4 weeks. I also really like the tube they used. This one stands on the large cap end so it takes up less room on my bathroom counter than the typical tube of toothpaste that lies flat. But after all that, it comes down to the taste for me. I don't know if it is because the mint (sort of wintergreen) is too strong for me or if there is a slight amount of bitter ingredient but this toothpaste leaves me with a strong taste on the tip of my tongue that is slightly unpleasant. Taste is such a personal thing that if you are used to the taste of Crest toothpaste, I think you will wonder what I'm talking about."
5.00,"Have used this rinse for at least two years. Dentist compliments. Also alcohol free so it won't age my mouth."
4.00,"I loved the mouthwash & it lasted longer then normal mouthwashes do. (The aftertaste.)"
5.00,"We love Crest Pro-Health Toothpaste. It is our favorite and the one we always buy. We got hooked a few years ago and the Plaque variety is just as good. It leaves your mouth feeling clean with a good taste."
4.00,"Carol"
5.00,"I like the line.It does work well.It is a little expensive for my specific budget.So I probably won't buy the line.I would however recommend the Products to everyone.They make your mouth feel super clean.The Crest Pro heath mouth wash is a bit strong for me.I don't like things that make me fell like i just had medicine.Oveer all a great line."
5.00,"I love Crest Pro health products. I will always use these products and now my daughters familes aree useing it."
4.00,"I love this line of products. My mouth feels clean and fresh everyday. It helps control plaque buildup so that the Dentist doesn't have to work as hard."
4.00,"I noticed less plaque and teeth felt fresh and clean!"
5.00,"I love all Crest Products. Crest Pro Health toothpaste is my favorite. I recommend it to everyone!"
4.00,"We are a family that really sticks with one brand. so when the opportunity to try this product came up, I was a little skeptical but thought ok. Well I should have known with a brand like Crest you cant go wrong. It worked ver well! Left my mouth tasting clean and fresh"
1.00,"After using one small bottle of this rinse many of my teeth turned a terrible dark brown around the gum line and along the edges of fillings. Walmart should stop selling this product."
5.00,"Makes my mouth feel fresh and clean! The best I have ever tried."
5.00,"I will now always buy this product for our house."
5.00,"i love this mouth rinse because one, it doesnt burn/sting your mouth, and two, refreshing feeling after using. Of coarse its even better when you use the floss and toothpaste as well."
5.00,"I love Crest toothpaste. I have always used Crest and this toothpaste is as great as all other Crest toothpastes."
1.00,"I can't believe I'm writing a reveiw about toothpaste, but after using this toothpaste for a week and having severe tooth sensitivity and large amounts of tissue from the inside of my mouth peeling off, I can't in good conscience ignore the problem. I did not believe that Crest could/would make a product that caused me so much pain. I stopped using it for 5 days then tried it again, it definitely was the the Crest pro health toothpaste that caused my discomfort! I hope that some day this horrible sensitivity to everything (air, liquid, heat, cold) will go away.The FDA should pull this product. Be very careful if you buy this product. I won't be using it or any Crest product again ... going back to Colgate."
5.00,"Loved how clean my teeth feel. My dentist was impressed at how well it worked on my plaque."
5.00,"The toothpaste was really amazing, and did just what it advertised - it left me feeling like I'd just left the dentist's office."
5.00,"I loved this mouth rinse. Usually they are too strong and medicine tasting for me. This product was refreshing and just the right mint. It made my mouth feel very clean."
5.00,"I have always gone back to Crest. It's a great product that always works as expected. I didn't see anything special about the clinical version though."
4.00,"The mouth wash left my mouth feeling clean and fresh. It also didn't burn which was nice although it was a bit foamy but overall was a really great product."
5.00,"I will only use this one and now i cant find it(clear mint) the rest out there burn my mouth and taste like crap.  I would buy it here if i knew it was the clear one but the description says it could vary.  I have enough of the ones i dont like in my cupboard and dont want anymore."
4.00,"My daughter was very excited to have \"Jake toothpaste\" and I was happy that it made her more excited to brush. She enjoys the flavor and it rinses easily. It also speaks to the quality that the manufacturer has been responding personally to any complaints."
1.00,"After using this product off and on for about 3 weeks, I've developed taste loss and brown stains (this is with rigourous brushing/flossing, and not drinking soda/sugary drinks). Horrible Horrible product. The brown stains look disgusting, and unhealthy, but the worst is the metallic aftertaste that developed. I stopped taking this mouthwash two days ago and the metallic taste has dissapated,but still lingering. I wish there were red \"warning\" stars to let other people know it's out there; it's still being sold in stores as a legit dental hygiene mouthwash."
5.00,"This was, by far, the best mouth wash I have ever used. It immediately made my teeth and mouth feel clean, and the feeling lasted for so long! I used it frequently before bed, and could still taste the freshness in the morning! I will absolutely buy this again."
5.00,"Love this toothpaste... really felt DENTIST-OFFICE clean after! Would definitely continue to use!"
5.00,"I've only tried the toothpaste so far, and it makes my teeth feel so clean. They also seem to stay clean longer than when I use other toothpaste."
5.00,"smooth paste yet effectively left a very clean feeling of my teeth"
3.00,"Didn't care for the taste...but was effective none the less."
4.00,"This rinse has a pleasant taste although I do like to rinse well again with water after 30 minutes to remove the aftertaste. I've been using it just a couple of weeks so it's too soon how effective it is at reducing plaque."
4.00,"This had a great taste and left my teeth feeling clean"
5.00,"With most toothpastes, I can brush my teeth before bed, and when I wake up in the morning, I have a film of plaque on my teeth. With this product, I woke up in the morning with my teeth feeling just as plaque free as when I went to sleep! Amazing product!!"
4.00,"This is one of those toothpastes that tastes a little bit medicinal. That's not such a bad thing, but the aftertaste does remind you a little bit of after you've rinsed with hydrogen peroxide. The texture is somewhere between a paste and a gel, a bit more like a gel than the \"Invigorating Clean Mint\", which is my favorite of these Crest Clinical toothpastes that I've tried."
5.00,"crest has knocked it out of the park with this new line of products.!"
5.00,"I love the Pro health tooth paste before this one. I can't believe it is improved. WoW. Can't go wrong w/it if you don't want plaque to build up as soon after you brush. Love it!!!!"
5.00,"Good product. Highly recommend. Lasting freshness and just brushed feeling after using."
5.00,"I was happy to try this toothpaste and just as happy with the results. I liked the taste and it seemed to do a very good job."
4.00,"This is a great collection of products all designed to work together. The floss is a strip, rather than a string, so it really does glide easily between my teeth. I have gums that are pretty tender, and this product never bothered them once. The mouthwash is alcohol-free, so there was none of the stinging or drying I've gotten with other brands. The toothbrush comes in a medium firmness, which is my only complaint. My dentist told me to avoid anything but a soft brush, so I've been a little paranoid about using this one very much. I really do like the increased texture of the tongue-scraping pad, though. Lastly, there is a great tube of toothpaste. Honestly, this was my favorite part of the package. It says the flavor is \"Cool Peppermint.\" What it most closely resembles to me is Altoids. Yes, the curiously strong mints. This flavor really blew me away. It seemed to last a good while for me, too. As other reviewers mentioned, it might be best to pick and choose the components on this bundle for yourself, but really as long as you're okay with a medium firmness brush, this is a great deal."
4.00,"More than one dental hygienist have told me that toothpastes have very little effect on your teeth and gums. It's mostly the mechanical action of brushing to remove loose plaques which does the job. Flouride seems to work though to avert cavities. This Crest Pro-Health toothpaste makes lots of claims for health but I suspect they would not stand up in a rigorous test. Some whiteners actually cause gum tenderness, this has happened to me and my hygienist reports that this is common. We all like toothpaste though because it feels good in the mouth and \"freshens the breath\". This Crest is by far the best tasting paste I can remember using. But when it is used up I'll go back to generic with fluoride."
4.00,"I loved this product. I have used Crest since I was a kid and feel that this product continues the high standards of Crest."
5.00,"I really like crest pro health toothpaste. It made my mouth feel fresh and clean and is the only toothpaste I use now."
5.00,"i used it for the first time yesterday, kept my mouth feeling refreshed and clean for along time, love the flavor"
1.00,"Worst dental product I've ever used. I lost my sense of taste after using this and my mouth and tongue feel weird and as if that wasn't enough, it foams in my mouth for about 15minutes after use. Stay away from this product!"
4.00,"The crest toothpaste was something different to try, but it wasn't completely impressive. I liked how it made my teeth feel and enjoyed that it protected my teeth too. Not sure if the product is worth the full price. I shared with my husband and he really liked the way the toothpaste made his teeth feel. He currently has braces and said it seemed like his teeth were cleaner with the new crest than with other toothpastes. Overall, its a quality product, but not sure if its impressive or worth the total cost of the item. I enjoyed learning about the product and trying it out. I'm not sure if I will switch from my favorite toothpaste, but it is a different and clean feeling."
4.00,"Our family only uses Crest toothpaste and we love it. We've tried another major brand but keep going back to Crest. It really cleans your teeth and helps them stay white."
5.00,"It's a good crest clean. My 18 year old son does not like the taste, but I don't think its bad at all."
5.00,"I have used Crest for years. I have tartar issues and it seems to be the only toothpaste that limits it. The clinical toothpaste worked amazingly well. Great flavor, cleans great, left my mouth refreshed and clean feeling."
5.00,"I really like Crest products. This toothpaste left my mouth feeling clean."
5.00,"This collection is great. The products are useful, and the quality is equal to, or better, than comparable products on the market. I find the flavor pleasing, and using this twice daily is no hardship at all. I'm taking care of my teeth, and believe that I'll keep the teeth I have much longer because of using these products."
4.00,"This product is pretty good and leaves a feeling of cleanliness."
4.00,"I'm not sure about the claims Crest makes regarding gum health, I suspect it would take a couple of precisely spaced very focused dental exams to even try to confirm or deny. I will say that my wife and I have been using a Crest Pro-Health formula for awhile after a dentist recommended it and we both like it. This Pro-Health Gum Protection formula is similar to the rest of the Pro-Health line, though the flavor may be even stronger. Not sure if it's my imagination, but it is really strong - I wish the flavor was a bit more mild. Overall, however, I suspect this is as good a choice as any for your toothpaste needs. Try it."
5.00,"My mouth felt fresh for hours after using Crest Pro-Health toothpaste."
5.00,"I liked the taste better than the original Pro-Health"
1.00,"You have to change this cap. Once it is opened it will not close unless you do what one reviewer suggested and that is slam it on the bathroom counter which I refuse to do - there are too many other toothpastes out there that open and close with ease. I have always used Crest and will continue to do so, just not the ones with caps like Crest Pro-Health Whitening."
1.00,"This toothpaste, along with others that contain similar ingredients, was causing canker sores in my mouth and a bad allergic reaction in my inner lip, including stripping the lining. Presumably, this is due to the triclosan, which can react with chlorine to produce chloroform, a toxic chemical. Ridiculous."
4.00,"The mouthwash has a great taste and it makes my breath smell fresh. It doesn't burn as bad as other mouthwashes, but still you can feel a tingle. The only drwback is that I don't like the coating it leaves on my tongue after use."
4.00,"Teeth feel really clean, like I was just at the dentist."
5.00,"I know this is the best toothpaste for those of us over 40! It helps with all the critical areas we need to be concerned about for great teeth health! Thanks!!"
3.00,"Very good cleaning power. Teeth were nice and smooth, but I would have liked a more powerful flavor. A little zing of freshness."
4.00,"This toothpaste made my teeth clean and fresh. The fresh feeling lasted really well from brushing to brushing."
4.00,"My teeth felt very clean and smooth, just like I had them cleaned at the dentists office."
5.00,"Love this rinse. Can feel it working and leaves my mouth feeling clean and fresh"
4.00,"I definitely noticed that my teeth felt smooth and fresh after using this toothpaste and I will buy it again."
5.00,"I have always preferred Crest toothpaste. I especially like using the Pro-Health with my SpinBrush! My teeth have never felt so clean!"
5.00,"I really love this rinse. I work 12 hour days, and my mouth feels fresher longer than normally. I definitely recommend this rinse to anyone who hasn't tried it."
5.00,"I love this toothpaste,it does make my teeth feel \" just left the dentist\" clean!"
5.00,"My teeth felt cleaner after using this... My breath was fresher longer.... My teeth whiter after just a week! Awesome!"
5.00,"Teeth felt cleaner. It seemed to help them feel cleaner for a longer time also."
5.00,"My best friend is in his final year as a dental student.  He recommended to me these following products:                                                                     1.  Crest Pro-Health Whitening Toothpaste, 4.2-Ounce Carton (Pack of 6),                                              2.  ACT Restoring Mouthwash, Cool Splash Mint, 18-Ounce Bottle (Pack of 4)                                              3.  Crest Pro-health Multi-Protection Alcohol Free Clear/Clean Mint, 1-liter Bottles (Pack of 3).                                              4.  Reach unwaxed dental floss by Johnson &amp; Johnson                                              5.  Oral-B Triumph Professional Care Electric Toothbrush.                                                                     This is the regiment he advised me to follow:                                              1. Use the toothpaste morning and evening.                                              2. Use the Act mouthwash in the morning because it has a really potent amount of fluoride in it and it's the best time of day for using fluoride.                                              3. Use the Crest mouthwash at night because it has a protective film it leaves on your teeth to prevent plaque from building at night.                                              4. Use the Un Waxed floss once per day at night prior to the mouthwash.  The un waxed floss scrubs the teeth way better than waxed floss and especially better than Glide.  The reason is the Glide \"glides\" right past the plaque and food build up leaving the teeth unclean.  The un waxed floss is not for the faint of heart and will take a few weeks to get used to.  It is harder to use because it \"grips\" the teeth and you do have to use a sawing left to right motion to get it between some close teeth.  But, it's way worth the effort.  After months of using the un waxed, I don't even think about it!                                              5. I used to use the Sonicare for years but my friend convinced me that the Oral-B Triumph cleans better and it does if you do the research.  This model also has a handy 4 stage 30 second prompt so you don't have to wonder \"did I brush good enough\". It tells you when you are done!                                                                     CONCLUSION:  My dentist friend says that if you follow this routine, you will probably never have a cavity again!                                                                     I have read a lot of criticism about some of the products on this list but, they seem to be from people who have poor dental hygiene.  I use the tooth paste with the electric toothbrush on high and have had no problems whatever.  My teeth are clean and gums healthy.  Once you get through \"the tunnel\" using this type of regiment, your gums will never bleed and you will have great oral care!                                                                     I wish you happy, healthy teeth!"
5.00,"The Crest Pro Health products leave your mouth and breath feeling fresh and clean for hours. I always look for products that not only clean your teeth but protect them during ones busy day. I highly recommend this line of products to everyone for a clean, fresh and protective teeth feeling."
5.00,"Makes your teeth clean and your mouth fresh and healthy!"
4.00,"you will feel the difference immediately by the smoothness it leaves behind; eventually leading to all the plaque disappearing"
5.00,"I loved it. It left a great taste in my mouth and my teeth felt very smooth and clean."
5.00,"I absolutely love this product. My teeth never felt so clean and smooth. Good way to fight the plaque!"
5.00,"I loved the flavor of the pro-health toothpaste... it works really well too!"
1.00,"I've read other stories of people brushing with Crest Pro-Health and suffering from \"slime\" or flecks of skin peeling away from their cheeks and lips. It definitely is caused by the Crest Pro Health toothpaste and it's amazing the FDA allows products like this to be sold in the U.S.The same thing happened to me about a year ago after my dentist's hygienist gave me a free trial tube of this junky toothpaste. The skin on the inside of my mouth just began to peel off in little pieces, sort of like scalded milk. I gave that sample to a friend figuring it was just me reacting -- but the same oral skin peeling nonsense happened to him as well.Everyone should toss Crest Pro-Health into the garbage and ask for a refund.By the way, there were many other negative reviews on Amazon concerning this effect caused by Pro Health toothpaste, but they have all been mysteriously removed. Very strange."
5.00,"This is my favourite toothpaste. Isn't that crazy, to have a favourite toothpaste? Anyway, my mouth feels really fresh for longer when use this. Couldn't find any at my local store so decided to get some from Amazon."
5.00,"It may slightly defeat the purpose of brushing, but I tend to have hot tea pretty regularly throughout the day and some toothpastes just seem to linger for an hour, even longer and then alter the taste of my tea. This Crest Pro-Health Mint flavor doesn't hover on the tongue to create that problem, which I appreciate. Despite this, I feel like the products cleans well, and appreciate that it doesn't tingle overly much because I don't need that sensation to feel toothpaste or mouthwash works. So far, I haven't experienced an issue with the toothpaste, but I haven't yet emptied the tube though I have used it for a sustained period of time. If something changes, I will report back. It is worthwhile to note that I don't have any sensitivities or allergies."
3.00,"That clean feeling didnt last all day. I also noticed an after taste I dont experience with my regular toothpaste."
5.00,"It takes a little getting used to in the first week, but it's absolutely the best thing if you suffer from gum disease.  If you have gingivitis, use it to prevent more serious gum problems (periodontal disease).                                              I swear by this product, my first review ever, this is how strongly I feel about it.  After four weeks of use, my gums feel and look healthier and I only use it once a day (before bedtime).  The other two times a day I use Sensoyne Pro-Enamel or Colgate Total.  I use an electric tooth-brush now as well.                                              Of-course, NEVER go a day without flossing and visit your dentist at least once a year.                                              If you don't have gum problems, consider yourself lucky and wealthier.  Keep up your oral hygiene for a healthier you! :)"
5.00,"IT WAS AMAZING HOW IT FELT, TEETH FELT CLEAN MOST OF THE DAY."
4.00,"Love getting samples and trying new things. This was a great product."
5.00,"This is one of my favorite toothpastes. My teeth felt so clean and I felt like I had clean breath."
5.00,"I've always been a user of Crest products, but in the past, I'd use whatever toothpaste was on sale because they all worked the same. Once I tried Pro Health, that all changed. When I brush my teeth, they actually feel cleaner than they did before. I don't think I'll ever go back to using another toothpaste again!"
5.00,"I really liked the clean feeling that I was left with after using this product - I highly recommend it to others."
5.00,"I love this tooth paste, and wouldn't change my brand! it leaves my teeth healthy and clean!!!"
1.00,"I bought this last Sunday thinking it would help with plaque and looked pretty good. Today my tongue is burning like I scolded it on very hot food. I'm glad I thought to check the reviews! Luckily I didn't take it for too long, so hopefully the pain won't last long! But this is a horrendous product! Don't buy it!!!"
4.00,"Love this product! Feels very clean after use and left me having fresh breath for a while!"
5.00,"My teeth felt fresh and clean after using this. I would definitely recommend it."
3.00,"I like this toothpaste, but don't know if I'll continue to use it since it costs significantly more than regular toothpaste."
5.00,"The Crest Pro-Health product line leaves my mouth fresh and my teeth squeaky clean. This is actually the way they feel after seeing the dentist. The products are effective while still being gentle enough for my sensitive teeth and gums."
5.00,"This was an excellent product.I will be buying it for myself and family.It left your mouth feeling fresh and clean.Another wonderful product from the 'CREST' family.This works well and is a good vaule."
4.00,"This product does wonders for your teeth and mouth. Although i am not fond of the taste."
1.00,"I purchased 2 tubes with the impression that I would be getting a miracle toothpaste that would not only help my sensitive teeth, but a whole host of other tooth issues (cavities, tartar, gingivitis, etc., etc.) The tip of my tongue is still numb as are the inside of my lips. The top of my mouth feels raw. I found the box to investigate what ingredients may be causal to my 'pain' and noticed it has titanian dioxide, a possible carcinogin. I'll be returning to my tried and true sensitivity toothpaste and tossing this tube."
1.00,"I am a loyal Crest user but this product is just ridiculous. My tongue feels like it has been chafed with sandpaper, when I rinse I spit out blue flecks that also adhere to my tongue (which I then need to brush! AFTER a mouth rinse!?). I have also experienced staining, like so many other reviewers state. Crest, I'm so disappointed in you. I've been searching endlessly for a less intense mouthwash with all the effects of Pro-Health, but this isn't it."
1.00,"Overall this product was a huge disappointment. First the price is very high for the amount of product you get. Second the taste is terrible. It mostly tastes like peroxide and after trying it once my husband and children refuse to use it anymore. I am going to finish the bottle because I don't want to waste it but I will definitely not repurchase it."
5.00,"The mouthwash keeps your mouth feeling cleaner longer. We'll be loyal users!"
1.00,"Just as many others have shared, I too experienced the issues w/ skin shedding or sloughing off the inside of my mouth. While researching the symptoms, I ran across many discussion threads on the same issue - people were citing the same symptoms I had been experiencing and linking the symptoms to Crest Pro Health. Last night I brushed w/ a different toothpaste and, for the 1st time in months, had no skin sloughing after. The onset of the symptoms corresponded w/ my having started using Crest Pro Health some months ago. I had been using Sensodyne but, in an attempt to cut costs, had switched to Crest Pro Health. This is not a new issue. So far I've discovered posts and discussion on this issue dating back to 2007. Ergo, this has been a known issue for a minimum of 3 years. No doubt the makers of Crest Pro Health (Proctor & Gamble) are fully aware of the adverse reactions consumers are experiencing w/ this product."
5.00,"my family loved using the sample of toothpaste and we plan to use it now as our toopaste"
3.00,"This is a great product. It leaves your mouth feeling really clean."
4.00,"I have obtained very good results with its use, my gums have improved, as the overall health of my teeth. A taste that love."
5.00,"I love the fresh taste and how clean it makes my teeth"
1.00,"I was so frustrated about what was causing my teeth to stain and today I found out that this piece of sh!t is causing this. Godd@amn! I wanna r@pe who ever created this crap! Negative 5 stars for sure."
5.00,"It's hard to find a mouth wash that cleans but doesn't sting. Crest however has done just that. My teeth feel clean and healthy without a five alarm fire in my mouth. It also doesn't have that stringent alcohol taste but a nice light minty feel. Great all around product!"
5.00,"My teeth feel so clean, like u just left the dentist office, would buy again."
5.00,"The taste was very nice and the freshness lasted a long time."
4.00,"Let's face it - most mouthwashes have the same ingredients unless you want whitening agents added. I've tried a few of the Crest Pro-Health rinses since I'm looking for one with a taste I can stand and one that doesn't have alcohol as the base since that dries out my mouth. My wife also worries about me rinsing with an Alcohol-based mouthwash, stepping out the door and driving to work with the smell of alcohol on my breath. I don't know if this is true or just something cops tell you but her dad, a retired cop, swears on a stack of Bibles that you can blow a positive breathylizer test for \"being under the influence\" if you get stopped within 20 minutes of a good, long rinse and spit. That could be garbage science but it worries her so we've been checking out the Crest Pro-Health line which has advertised itself as being alcohol-free. I tried the Crest Pro-Health Clinical Deep Clean Mint Mouthwash 473 Ml but that had Hydrogen Peroxide in it, tasted like crap and required an extra step of rinsing your mouth with water afterwards. There are some reviews on that page that explain why that is necessary so I won't go into them here. It was Alcohol-free but I don't need all those ingredients. If I want to rinse with Hydrogen Peroxide, I'll follow my Dentist's advice and do it once a week as a separate rinse and then finish up by rinsing with plain water to prevent the H2O2 from hanging around. I moved on toCrest Pro-Health Invigorating Clean Mint Mouthwash 500 Ml (Pack of 2) and while that was more of what I needed, the taste was not to my liking. it tasted a little too sweet and more like Spearmint AND had Alcohol in it to boot, which was a surprise since most of the Pro-Health line is Alcohol Free. I wound up giving that bottle to my wife to use on weekends. Also, my toothpaste leans towards the peppermint side of things so the Clean Mint clashed with the taste of my toothpaste. I guess I'm a little uit like Goldilocks cuz I gave Crest ONE MORE TRY and tried THIS VARIETY, the Crest Pro-Health Complete-Fresh Mint-16.9 oz and it is jusssssssst right taste-wise and it's an Alcohol-free formula. It meets my needs perfectly but I worry a little since I see some reviewers are reporting that they are seeing stains on the plaque that has built up in-between their dental cleanings. I'm not sure what's up with THAT but I do wonder if they are rinsing too long or possibly seeing staining from too much flouride. If you drink unfiltered tap water, use flouridated toothpaste AND flouridated mouthwash - it is certainly possible that you will start to stain your teeth. I also wonder if these people are tea drinker or coffee drinkers as well since the triple flouride exposure combined with stains from Tea, Cofeee nd even wine can really be a problem. if you are getting brown stains, Obviously I wouldn't suggest using the product. My water has a filter that removes everything, including the flouride so I have not seen any problems...yet. If I do, I'll report back. My advice is to talk this all over with your dentist and to examine all the sources of Flouride you use or are exposed to since that, in and of itself, can cause staining. Then I would write down or go over with ymy dentist, all the foods and drinks that can cause stains. You may be one of those people that has to use a non-flouride mouth rinse. If all you are looking for is freshness and you're flouride needs have been met, there are several natural brands that can give you the same fresh breath and none of the stains. Best wishes!"
5.00,"I will never use anything besides this Crest Pro-Health Clinical. I love the way it cleans my teeth and refreshes my whole mouth, for a long time. We'll see what the dentist says about the plaque, I go back for a check up soon."
5.00,"This product really works as it is advertised, it leaves you that clean feeling that last hours, I highly ecommend the Crest Pro-health as it works great!"
5.00,"I love brushing with this toothpaste. It thoroughly scrubs the teeth and feel so smooth and clean afterwards. I'd definitely recommend this product."
1.00,"This product creates mild to severe allergic reactions in many though not all people. My reaction has been quite painful. After a few days of using it your mouth feels as though you have chemical burns on your tongue, gums, and cheeks. Your tongue swells up and your taste buds become raw. This is not a mouth friendly product."
4.00,"Loved it all most felt like after brushing with it that I had gotten my teeth cleaned at the Dentist!"
4.00,"I like the toothpaste but would like it to get more foamy in the mouth."
5.00,"This is the only toothpaste my husband will use, and after trying it now I see why! I won't use any other brand either!"
5.00,"makes my breath feel fresh, and for a long portion of the day. helps wash away the germs and make everything feel clean."
5.00,"A number of people have complained about burning, etc. This will happen if you do not follow the directions. The directions are specific: Use twice a day and rinse for 30 seconds after rinsing all the toothpaste out of your mouth. This is simply the best mouthwash I have found, but it is not a case of more is better. If you use it more than twice a day or rinse for too long, your mouth will probably burn and that is not a good thing. I have a very sensitive mouth. I cannot even eat food that is too hot. The slightest bit of trauma to the mouth or the wrong toothpaste will result in mouth ulcers. However, I have found this mouthwash causes no problems at all."
4.00,"Loved the coupons and loved the products. My teeth stayed clean all day. I loved the minty flavor of the tooth paste. Glide floss is the only floss I will ever use again."
5.00,"I really like how my mouth, breath, felt for hours after I used this mouthwash."
5.00,"I love this toothpaste. Makes my mouth feel fresh and clean!!"
3.00,"This is a great product. My mouth feels extremely clean and fresh. I am not used to the less minty mouthwashes and I had to rinse with water after I used it because of the whitening ingredients. Overall, this product is much better than the other leading mouthwash brands. It offers more than just fresh breath ...it fights all those yucky mouth germs and gingivitis.....which makes me want to use it for a more healthy mouth and smile!"
5.00,"Mus husband is normally a Crest user so I let him review this product. He really likes it. He said that his teeth feel cleaner, longer than with his normal Crest products."
5.00,"Just bought this product last week and my son loves it, it really gives you that feeling of clean. The feeling last for hours."
5.00,"The only one I plan on using. It doesn't taste like the medicine cabinet !!!"
4.00,"This is one of those toothpastes that tastes a little bit medicinal. That's not such a bad thing, but the aftertaste does remind you a little bit of after you've rinsed with hydrogen peroxide. The texture is somewhere between a paste and a gel."
5.00,"My dentist even recomends this one and it makes your teeth and mouth feel so clean and fresh"
5.00,"I like how when you wake up in the morning you don't have a yuckie film on your teeth. That has happend to me with other toothpaste its gross."
5.00,"I tried the crest clinical plaque control toothpaste. I have been using crest clinical sensitive for over a year due to sensitivity so I knew I could expect quality. These toothpastes don't disappoint. The promise to control plaque was no lie. My teeth felt clean through lunch and into dinner. I would buy this as it still helps with sensitivity (as do all crest clinical toothpastes). I have even converted my husband who used to be a \"gel only\" guy! LOL"
5.00,"Really helped keep plaque under control between dentist visits and left a much cleaner feeling in my mouth. I would definitely use this again and would recommend this to all my friends."
4.00,"I thought the toothpaste was great. It made my mouth feel fresh and clean. I would recommend it."
5.00,"I love the minty fresh taste that it leaves in my mouth. It seems to stay longer than other toothpastes."
1.00,"The stuff is sick. My wife refuses to kiss me after I brush with it. It seems like it's getting my teeth really clean while brushing but afterward I've got this terrible artificial chemicalish taste in my mouth that takes forever to go away. It makes me really thristy too, and I can't stop drinking water afterward.                                                                     I don't know why I'm still using it. I guess I don't want to have wasted my money.                                                                     NASTY NASTY STUFF."
5.00,"Loved this toothpaste. the flavor was not too strong, but it tasted clean and fresh. After brushing, it left my mouth tasting clean and fresh, even several hours later, my mouth still felt fresh"
4.00,"the tooth paste has a great consistency and kept my teeth looking white after my dental cleaning."
5.00,"I have used Crest for years, this complete does what it says and my teeth look and feel great."
5.00,"I love how clean my mouth now feels. I can't wait until my next check up now"
3.00,"Crest Pro-Health Whitening Fresh Clean Mint Toothpaste does have a fresh mint taste. The box states it uses a polyfluorite system and contains ActivClean Crystals for cleaning. I have been using it for three weeks and have not noticed any real whitening effect. However, if it fights cavities, fights plaque, fights gingivitis, and builds increasing protection against painful sensitivity, as stated on the box, I think it would be a good choice for regular use. As far as the whitening, that remains to be seen."
5.00,"I Love that this wash doesnt burn your mouth, this is a major feature!"
3.00,"A bit too minty for my taste, but toothpaste does a good job of cleaning!"
4.00,"i enjoyed the toothpaste and will purchase this Crest product again."
3.00,"I liked the product and thought it was good, but nothing spectacular or any different then everything else out there."
5.00,"I love the new Crest Clinical line of products. They are my new favorite. They cleaned my teeth great and left my left feeling clean all day. I have definitely found a product I am not willing to give up. Thanks Vocalpoint and Crest!"
5.00,"This has to be my favorite toothpaste so far. It has a nice fresh taste and leaves my teeth feeling smooth and clean"
5.00,"You can't go wrong with the new crest products. After trying this, it's still my #1 brand for oral hygiene."
5.00,"sealed and fresh. arrived on time. teeth feel exceptionally clean. Flip top so you don't loos the cap. Able to use all of the product since it is in a tube. Extra large tube."
5.00,"This product was very good. Easy to use, taste good and good for your oral health."
3.00,"One thing I have learned in my 54 years is that toothpaste is toothpaste. It cleans your teeth and leaves some type, usually minty, flavor to show us that \"yes, indeed!\" our mouths are clean! This product is average, does the job and doesn't break the bank. The taste is fine, consistency fine and ability to clean is also fine. Nothing really stands out. Just be sure to use it three times a day with a good toothbrush and your smile will be a stand out. All in all it performs well and serves its purpose."
5.00,"Only toothpaste I use. Excellent product. Does what it says it does. Highly recommend for oral health and gum care."
4.00,"Crest has been my preferred choice of toothpaste since I was a child, primarily because my father worked at Procter & Gamble for 20 years and it was the only brand we used then. I do believe that this regular usage of Crest during our childhoods was responsible for the remarkably good teeth that my brother and I have enjoyed into our senior years. He has only one cavity, and I have two, plus we have all of our teeth...really. Over the past five years because my gums bleed heavily during the cleaning process, my dentist has encouraged me to try toothpastes made for sensitive teeth; also he is concerned that some of my gums are developing deep pockets. So, I have tried Crest Sensitivity as well as other brands, primarily Arm & Hammer and Sensodyne. The main reason that I have not been happy with any of these toothpastes for sensitive teeth is that they all make me gag. I have been using Pro Health for the past two weeks and have tolerated this toothpaste very well, i.e., it does not make me gag. There are many claims on the box made for this toothpaste: fights cavities, gingivitis, plaque, sensitivity, tartar, and whitening, plus it freshens breath. That is literally a mouthful. I do like the fresh feeling that the toothpaste provides to my mouth, and it does last. The one thing I do not care for is the consistency; it is pretty gooey, even runny, for toothpaste. However, because of my long history of cavity success with Crest, I am going to stay with this toothpaste until my next cleaning in five months and see what my dentist has to say about the state of my gums."
5.00,"This toothpaste left my teeth feeling smooth and clean like I had just been to the dentist. I will definitely plan to use it again."
5.00,"I like the taste and the feeling of clean teeth and mouth The clean feeling lasted much longer than most other toothpastes I have tried. I truly felt like my teeth and mouth were cleaner. Definitely worth a try!"
5.00,"I enjoyed the fresh mouth feeling after using this toothpaste, and my teeth do seem whiter. I would buy it after using the sample."
5.00,"I really like this Crest toothpaste. I have always used Crest but this one is really good. My mouth feels really clean."
4.00,"Crest Pro Health sample left my mouth feeling clean, smooth, and refreshed. Using it for a longer period of time will hopefully keep my mouth and teeth healthy."
5.00,"I love the fresh, clean feeling this left behind! My teeth also feel clean long after I'm done rinsing."
5.00,"Loved the packaging...less mess when kids use the tube. Tastes great (kids also enjoy)Like the added benefit of tartar control."
4.00,"I liked the product, seemed alot like the other toothpastes in this product line."
3.00,"The crest pro clinical was a serviceable paste but I still prefer 3d white."
1.00,"Horrible aftertaste that leaves mouth feeling not-so-clean and fresh as if I want to brush again with something else. Worse, slimy white mucus-like stuff collects on teeth and tongue after use. I'm a longtime Crest user but the ProHealth and Crest flavored with cinnamon (the Fresh Burst?) both cause unfavorable reactions, and Internet searches show I'm not alone. (I am allergic to the cinnamon oil, which causes a burning sensation on my tongue.) Will never buy/try the ProHealth again."
4.00,"I tried this product for the first time and felt that it was a decent value. My mouth felt clean for a good amount of time afterwards, but I felt that the mouthwash left a bit of a film."
1.00,"Although this toothpaste is billed as treating sensitive teeth, it lacks the key ingredient to do so. Any true sensitive teeth toothpaste, such as Sensodyne, Colgate Sensitive, etc. contain potassium nitrate, typically at a 5% concentration. Potassium nitrate is the best way to mitigate tooth sensitivity (although some report benefits from potassium chloride or potassium citrate as well). Fluoride alone is far less effective. This version of Crest only has one active ingredient - stannous fluoride. It will not help with sensitive teeth to nearly the degree as a true sensitive teeth toothpaste will. On the plus side, it has a nice taste - very fresh and minty. However, the taste is way too strong, to the point where it's almost overwhelming. I also found the texture to be somewhat off-putting in that it's rather gritty. Although it's marketed (and boasts right on the package) that it's for sensitive teeth, it is not effective for that. I'll give it 2 stars since it seems to be fine as a regular toothpaste, albeit too strongly flavored for me."
5.00,"I thought the toothpaste was great. It made my teeth feel clean, almost as good as what you feel after the hygenist cleans your teeth. I would use it again for sure."
5.00,"I love Crest products! They aren't always necessarily the cheapest, but they are worth the extra money. This toothpaste cleans your teeth, and has a refreshing feeling after. :)"
4.00,"The Crest Pro-Health Clinical Plaque Control seems to do what the title says. I have had a problem with plaque most of my life and it seems to keep it under control for the day when other brands have left me self-conscious after a few hours. I would recommend the product, but know that you get what you pay for - and you'll likely pay more for this product than other tubes of toothpaste."
5.00,"Toothpaste gets teeth very clean. I would buy it again."
5.00,"Crest Pro-Health Clinical Plaque Control toothpaste gave my mouth an awesome clean feeling! The paste has a little bit of a gritty feel, letting me know it was polishing and cleaning my teeth as I brushed. It has a stronger minty taste, which I like, and kept my breath fresh after brushing. My teeth felt cleaner longer after brushing. The price is more than what I'd like to pay for toothpaste, and it did deliver on it's cleaning."
5.00,"I am a lifetime user of Crest products, and these new products are up to the same standards they have always had. My family will continue to use their products."
4.00,"I loved the feel of my mouth after using this. I wasn't afraid of having bad breath. Clean feeling"
1.00,"This should be negative stars!                           This is worse than a waste of money! It is horrific that a company creates a product that should benefit your teeth and it actually damages them.                           My hygienist looked at my teeth today and commented on how badly they are stained. With no comment from me, she asked if I was using Crest ProHealth. Apparently most people who use it end up with badly stained teeth.                           I am thoroughly disgusted. I've contacted Crest for a refund on the two tubes I bought. I will never use there products again. This is not a trustworthy company."
4.00,"I found this toothpaste left my mouth feeling very clean not only immediately but for hours after being brushed."
5.00,"Tastes Great, leaves My mouth feeling fresh!! I use this everyday."
5.00,"Set these up as a subscription by filtering any items your order and then filter it to show only subscriptions. After you add6 every month it takes off an additional 15% which is awesome. I have most of my toiletries show up on my door step monthly and don't even have to leave the house."
5.00,"I like the taste of this toothpaste and how clean my teeth feel for hours after using it...This is a keeper."
4.00,"I've been using this product for several months and have been very happy with it. I can't verify the claims of healthier gums and teeth, but it does freshen my breath and my teeth, while not noticably whiter, they aren't going backwards. It's hard to get excited about toothpaste, but I do plan on continuing to buy it for my family."
5.00,"I have been using Crest Pro Health for a long time and I have healthy gums and teeth. At my last dental appointment I had no cavities. My oldest son is a dentist and approves of me using this product."
5.00,"I love this toothpaste. It's refreshing, does an excellent job of cleaning, yet it's gentle. Sometimes by teeth are sensitive but with this toothpaste, I don't have an issues. I love that it tastes so cool and refreshing without that stinging feeling on my teeth."
5.00,"This is a great product which doesn't leave a strong or bad taste in your mouth afterwards. My mouth feels really clean after using it."
4.00,"I really enjoyed trying this product. Crest pro-health works great."
4.00,"Not only does it make my teeth white and sparkling, it does a great job of cleaning between my teeth, great breath, making my teeth smooth and clean. I enjoy the way it bubbles in my mouth. It has a good flavor. I would highly recommed this product."
5.00,"I was happy with the results of using these products. My teeth looked and felt clean as if I had just been to the dentist. These are the only teeth I have and I want to keep them, so, it is important to me to keep them clean."
4.00,"It gave my mouth a great clean feeling. Definitely will buy again."
5.00,"I loved this toothpaste. Not only did it leave me with long lasting fresh breath but it also left my teeth feeling, literally, squeeky clean."
4.00,"I liked the freshness of the taste while I was using the rinse, it's great that it's alcohol free so it doesn't make your mouth burn. However I had a weird after-taste in my mouth that was almost like.. peroxide-like? I will definitely use the bottle to the end but would probably not buy it again for myself. I would generally recommend this product but would warn about the after-taste."
3.00,"I wouldn't go out of my way to try and find this in the grocery store but it did make my teeth feel clean and fresh, I felt as though they stayed feeling clean a lot longer than usual."
5.00,"Great consistency . I love the feeling and freshness in my teeth"
5.00,"I really liked this tooth paste. It cleans so well!!!"
1.00,"Just tried this product this evening and the after-taste it left was like if someone had sprayed hair spray directly in my mouth - and the worst part is the taste won't go away! I returned it, got a different flavor (the purple stuff) and it was even worse!! Gave some to my roommate to see if it was just me and it wasn't. I can't believe Crest is still selling this. Worst garbage ever!!! Don't they bother to test this stuff before releasing it to the public?Tony"
4.00,"it leaves your mouth feeling clean and refreshed for a long time after using. great to use any time of the day even if you needed to refresh after meals"
3.00,"This edition of Crest Pro-Health for Life toothpaste is billed for those over 50 years of age. I guess that includes me. The things I like about it: 1. It has a big, full-tube-sized flip-up cap with a flat top. That makes it easy to stand the tube on end so it takes up less space on your bathroom vanity. It also helps prevent the lost caps us older folks have to look for when we use the cheaper, warehouse-store alternatives with the old-fashioned screw-on caps. And for the smaller flip caps, those are often held on with a thin, flimsy plastic that allows the cap to break off, and you lose it anyway, after you've used the tube 20 or 30 times and haven't yet squeezed the last few micro-ounces out of it (waste not, want not!). No, really, this is a big, big, flat flip top that's really useful (see note below about one problem with it). 2. It has a pretty aqua-green color that I associate with P&G products like Crest, Zest, and other products from that major branding company. I guess their testing shows that people like that color, and I have to admit I really do. So, that's what I like about this toothpaste. Now on to what I either don't like or what needs a little improvement: 1. Remember that cap I told you about? You have to make a little extra effort to push it closed, otherwise it remains slightly open even while in standing position, and the toothpaste, which is just a little bit runny, oozes out a bit. I know this because my wife doesn't make that extra effort to push the cap closed, and when I get to it I find some toothpaste has oozed out a little and has run out slightly into the flip cap. 2. The flavor is on the sweet side and pretty mild. Not like bubblegum sweet, but something close to it. I like a toothpaste with a bite to it (there must be a pun in there somewhere--I'll revise this later if I can figure it out!). I like a sharper mint (not painful like a Listerine-type mouthwash), probably with some baking soda and peroxide in there to at least make me feel like I have a fresh, squeaky-clean mouth. Many of us 50+ types can use that, whether we realize it or not! 3. The sparkly stuff in the toothpaste that others have written about is probably the whitener part, which is why the paste is a little gritty. The whitener part is fine, but if other 50+ people are like me and have a few crowns in their mouth, what happens when your teeth get whiter but the crowns don't because they've been manufactured to match the yellowish tint of your aging teeth? 4. It doesn't allow a good, fresh gargle, which is related to the flavor/bite comments in negative point 2, above. I like a good fresh gargle and would rather not have to pull out a bottle of mouthwash to get that feeling."
5.00,"This product leaves your mouth feeling refreshingly clean."
4.00,"I like that this product left the clean feeling even after I brushed! It lasted for hours and wasn't alcoholly! I recommended to all my friends!! This product will be one I will use from now on!"
5.00,"It is the best toopaste ever made !! My family and I love it."
5.00,"Not sure what the people here are complaining about. I've been using this for a long time and I've had no loss of taste at all.People say that this causes some brown stains on your teeth. If you have ever used an anti-gingivitis rinse you like chlorhexidine gluconate you know that these rinses causes brown stains because of their gum disease fighting chemicals. So I actually think thats a good thing. Not the staining but the other thing. I usually use this once a day in the morning before brushing my teeth so maybe thats why I dont see the stains as much. But I love that there is no burn and no alcohol. Its got a nice fresh minty taste but not excessively so like Listerine."
5.00,"This is my favorite toothpaste. My teeth and gums feel so clean and healthy after using it. My husband has a problem with swollen gums (nothing wrong though) so the dentist recommended this product and it has reduced the swelling on his gums. My teeth feel clean all day even after eating and drinking. I am a huge fan of crest toothpaste and this is by far my favorite its the only one I buy now! I would recommend this product to anyone!"
5.00,"I recently tried this product and I love it! It makes my teeth feel clean and I have noticed they are whiter and shinier."
3.00,"Crest is always a product that is dependable and one can rely on."
5.00,"I have to say I really like this toothpaste and it has helped my gingivitis significantly.  Some peeling of the oral mucosa, sure, but this is neither painful nor harmful.  I believe this is due to the fluoride as perio-med fluoride rinse has the same effect."
5.00,"The Crest Complete line is great for improving overall oral health. I think using Crest products has reduced the number of cavities that I have and has reduced the likelihood that I will suffer from gingivitis."
5.00,"I really like this toothpaste and I felt like I just came back from my dental cleaning after using this product. If you want that \"dental fresh cleaning\" feeling, then I would suggest using this Crest Pro Health Plaque Control toothpaste...it is that good!"
5.00,"I'm very picky about my teeth. I just don't feel right if I don't feel they are clean. This product helps me feel confident my teeth are protected."
4.00,"Did a good enough job, I just wasn't complete keen on the taste."
5.00,"I love this toothpaste! I got the plaque control, and it leaves my mouth feeling completely clean. I recommend it to anyone!!"
5.00,"I really liked this toothpaste. My teeth felt so clean and I love that feeling."
5.00,"I wanted to wait to review this product until I had my dentist clean my teeth. Well...this product is better than I ever could have hoped. The feeling you get from a professional cleaning lasts and lasts. Definitely worth it!"
4.00,"The taste is smooth and not strong at the beginning. It gradually intensifies in your mouth, not to much. It does leave your mouth refreshed and minty for a long time. This could be a problem if you intend to still drink coffee like me or something else. As I drank my coffee I could still taste the mouthwash. If don't intend to eat and drink, then you will a refreshed mouth for awhile."
5.00,"My family struggled with bad breath for a while. It got so bad using other toothpastes that I drove the car with windows open. This toothpaste took care of all the problems, and as a bonus, tastes great and refreshing as well. I'm sold...especially with subscribe and save discounts."
5.00,"I really like this toothpaste. It left my breath smelling fresh and teeth feeling smooth. It has also helped 'discourage' plaque from forming - esp. on my kid's teeth. Highly recommend this product!"
5.00,"I love that there's so many different varieties available for needs that previously hadn't been met. Made my teeth clean, and my breath great!"
5.00,"I really liked this toothpaste. Made my mouth fresh and clean without being so minty that it was overpowering. I I have sensitive teeth and this did not make me cringe at all. Love it"
5.00,"The toothpaste made my teeth look whiter and feel so clean. I would recommend it to anyone who wants their teeth whiter."
4.00,"This toothpaste was pleasant to the taste and also helped with cold sensitvity. The one drawback for me was it seemed like there was a film on my teeth after brushing. All and all I will use Crest Pro Health Toothpaste"
5.00,"Love the way my teeth felt after using the Pro Health Clinical toothpaste!"
4.00,"Crest really out did itself with this mouthwash, my mouth felt fresh and clean and there was no burning or stinging associated with it. My seven year old even liked it! My only complaint was the flavor, it could have been better."
4.00,"It works well, but I feel like it doesn't do anything that different from other mouth washes."
4.00,"I got this toothpaste because I fit the profile it is designed for and I figured it was worth a try. The flavor is very light, so it doesn't taste like mint candy as some toothpastes do and it actually cleans my teeth very well. I occasionally have sensitivity to cold and that seems to have been ameliorated after just a couple of weeks. A toothpaste that does what it says it will do on the packaging is always worthwhile. This paste does what it says it will do and does it well. Recommended."
4.00,"Toothpaste leaves your breath minty and fresh after every brush. A very good taste, too."
5.00,"I purchased Crest Pro Clinical mouthwash and I have used it every day for 2 weeks. It is very effective, leaves your mouth feeling clean, and most of all excellent at removing and preventing plaque. Oh and my breath has never smelled fresher. I will be buying this product in the future and recommending it to all of my friends and family."
5.00,"I really like this rinse. I provides long lasting freshness without the burn and sting of others on market. I use it twice a day, and bought a small sample sized bottle to keep in my purse. I recommend to all without reservation!"
5.00,"I really liked the Crest Pro Health Clinical Mouth Rinse. Most Rise burns my mouth but this did not. I even let my sister try it out and she liked it too which is a compliment since she is a dental hygienist and is hard to please. She said it made her mouth fresh for a while! That is what I noticed as well! The freshness lasted!! I will use it again!!"
1.00,"!BROWN STAINING! Started using CrestProHealth months ago. I began to notice embarrassing brown build-up. Couldn't wait to go for regular 6mos dental cleaning. The hygienist noticed the unusual staining too...and asked me (initiated the question-) if I was using Crest Pro Health rinse!?! I then replied yes. We'll never buy ANY Crest products again!"
4.00,"I have very sensitive gums, so this was nice because it was refreshing without the burn effect. Also I'm really glad it didn't have any whitening agents in it like so many others...my gums can't handle the whitening agents!"
1.00,"Purchased this item despite negative reviews and I am so sorry I didn't listen! I used this twice and not only does it burn when used but it left a white film all over my tongue and gums which couldn't be removed even after rinsing with water. The next day after using I broke out with blisters in 3 places in my mouth. I will be returning this product. I do not recommend it at all!"
5.00,"The Crest Pro-Health Clinical Plaque Control toothpaste is great! I found that it is far superior to any I've used before. This keeps plaque at bay even when I can't brush on time. That's a huge plus for me. I think it's an excellent product. I liked the taste and the great results I got. Thanks Crest!"
5.00,"Nice clean taste. Excellent teeth whitening tool, makes your breath feel fresh."
5.00,"I Love this product! My teeth never felt cleaner! I'll be a long time user!"
5.00,"Crest has always produced great products and this is another one! It left my teeth feeling very clean and fresh! Thanks Crest!!"
5.00,"I LOVE IT... LOVE IT LOVE IT...LEAVES MY TEETH CLEAN AND I NOW I CAN SMILE LONGER."
5.00,"I have had dental issues for years. Since I began using these products, my time in the chair has been cut in half. My gums don't bleed like before. I am so happy I can't stop smiling!"
4.00,"The crest clinical mouthwash was surprisingly refreshing. It had a different feeling when I was using it, like the liquid was thicker. I didn't care for the taste at first but after I used it the first time and swished and spit, the smoothness of my teeth changed my mind. Plus my breath stayed minty for quite a long time afterwards. After continuously using it for weeks I have to say that this is now our preferred mouthwash in our home. Everyone in our house is using it including our teenagers."
5.00,"I love this toothpaste, it leaves my teeth clean and feeling fresh for a while."
4.00,"I'm new to the Crest Pro-Health rinse, but am anxious to see if I have even less plaque at my next cleaning. Already use Crest pro-health toothpaste, which does a great job at reducing plaque, so with both of these products I should be getting even more plaque reduction. And as I want to avoid gingivitis, which can lead to heart problems if not kept in check, I am following the floss/brushing/rinsing routine. Might be a little pricey and time consuming, but what price can you put on your health (can you tell I'm a nurse??!!). Great taste, no \"burning\" sensation."
5.00,"I thought it had a good taste and left my breath smelling nice"
4.00,"My teeth felt right out of the dentists office clean."
5.00,"The Crest PRO-HEALTH Mouthwash left my mouth feeling clean for hours."
5.00,"I was pleasantly surprised by this mouthwash since I hated the toothpaste so much. This left my mouth feeling fresh & clean without the burning from alcohol based mouthwashes."
4.00,"What I dislike, is the strange mouth-feel after using it. Not so bad at bedtime, but in the morning, it feels like it is dehydrating and makes coffee and breakfast feel and taste funny."
5.00,"i love this toothbrush, it really got in the tough spots and left my teeth so much cleaner than regular toothbrushes! would def recommend to a friend."
5.00,"I love that it doesn't burn and I can actually tolerate swishing around in my mouth for a few seconds. I will buy again."
4.00,"I like that it didn't cause a burning sensation in my mouth. Seems to work well!"
5.00,"I liked this toothpaste and mouthwash a lot it made my mouth feel very clean and made my teeth look whiter and my breath was fresh I would recommend it"
5.00,"My dentist seems to agree that the product works as advertised. Amazing."
5.00,"Crest Pro-Health is my favorite toothpaste. My teeth feel so clean after I use it."
4.00,"We tried the Crest Pro Health toothpaste recently, tasted great and left my mouth feeling fresh! Price about average compared to other name brands. Would recommend to others to try."
5.00,"I love the way it leaves your teeth feeling so nice and clean. Great product."
5.00,"I live with my daughter and her children and bought Crest Pro Health. My granddaughter says that it really works so I tried it and thought that it did make my teeth appear to be whiter. The taste wasn't that good but thought the quality of the product outweighed the bad taste,."
4.00,"Product works well, but not a fan of the taste of it."
4.00,"Great clean feeling and I left with a Smile. Mouth wash was nice but a little pricey."
5.00,"I've using Listerine for years as an antiseptic mouthwash and to help prevent gingivitis. I saw the Crest Pro-Health Multiprotection Clean Mint Rinse available through the Amazon Vine program and selected it. I am pleased with how well the Crest rinse works as it does not burn my mouth when I use it. Listerine used to burn my mouth. I plan to make the switch to Crest Pro-Health and say good-bye to my old friend Listerine. Recommend."
5.00,"With all the germs out there, we need all the protection we can get! This helps rid our mouths of germs and leaves us feeling clean."
4.00,"I am pleased with this product and I like the taste and how it makes my mouth feel after brushing but I am troubled by information on the box which references possible staining of teeth because of the fluoride used. I gave it four stars because it seems to work well but the information makes me wonder if I really should be using this and the information is under an \"Other information\" section rather than a \"warning\" section. The box states under \"Other information\" that \"products containing stannous fluoride may produce surface staining of teeth.\" The information further states that adequate brushing may prevent the stains which are not harmful or permanent and can be removed by a dentist. The box then states \"this Crest is especially formulated to help prevent staining.\" This troubles me. I would hate to have to pay my dentist to remove stains caused by stannous fluoride and I will be talking to my dentist about this product when I see him. This being said I saw a lot of positive things about this fluoride when I searched the web. I know nothing about fluoride. I assumed before I tried this that all toothpaste was the same so I think people need to be aware of what is in this or any toothpaste and check with their dentists to see if it is okay for them to use. As for the product I like the taste and the way it makes my mouth feel. It seems more minty than the Crest Pro Health clean mint flavor which I also reviewed but other than that I am can't see any differences other than this box has Whitening on it in big letters. If it was not for the information I referenced above and how it was listed on the box I would give this five stars."
5.00,"I expected a too-strong toothpaste taste but was pleasantly surprised! It left my teeth feeling very clean and plaque-free for the entire day!"
5.00,"My teeth feel so clean. It really is a great product!"
4.00,"Super clean, sparkling white teeth...a little pricey though"
5.00,"i tried the crest pro health toothpaste and it was great! it left a great clean feeling on my teeth and in my mouth. no nasty aftertaste or \"gunk\" on my teeth. it was great!"
4.00,"The lack of alcohol makes it easier to rinse with. Some light tingling, but not the \"fire\" of previous alcohol based rinses. I would say its comparable in results to other leading brands at maintaining berth freshness."
5.00,"I love this toothpaste. I have been using it for about a year now and I have what I call combination teeth. I suffer from dry mouth and my teeth are really sensative. This toothpaste helps both in addition to the whitining boost. I love Crest!!"
5.00,"I loved the toothpaste. It had a great taste and really cleaned my teeth. Not my usual brand but I will definitely buy it again! Thank you for the sample!"
5.00,"Loved how clean my mouth felt after using this toothpaste. It was like going to the dentist every time I brush. Kept my breathe fresh too."
3.00,"Doesn't customer service get tired of saying 'use the flip top as a twist off'? Really?!? That's all you can say to your customers after several years of poor reviews? Lousy cap on this tube! How sad is it that Crest can't take the time to design a different cap when that's the main complaint about their product. Or do they need everyone to start avoiding their paste altogether in order to make a point. I might just do that even though I have used Crest nearly all of my life and I'm nearly 40."
5.00,"This mouthwash is great!! It is mild enough for my daughter to use. It really cleaned my mouth... without the burn!!"
5.00,"I will buy this again!"
5.00,"Your mouth is full of bacteria. Just like your skin on your hands, the skin in your mouth sheds when dead, damaged, or infected. The mouth heals faster than any other part of your body. That sloughing? dead, infected skin.Sure, some have more sensitive mouths, but for me - this toothpaste has completely maintained my mouth for the last 3 years while saving for dental work that was deemed 'crucial'.My cavity has not become decayed. My gingivitis is 100% healed and gone without a periodontal RX, I have not had a single abscess or cold sore since I began using it, I have not had a single infected salivary gland since I began using it, my gum recession has completely stopped despite having deep pocket plaque.Staining? yeah. My plaque is stained DARK. but my teeth are white, very very white.All in all, it's toothpaste. It's an abrasive detergent. And it happened to save this 28 year old from needing teeth pulled and root canals after being homeless for some time."
5.00,"Great tasting...fresh...leaves teeth feeling like I just got them cleaned."
4.00,"I didn't realize this toothpaste was formulated for people 50+ when I chose it. I recently turned 30, but (alas) I probably have the teeth of a 50-year-old, so I could probably benefit from everything this toothpaste offers. I did feel like it left my teeth very clean, the sort of clean I usually only get from Sensodyne Pronamel. The mint flavor was, in fact, very smooth. One thing I didn't like about this toothpaste was that it is quite gritty, which is the only thing keeping it from 5 stars for me. Overall, I would recommend it, and I do think anyone could use it and benefit from it."
5.00,"I recommend this product. I have a 3.5 year-old son who doesn't watch anything other than Mr. Roger's Neighborhood, so he doesn't know these characters. But he was excited to see pirates on his toothpaste. I like the flip lid for less mess and storage in the medicine cabinet (can stand it up). He seems to like the flavor."
5.00,"Overall cleaning was excellent, the minty taste did not linger quite as long as I would have expected since I use regular Crest. The cleaning aspect of this product is a winner, the taste could use some improvement."
1.00,"I can't taste anything for 24 hours after I use this product. My tongue is really sensitive too. Yuck. I thought about letting my husband try it, but I honestly feel safer just pouring it out."
1.00,"If only I had read the negative reviews before I bought this toothpaste. I received a sample tube from my dentist and like it so I purchased the retail size. After using it for several weeks my lips began to swell and peel. My throat , tongue and gums felt like they were on fire. The only new thing I had come into contact with was this toothpaste. I decided to come here and see other people's comments and was amazed to see many others had similar reactions. I note some of the complaints go back to 2011 so it seems the company has done nothing to remedy this problem."
3.00,"I don't know why everytime I rinse my mouth, then spit it out-purple clumps are in my sink (no matter how much I shake the bottle before using it). For a couple of days I was doing fine then one night when I used the mouthwash I had this awful bitter aftertaste for the whole night. Then in the morning when I brushed my teeth, my tongue felt \"burnt\". You know when you drink/eat something hot and your tongue feels rough and numb. Like that."
1.00,"Terrible will never buy this product again, tasted bad and it must have sand in it very rough on teeth and gums."
1.00,"I haven't had the sloughing problems, but I did actually get a brown stain on one of my CROWNS.  I wondered where in the heck it could have come from.  I was able to scrape it off with my fingernail.  The worst side-effect is horrible breath.  It's really bad when you can't stand your own breath.  I used it because I had a bone graft and wanted to be sure it didn't get infected.  I wasn't able to use my electric toothbrush while it healed and had to use a manual one; not as effective at cleaning."
5.00,"Great products, especially the toothbrush, the design makes it very easy to brush comfortably. We really like the toothpaste mouthwash as well. Great products to use to speed up dentist visits, especially cleanings."
5.00,"I have been using the Pro-Health Clinical Toothpaste for several months and have noticed that my teeth feel cleaner and fresher. I will continue to use it."
5.00,"The toothpaste left my mouth feeling clean and refreshed."
4.00,"I do like Crest products so I was excited to try this kit. While it was handy getting everything in one (mouthwash, toothpaste, floss & a toothbrush), the kit overall was unremarkable EXCEPT the toothbrush - my initial review said the toothbrush was average. I have now come to believe it's just like those commercials where there's an army of tiny people scrubbing your teeth. It feels amazing. Otherwise: These seem to be good but average products, promising whitening (I've noticed no difference) and better mouth health, blah blah blah. The toothpaste is a blue, somewhat gritty gel, a little dry in the mouth, but otherwise no complaints. Mouthwash is effective, not for as long as they promise, but doesn't have a ton of burn to it. The floss is fairly high-quality."
4.00,"My husband and I tried this toothpaste and both of us liked it so much it is now our regular toothpaste. It gets my teeth nice and clean and I really like the way my mouth feels after brushing. I have sensitive teeth and this works great for them."
4.00,"I love the Pro-Health toothpaste. Great product/ But I hate the big fat tube. It is so hard to get the toothpaste out of the tube with that hard plastic opening and the lid attached . Please go back to the normal screw off cap and forget all that hard plastic at the top."
5.00,"i loved it. after using my teeth and mouth felt so clean. my teeth remained smooth and clean feeling all day. i have used several different products and this by far is my favority."
4.00,"This product made my teeth cleaner and stronger, love it"
5.00,"This is definitely the best product on the health and beauty market. It gives a completely fresh feeling. It really did seem as if I had just left the dentist office. Love this Product!!!"
4.00,"Decent product, but will be sticking to my other brand I normally use. Seems a little pricey"
4.00,"As with most Crest products, our family loved this one too! Thanks, Crest for striving to continue to do better and create better products for our family."
5.00,"Saw great results. Will continue to use it as part of my dental regimen"
4.00,"I really do like this paste. It's not overly minty, and it does what it says it will do and that is a long lasting clean feeling. However, it is rather expensive, even more so than some of the other Crest products."
4.00,"I have tried three Crest Pro-health toothpastes. I am pleased with all of them including this product and I like the taste and how they make my mouth feel after brushing (though I liked this this the least of the three) but I am troubled by information on each box which references possible staining of teeth because of the fluoride used. I gave all four stars because they seem to work well but the information makes me wonder if I really should be using them. Further the information is listed on each box under an \"Other information\" section rather than a \"warning\" section but what I read seems like a warning. The boxes state under \"Other information\" that \"products containing stannous fluoride may produce surface staining of teeth.\" The information further states that adequate brushing may prevent the stains which are not harmful or permanent and can be removed by a dentist. The boxes then state \"this Crest is especially formulated to help prevent staining.\" This troubles me. I would hate to have to pay my dentist to remove stains caused by stannous fluoride and I will be talking to my dentist about this product when I see him. This being said I saw a lot of positive things about this fluoride when I searched the web. I know nothing about fluoride. I assumed before I tried this that all toothpaste was the same so I think people need to be aware of what is in this or any toothpaste and check with their dentists to see if it is okay for them to use. I looked at the ingredients on all three boxes and they seem to be the same so I am not sure what makes one better at whitening and another like this one better at gum protection. The box does say this has been clinically proven to remove gingivitis in four weeks. I have tried the Clean Mint, Fresh Clean Mint and Invigorating versions. This had the most flavor--kind of like a very strong mint flavor. The flavor lasted longer in my mouth than the other two and I found this more harsh than the other two. It is my least favorite of the three but flavor is a matter of taste so if you like stronger tasting tooth paste you probably would like this. If it was not for the information I referenced above and how it was listed on the box I would give this five stars."
1.00,"I had no idea why I had to keep getting my teeth cleaned every three months. Thankfully my new dentist asked me what mouth wash I use - which is Crest pro health - because she also told me it causes teeth to turn yellow. She strongly suggested switching to Listerine Zero."
5.00,"I have used similar products but this one works great. I like the taste and consistency and it leaves my mouth feeling clean without an after taste."
2.00,"I gave the mouthwash a try but I hate the taste or aftertaste that you can't get ride of for a good while. If you ever bleached your teeth even with just the whitening strips, it's the same taste that you try to get out of your mouth asap afterwards and not use it as a mouthwash. It might work great for some, but I highly dislike it just because of the taste and won't use it ever again."
4.00,"Although the flavor wasn't the greatest to me, it was very refreshing and left my mouth feeling very clean. Thanks!"
4.00,"I have used Crest for many years and will continue to do so because it is an excellent product. However, I do not recommend it at this time for one reason - the cap. After using the toothpaste a very few times, there is no way to close the tube. Packing it in a suitcase requires wrapping it in a plastic bag because the toothpaste is squeezed out. I hope that you will re-package it in a different container with a cap that will close."
3.00,"This, too me, is an okay product, however, I really wouldn't recommend this. I realize I checked Yes, however, there was no other box listing \"Maybe\". You should have 3 boxes-- yes, no or maybe---- I like the toothpaste I use (Crest Tarter Control) much better been using it for years and have had no problems and the Dentist is pleased with my results also"
5.00,"It makes my mouth feel clean and make me smile to have fresh breath."
4.00,"Leaves teeth feeling clean and refreshed and has a good flavor."
5.00,"Crest Pro-Health toothpaste leaves your mouth feeling fresh, and your breathe smelling great. I would highly recommend this toothpaste."
5.00,"When combined with the oral B tooth brush for older adults I can feel and see the difference using this product. My teeth are whiter and stay clean-feeling longer that they do with the Sensodyne tooth paste I normally use. It provides the same comfort level as Sensodyne but it tastes much better. This is my new toothpaste."
5.00,"Crest has always been known for having great products. This product is no difference. It was all I expected it would be. Great."
1.00,"I have been using this product for about 2 weeks now. I floss twice a day, never smoked, drink water, reagular visits to the dentist, I do what I can to keep my teeth healthly and my teeth look like they are decaying!! With this product staining so many people's teeth, why is Crest Pro Health still on the market!!! I would have not given this product ANY stars if I could!!"
4.00,"My mouth seems to be fresher after using this today along with the tooth brush and mouth rinse"
1.00,"The toothpaste itself is fine for use, but it is very messy. It doesn't stay in the tube and come out neatly. I feel like I waste more on the sink than on my toothbrush."
4.00,"This is a fantastic product. The rinse leaves your mouth feeling fresh and clean. Unlike other mouth wash, it does not burn or irritate your mouth."
5.00,"I used up my sample and already bought a big tube. Love this toothpaste and how it made my teeth feel like I just had my teeth cleaned. It also left a great after taste in my mouth. This is now ky favorite toothpaste!"
5.00,"Honestly the best toothpaste I've ever used. After a few uses, my teeth felt as clean as if I'd just come from the dentist."
5.00,"great tasting, leaves your mouth feeling fresh. but it is a little pricely"
1.00,"My teeth have always been in good shape. Althought not completely white, not yellow. My Dentist told me to use mouthwash with flouride to keep the sugar from eating at my teeth. So I tried this product. Have been using at morning and at night. I have even watched the clock so I was rinsing for 1 minute as the directions dictate. I noticed brown at the side and base around the gum area on one tooth. I'm 52 years old and just thought it was an age thing. But then I see it on 75% of my teeth now. I just searched, \"why are my teeth turning brown\". To my surprise I find all kinds of peole saying the same about this product. I just got done brushing and will poor out the rest of this product. I just had a tooth cleaning 6 months ago. I hope this can be removed. I have been using this product for 8 months. It all seemed to appear with in a one month period."
5.00,"I liked Crest Pro Health a lot. I loved the way it made my teeth feel and the taste it left in my mouth."
5.00,"We really like this mouthwash. It leaves your mouth feeling very fresh and clean!"
5.00,"If you don't like the taste of mint, cinnamon is the way to go. Sometimes it is hard to find in the store, finding a 4pack and having it delivered the next day was a bonus."
5.00,"I absolutely love this toothpaste. With some toothpaste brands I don't feel that my teeth are really as clean as they could be but with Crest Clinical my teeth feel squeaky clean!"
3.00,"the mouthwash is great, it would prefer to have a fresh feeling longer than i do with this like the crest 3D whitening."
5.00,"Loved the fresh clean feeling after brushing. The taste was great and the whole family loved it! I would definitely recommend this product."
5.00,"This Pro Health mouth rinse really works! It's long lasting effects are perfect for morning use - to get you through the day -- or before bed, when germs can multiply and cause damage, even after brushing. I recommend it and so does my dentist."
5.00,"I loved how clean my teeth felt after using this toothpaste!"
4.00,"Very nice product. Has nice tingly clean feeling.."
5.00,"This toothpaste made my teeth feel very clean, and made my breath feel fresh. Will use it again."
5.00,"My teeth feel fresh and clean.I would recommend this product."
4.00,"This is my absolute favorite toothpaste, it really cleans and freshens my breathe at the same time I recommend this to everyone."
5.00,"My husbad and I have always thought Crest was a great toothpaste, but after I recieved my coulons I wwent out to pick this one up and it exccede my expectations. I thought that it left my mouth feeling clean and fresh and definitely lasted. Great toothpaste!! I will definielty be buying this one again. :D"
4.00,"Carol"
4.00,"My teeth felt really clean and the taste was good. However, I am a couponer, in a recession, so I will buy what I have coupons for that are a good price and for what I will actually use. Not sure if the cost of this even with a coupon would be worth it to me if it's not on sale."
1.00,"So I had a sample bottle from my dentist and started using this thinking it was a good idea to add an additional step to my routine. I finished the sample bottle and then bought this one. Then is when I noticed my teeth turning brown! My front teeth and in between are brown spots. It is mortifying. My husband tried it and he said he lost his sense of taste for three days. I am throwing this away. Horrible, horrible stuff. I may need to get to the dentist early to try and get this scraped off. I went to a wedding and was afraid to smile because of how my teeth looked. I am going back to just brushing and flossing and not rinsing!!"
5.00,"When it comes to buying toothpaste don't buy cheap always go with the good stuff like Crest. Crest products really make my teeth feel clean."
1.00,"It does burn even though it's alcohol free, and it's irritating to mouth and gums. I threw it away after using for three days because of a scary reaction to this product. I definitely would not recommend."
5.00,"My dad is the hardest person to get a gift for. I got him crest toothpaste on subscribe and save as a christmas present and he really liked it. a little weird but he was happy."
5.00,"It does what it says it will do. I like the product."
5.00,"Excellent rinse. I could feel the difference it made. Would definitely recommend."
3.00,"Most tubes of toothpaste are over 6oz, so these almost look like travel tubes. Good toothpaste, but I've never seen tubes this size in a store."
5.00,"Refreshing and my family loves it. This product will be on my shopping list."
5.00,"This Crest Pro-Health Rinse Complete Fresh Mint mouthwash is a nice rinse that doesn't give that stinging feeling as do other mouthwashes that contain alcohol. I am losing some of the enamel on my front teeth and I wanted to prevent any further damage, so the Crest Pro-Health Rinse is helping me maintain my enamel. The taste is mild but minty and I like it because the children and I can both use the same mouthwash and that's a plus for our household budget. The bottle stated that there is a possibility of teeth being stained from long periods of usage but none of us have had that unfortunate experience. I love rinsing before and after I brush and The Crest Pro-Health rinse gives my mouth the clean feeling that I love. This is a healthy and complete mouthwash that the entire family can use and will love."
5.00,"This product left my teeth feeling smooth and clean. I didn't have an after taste of residue as some products do. I have told everyone I know about this product."
5.00,"I love the toothpaste. It makes my mouth feel fresh and clean."
3.00,"I DO NOT FEEL THAT THIS TOOTHPASTE DOES ANYTHING MORE THAN THE OTHER CREST TOOTHPASTES I'VE USED."
4.00,"This toothpaste tastes like spearmint, and leaves a refreshing taste in your mouth for about a half an hour or so after you use it. It is a gritty toothpaste, but not so gritty that it feels like you are brushing with sand. My teeth feel clean after using it. I don't know if it can reverse gingivitis, as I'm not sure that any toothpaste has the power to do that. I will see what my dentist says at my next appointment in June. I usually use Sensodyne, because my teeth are really sensitive. This toothpaste claims to help with that as well. I didn't notice that my teeth were more sensitive in using this, so perhaps it is living up to its claims."
5.00,"I was so happy that I was able to find this product on Amazon. I love this product. I find that this tooth paste really helps to control the early morning \"dragon breath\". I can no longer find this toothpaste in the stores. My dentist got me hooked on this prohealth Crest toothpaste. TRY IT"
4.00,"I really enjoyed trying this new toothpaste & I usually don't like the taste of Crest. My teeth, mouth felt fresh after brushing. I will definitely buy."
5.00,"Ive always been a crest user,and the new products are just as wonderful as the past.I love the fact that the toothpaste does what it says.no plaque on my teeth and i love that feeling all day long."
5.00,"I enjoyed using this toothpaste. it really left my teeth feeling like I'd had a professional cleaning."
5.00,"I love this tooth paste. The taste of it is wonderful and my teeth feel so clean afterwards. I haven't used it for a month yet to know if those claims are true, but I'm very happy worth it."
5.00,"I love crest mouth wash, keeps your mouth clean and fresh all day!"
5.00,"this mouthwash left my mouth feeling fresh and clean. Love the tingly feeling!"
5.00,"I like how many dental health areas this product covers. I am pretty picky, but love this product. Thank you!"
4.00,"This is a pretty run-of-the-mill mild mouthwash. Yes, it freshens, but I'm not blown away (and I have been blown away by other brands). It's sweet-tasting but this product is not something that lasts and lasts all day."
5.00,"This is a great toothpaste. Left my mouth feeling clean and fresh! Highly recommend this product."
4.00,"When trying this product.... I loved the clean feeling during, and afterwards! You can tell that the product is really doing it's job... and makes you feel more confident, especially when you work with an office full of patients all day!"
2.00,"It tasted gross and didn't get my teeth any cleaner than normal. Plus it was a bit pricey."
4.00,"This product is very good. I would definitely recommend. Price is little bit more."
4.00,"I have been using this mouth wash over the last two weeks and I have not experienced any of the problems described by anyone else. I believe that the main problem is that some of the other people who are using this do not need clinical strength mouth. Before I started using this I had persisted bad breathe and nothing would help it, mouth wash wise, not even the supposed bad breathe destroying mouth washes. If you have that problem, go for this one; if not, stick with your normal one. Honestly, why world you try this when your normal mouth wash is already doing it's job? People need to stop trolling on products that work perfectly fine for those who actually need them and write reviews on those that pertain to them."
5.00,"I started using this rinse shortly after a dental cleaning and I feel like it really did help to keep my teeth cleaner!"
5.00,"I love that my teeth feel like they just got back from the dentist...With no pain nor the adult bib... :)"
5.00,"One of the last cinnamon toothpastes out there, and it's getting harder and harder to find. But Wal-Mart always has it on the shelf. Love it!"
4.00,"My mouth feels fresh and clean and helping it stay clean.I loved that it was not harsh on my gums. Will definitely recommend to friends.Not sure on the whitening part though"
5.00,"This seems a bit different from other rinses in that it foams a bit, but not too much. Has a good taste, nothing overpowering, but does the job to make a clean mouth feel. I also notice that my teeth have a \"polished\" feel to them after using, and into the next day even. I would recommend this rinse!"
5.00,"My teeth felt like I had just left the dentist's office! So clean and smooth. I will definitely be buying this toothpaste again!"
5.00,"I have been using both the toothpaste and mouthwash for quite a while, and love them both."
5.00,"Left my mouth and teeth feeling so clean! Also, my breath was fresh for a long time!"
5.00,"I've been a fan of the Crest ProHealth line since it came out. I have sensitive teeth and this toothpaste works better than any other brand at helping with the sensitivity. I love the new plaque fighting line as much as I do the other types of Prohealth. Thank you for letting me try you new product!"
4.00,"The toothpaste is the freshest and the best that I have tried so far, but it said it was a package of 2, instead I received only 1."
1.00,"I was shocked when I noticed my lower front teeth had a brown discoloration along the gum line. I thought it was some sort of disease until i searched for this product online and discovered all of the terrible reviews. Also, you will feel like layers of your mouth are being burned off. Maybe thats the weird clumpy stuff that everyone talks about? Don't buy this."
5.00,"The overall usage of this Crest was great! I loved how it made my teeth feel that they were cleaned better than anything else I've tried."
4.00,"Great product. My teeth feel so clean after using this toothpaste. I love the lasting effect of the minty fresh flavor."
5.00,"I just love CREST pro-health!!!! The cool mint flavor tastes great and stays with me and my teeth look whiter and feel cleaner longer then other toothpastes!!!"
4.00,"to be perfectly honest, i will buy whatever toothpaste is the best value at the time i need to purchase a new tube. regardless, i think this is a very nice product and would certainly consider purchasing in the future"
1.00,"I started using this product believing its hype. A slimy whitish substance started coming off my mouth after a few days, but I did not make the connection, since I did not feel any pain or irritation. Then during my next dentist appointment, my oral hygenist told me she was finding more staining problems with my teeth than usual, and she asked me point blank if I was using Crest Pro-Health toothpaste or mouthrinse. I was stunned. She then told me that this product causes severe staining in some patients as in my case, so I stopped using it. Bottom line, consult your dentist or oral hygenist before switching to something that maybe should be sold on a prescription basis and not over the counter."
5.00,"I tried the Crest toothpaste. I loved it! I would only use Crest brand of toothpaste because it leaves a clean feeling and has a great taste."
1.00,"I thought I was the only who was experiencing \"mouth slime,\" but was relieved (and simultaneously horrified) to find that others are reacting the same way to this awful product. This toothpaste claims to whiten teeth and kill germs, but instead it feels like it is eating away at my tongue, cheeks, and lips. When I finish brushing, the inside of my mouth feels bumpy and numb like I've been brushing with acid. Shortly thereafter, the top layer of skin inside my mouth (particularly my inner lips) peels off in a slimy, white layer. If it's already eating away at my skin, just imagine what it's really doing to my teeth! DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!"
4.00,"The product helped my teeth feel clean and smooth and my mouth felt fresh overall."
4.00,"This is a good product. Makes your mouth feel great. It's a little pricey though."
5.00,"I always trust the name crest and now I feel even better after trying crest pro-health toothpaste. I know my mouth and teeth feel clean after using it but to know that I have protection against cavities and am using a great product makes me feel even better. Kids are using it too and really like the fresh taste. Thanks crest! Job well done!"
4.00,"Made my teethe feel clean, my breaht smell great, and whitened. Very pleased."
4.00,"Loved this product!! My teeth feel so clean and really do look more white! Its definitely worth the money. Crest is always amazing!"
4.00,"This toothpaste made my teeth feel extremely clean and fresh."
5.00,"I LOVE this toothpaste. All the products in this line are great, but especially this toothpaste. It is great for sensitive teeth, has a great but not overbearing taste and keeps breath fresh longer than a normal paste. It does the job well without being harsh, a characteristic I really enjoy! Plus, the value for the item is truly there. Job well done on this product!"
5.00,"I have been using Crest toothpastes for over 40 yrs. It was the first toothpaste my dentist as a child told my mom to use and today I am still using it. Now I use the Crest ProHealth series of products for my adult dental hygiene and it is still number one with me. Keeps breath fresh and teeth feeling dentist clean all day."
5.00,"Just had a dental exam, looking forward to the next one after using this product."
5.00,"Good taste with mint and not chalky as many seem to be. I like crest anyway so this combo is great. Save many in multi pack"
5.00,"I purchased the Pro-Health Sensitive Toothpaste as my teeth are very sensitive. I was happily surprised when I loved it! My teeth feel clean after I brush. My teeth have never hurt and the mint is not overpowering...it is very subtle. I will definitely be buying this product again!"
4.00,"This is a good product, I love Crest anyway, but this really made my mouth feel clean and also made my breath clean without smelling so fruity."
4.00,"The taste was clean and fresh. My mouth felt clean and fresh."
2.00,"I've been reading horror stories about Crest Pro-Health products here lately and I've been very scared to continue usage but I still wanted to give it an honest test. I can tell you that after just one time using this product my mouth felt strange. The roof of my mouth and my tongue both had a sliminess to them. They felt how they do when I burn them on food that is too hot. It wasn't painful but it did feel a bit numb and strange. I didn't think this toothpaste tasted bad but I didn't care for the taste either. I know that typically Whitening toothpastes don't usually taste very good to me so on a Whitening level it's probably better than ones that I've used in the past but still, it's not great. After reading numerous reports of people having some serious side effects to using this product line such as skin peeling, staining & blisters I've chosen not to continue using this product. I didn't have these extreme issues but I didn't use it much either. I don't understand how a Whitening toothpaste can cause so many people to experience brown staining on their teeth but there's many reports of this. Knowing how many people have suffered using this product line I can't say I'd recommend Crest Pro-Health to anybody. It's too risky."
4.00,"My teeth were really clean. My breath seemed less \"stale\". It is definatly a keeper!"
1.00,"After using this product once, I noticed a horrible chemical sensation on the tip of my tongue. It wasn't just a taste, I could feel it too. Like licking a battery. (Don't do that). I also noticed what I thought were canker sores on my inside cheeks. In retrospect it could've been a burn. Overall. not a pleasant experience."
3.00,"I really liked the taste of it and the feelings afterwards. It made my breath feel fresh."
4.00,"i was raised on crest. i think we all were. i made my teeth feel clean and fresh."
5.00,"What a great toothpaste! Leaves your teeth and mouth feeling clean and fresh for so long after using!"
5.00,"The product is outstanding and it is what is advertised. It was a little smaller than I expected, but that was on me. I love Crest Night Time toothpaste to help protect my teeth throughout the night. I am a little old fashioned however I still look for the ADA (American Dental Association) mark on toothpaste and this product has it."
4.00,"Love a good mouth rinse, and this one lived up to its promise......gave you an all day fresh feeling"
5.00,"Been using the Clinical gum protection toothpaste and rinse for several weeks now and I love it. Well worth the price. Noticed a real difference in my gum health. Tastes great and leaves your mouth feeling fresh for hours. I did try the toothbrush but was not as impressed by it as the other products but is as good as any other."
5.00,"I love crest and it makes my teeth look pearly white. It makes me want to smile all day long."
1.00,"I've used Listerine's version of this (fluoride, complete care, etc.) for years without any problem. Found this stuff on sale last week and gave it a shot, but am really regretting it. As others have noted, it absolutely ruins your tastebuds/tongue. If you've ever eaten too much acid (too many oranges or something), it feels like that. I tried to eat a fruit salad over the weekend, and could only handle a few bites because my tongue felt like it was on fire.                                                                     Needless to say, I'll never buy this again, and don't recommend that you do."
4.00,"This product makes my teeth and mouth feel clean and bright"
1.00,"For months I couldn't figure out why the skin was peeling off in my mouth. I even asked my dentist and she couldn't figure it out. After reading other Amazon reviews about this product, I realized it was the toothpaste and stopped using it and now my mouth is free of clumps of dead skin! This product needs to be recalled."
5.00,"Alcohol free, and a clean, fresh mouth! It has it all!!"
5.00,"This product made my teeth feel like I had just left the dentist."
1.00,"I tried it for the first time just under an hour ago.  At first there was a weird tingly feeling that hurt, which was odd but I thought it was just the mint flavoring.  Then I got large bumps in my mouth all of the sudden that hurt really bad and my entire mouth is getting really sore.  DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT.  Saw several reviews of similar reactions, beware!!!"
1.00,"Finished a bottle of this before starting to worry that there was something horribly wrong with me or my dental hygiene habits due to the staining on my teeth that was so bad multiple people noticed and told me to see a dentist right away. It took my a while to figure out that this was causing it, because mouthwash is probably the last thing you would expect to stain your teeth. The fact that these people sell oral hygiene products that STAIN YOUR TEETH is absolutely absurd and reprehensible. Never buy this product unless you want your teeth to look like they're rotting. This is literally the worst product I've ever used in my life. It does exactly what it's designed not to do. I'm definitely never buying Crest products again and will probably try to avoid P&G all together just on the principle."
5.00,"I really like this rinse it keeps my mouth clean and fresh. I love it"
5.00,"This mouthwash works great! I love the clean feeling of my mouth for hours after using it. I am a coffee drinker and like to carry a little mouthwash with me to rinse after eating and drinking."
4.00,"I bought the product and was skeptical about it actually working better than any other toothpaste but as it turns out it was actually as good as it was advertised to be."
4.00,"I really liked this toothpaste. It had good flavor that wasn't overpowering. It kept my breath fresh for a long time. I have switched to it."
4.00,"My husband and I used the rinse and he thought it was just like rinsing with diluted hydrogen peroxide. Except I thought it tasted better. We like it. I think it would be a little expensive to buy on a regular basis for us. It may last a while so the price may be worth it. Will have to see how long it lasts. I usually don't use rinses and am not sure that it will influence me to change my habit."
4.00,"Made my mouth feel fresh and wasn't too overwhelming, as mouthwash tends to burn my mouth! With this product I was able to actually keep in my mouth long enough to swoosh it around. I was sold after that!"
5.00,"I really think there is something to this toothpaste. It's pleasant tasting and seems to have really improved my gum health. It promised to fix things in like 3weeks? But it only took a week! I was pregnant when I apparently had gingervitis (my gums were bleeding). Which happens to the best of us. So it was nice having this box put aside that my dentist gave me (and I still didn't' use, just stuck with my colgate). My gums stopped bleeding during brushing and looked much better. Good stuff!"
5.00,"It was a great opportunity to be able to try this product. I will buy this again because it made my teeth feel so refreshed for a long time. It was the best feeling ever."
4.00,"I enjoy this toothpaste for all the benefits it provides, however, not too thrilled that the taste is not very strong and doesn't seem to last very long"
1.00,"The mouthwash was very foamy probably from the hydrogen peroxide in it. It tasted like old toothpaste. I has to rinse and get something to drink to get rid of the aftertaste."
5.00,"I love this toothpaste for two reasons. 1 - it does a great job cleaning my teeth and giving me a fresh feeling in my mouth. 2 - it is not super minty - it is refreshing is the only way I can describe it. Not antiseptic or harsh like other toothpastes. Plus my hygienist says my teeth look great."
4.00,"I love the clinical crest plaque control It leaves my breath feel so fresh."
4.00,"It was good. Nothing particularly special. Something I would buy on sale, but might not specifically seek out."
4.00,"The reason I gave it four stars is that I felt it was a bit pricey."
5.00,"i will buy this toothpaste again as it really cleaned my teeth well...i feel like i just went to the dentist! :)"
4.00,"I would recommend this product to family and friends"
5.00,"For some reason, I can't find this toothpaste where I live in South Florida. I hate minty toothpaste, so for me, this is my preferred brand. Shipped fast, and my teeth are happy again. (They were growing green fuzz.)"
5.00,"Really liked this mouthwash. Will recommend for sure."
5.00,"Best toothpaste that I have ever used! My teeth feel so clean and stay feeling that clean for a long time!"
5.00,"I love this toothpaste - it tastes so good and makes my teeth feel smooth, just like I had a professional cleaning."
4.00,"I was very surprised when I received the sample as this was my first try and tell. Crest never seems to let me down it's always amazing and does exactly what is advertises to do."
5.00,"Teeth and gums felt very clean for a longer period of time after brushing. Would def recommend this produce to my family and friends!"
5.00,"Loved this product- fantastic taste. I highly recommend"
3.00,"As a hygienist I am a Crest fan. I was excited about the new line of Pro-Health products. After trying the toothpaste I was disappointed by the awful aftertaste. In my opinion, there are other Crest toothpastes that leave the same clean feel with a much more pleasant taste."
5.00,"I loved the toothpaste. The mouthwash has a great long lasting taste."
4.00,"I really liked how my teeth felt, so clean! Kind of expensive but our teeth are worth it."
5.00,"Crest came up with a toothpaste that helps to keep your gums healthy. Healthy gums don't get gingivitis or other common disorders. With regular flossing, your gums stay healthy and your smile bright. I love this product."
5.00,"Great rinse. Would definitely buy again! My teeth feel so clean!"
1.00,"This toothpaste has a horrible lingering artificial-sweet aftertaste that lasted hours after I used it.  It made my coffee and bagel taste horrible even a couple hours later.  I won't use it again.  It was a free sample from the dentist.  And reading all the other much scarier comments about it just reinforces that decision."
5.00,"It really gets your teeth clean. Great taste too! I would recommend this to everyone."
1.00,"I've used this product twice now, and already I'm terrified if I should use it again. My sense of taste is almost completely gone from the first half of my tongue, and it feels oddly numb. I don't know what to do about this problem, if its permanent or if it'll go away, but I'll tell you one thing; I'm not using this product ever again."
5.00,"It went beyond the usual clean of other toothpastes...I could feel how clean it made my teeth. Really!"
5.00,"Loved the great product! Great taste, worked fantastically."
1.00,"Used this to help my gums so I could look good for the dentist again. I'm tired of his lectures to brush and floss and rinse more. So I saw the add on tv, boosting to do just that.                                              Used it for a week and ruined my white teeth.                                              I am SO mad. I'm going to return it."
5.00,"I love the taste of this toothpaste, and love that it does everything I need in one product."
5.00,"I purchased the large bottle of this rinse to assure my husband and I would both be able to use it for at least two weeks. After the two week trial, I was delighted to notice that we both had whiter teeth, my husband was not experiencing any tooth pain as normally comes up over the course of a couple of weeks, and I could actuall feel that my teeth were stronger and cleaner! Other rinses have made my mouth minty fresh, however none of them can compare to the truly clean, healthy feeling that you get after using this rinse. Like I said, we used it for a couple of weeks to see if it had true staying power, and it definitely does!!"
5.00,"This is now my new favorite toothpaste!! It makes my teeth feel extra smooth and clean!!"
5.00,"Love it!! have been using the Pro Health line for a while and love that you have added the Plaque too. I use Crest Pro Health exclusively. Thank you!!!"
4.00,"Really enjoyed this toothpaste. The only thing I wasn't exceptionally thrilled over was the lack of \"zing?\" I guess. My teeth felt clean just not super super clean like usual with this brand. Had a dental check up recently and Dentist was happy. SO I would have to say its doing its job."
4.00,"The toothhpaste left a rather nice, clean feel to my mouth. My breath felt fresher after brushing and remained fresh for a long time after"
5.00,"My kids love the taste of this toothpaste. It's easy for them to remember to brush because the taste is so good they look forward to brushing."
1.00,"I, too, have had a terrible experience with this product -- I thought I must have burned my tongue. It hurts, I can't taste anything and what little bit I can taste is metallic. I realized that it is this product and when I came on line to find out if this is a common problem, lo and behold, here it is. What all these consumers are complaining about is exactly what I am experiencing. I will be pouring my rather expensive bottle of blue chemicals down the drain."
1.00,"My GF bought this for me since I was out of my normal wash. I used it once this morning at about 7am. It's now 7pm and I still can't taste anything. I tried eating coffee ice cream for lunch and it was bitter and vile tasting.                                              I can't seem to taste anything sweet, salty or savory, only bitter. This mouthwash is tremendous if you want to lose weight, you'll have no incentive to eat while using it."
5.00,"Works great"
4.00,"I bought this based on the good reviews I read. After using it for 2 weeks. I have to say its pretty average. Its just like any other tooth paste. It has a good taste and lasts pretty good after I brush. Feels like a good clean after brushing. But overall I don't think its anything amazing. The cheap toothpaste I had before this was just as good. I'll give it four stars just because well I can't say anything bad about it."
2.00,"I really did not like the \"taste\" of this product. It had a slight metallic ting to it. I am going to stick with Listerene."
5.00,"Love the taste and the texture of this toothpaste. Great product!!!"
5.00,"this product really has the wow factor. it leaves your mouth feeling clean and fresh way longer than other mouthwashes. love it. will buy it again."
5.00,"i was very happy with it! It exceded my expectations and i will continue to look for this product."
5.00,"After using the Crest clinical rinse and toothpaste for one week my teeth feel cleaner and look whiter. It feels like I just had them cleaned professionally."
5.00,"Crest ProHealth left my mouth feeling fresh and cleaner than most toothpastes that I have used in the past. I actually want to brush my teeth more often because it leaves such a sparkly feeling in my mouth!"
5.00,"I'm not a fan of mouthwashes in general, but my husband really likes this one. In fact, he likes it better than Listerine, which has always been his favorite - until now!"
5.00,"Usually our family of 5 uses 5 different toothpastes and 5 different rinses. This product was tried and liked by everyone!"
5.00,"It made my mouth feel fresh and really clean for a long time. I would highly recommend it. Great product."
5.00,"I love crest pro-health, everything from the tooth paste which makes your teeth feel clean and fresh for hours, the rinse has a refreshing aftertaste and the floss is great for getting into tight contacts"
5.00,"Great Product. I will definitely be buying this product again."
5.00,"This just reconfirmed that this is my favorite toothpaste!"
5.00,"Loved this! Made my teeth feel so clean and smooth!"
4.00,"The combination of this family of products helped lessen some tea stains and made my teeth seem cleaner and whiter!"
5.00,"I struggle with plaque build-up and this toothpaste really did the trick for me. My teeth felt clean all day long."
5.00,"Awesome results, would definitely recommend. No doubt"
5.00,"This toothpaste was great and made me feel like I was really doing something great for my teeth. It seem like it is super healthy for both teeth & gums and has a good taste."
4.00,"I love this mouthwash but my daughter says that it has a very bad aftertaste."
4.00,"I'm a big fan of Crest toothpaste and have been using it, in combination with Sonicare toothbrushes, for many years. The result has been that I've been able to curtail regular dental checkups, since time after time I was hearing, \"No plaque, no tartar. Keep on doing what you're doing. That will be ninety dollars please.\" If this new product makes my teeth whiter as well, I'll be even more pleased."
4.00,"This toothpaste has a great flavor and makes your entire mouth feel clean. I have sensitive teeth and it seemed to help with that. Overall great feeling in your mouth."
4.00,"Loved the mouthwash, it kept me feeling fresh a lot longer than my normal mouth was and without that lingering alcohol flavor."
5.00,"Makes my mouth feel so much more clean than all the others out there. This is great stuff!"
4.00,"I like that this mouthwash does not burn like some mouthwashes and also that it not only freshens your breath but works to protect your teeth."
5.00,"This is the only toothpaste my family and I use. It leaves your mouth feeling clean and fresh."
5.00,"I have been using the mouthwash for about 2 weeks and I really like how clean my mouth feels after. I actually feel like it is cleaning my mouth and it leaves my mouth fresh for a long time after."
4.00,"I bought this for the first time over a month ago. It's great because it's not as harsh as other mouthwashs, but it's not too gentle either. It really feels like it's deepcleaning my mouth. I will definitely buy this again."
5.00,"I loved the feeling the Crest Pro-Health rinse left in my mouth. It had a great taste and I could tell it was working throughout the day. As a coffee drinker and someone that has lots of face-to-face interaction throughout the day, it's important to me to have a product I'm confident will help keep my breath fresh and keep my teeth and gums healthy! I can find both in this product!"
3.00,"The active ingredient in this toothpaste is Stannous Floride. The same as regular Crest, so the only reason to purchase this paste versus regular ole Crest is because of the minty freshness. I found that it was much stronger than Crest's regular minty taste. In fact, it was too strong for my son. Left my mouth feeling fresh; my teeth scrubbed clean. (note: there's a warning not to use it longer than 2 weeks with out dentist approval. A puzzle that.)"
4.00,"I only buy Crest for our family's dental needs at home and this rinse is a good one; however, with the price being double what their regular rinse runs, we will stick to the regular rinse."
4.00,"This is the second Pro-health product I have tried. The first was Pro-health Glide dental floss (no real difference from the standard version), and now this: a toothpaste for the over-50's. Crest claims this toothpaste has a smoother formulation than other Crest products. If so, I sure couldn't feel it. In fact, this product felt a bit grittier than the Crest products in the silver tubes. Nevertheless, this is a very nice product. Both my wife and I enjoy the taste and the cleaning ability. We also like the other Crest products equally well. Clearly, this product is mostly marketing hype. We all know that the population is aging and the number of people over 50 has grown dramatically (baby boomers). This is an obvious ploy to try to corner some of this segment. Would I buy this product again? Yes, if it cost less per ounce than other Crest products. Otherwise, I will pass it by. Let's face it, Crest Pro-health For Life is just another shameless marketing ploy to rope in a new segment of the population. Crest, really?"
5.00,"I use the sensitive form of the prohealth and my husband uses the gum care and we use the mouth wash and we love this brand. It works well on my sensitive teeth and it has worked well on his gums also. Our dentist reccomends it."
4.00,"This rinse tastes and seems great, but it is too early to tell if it has additional benefits beyond the Crest Multi-Protection rinse I already use."
5.00,"My teeth have never felt so clean, except for when I have just left the dentist's after a cleaning. What a great product. Love it, love it, love it."
3.00,"My teeth do feel much cleaner, but the taste and/or the foaming action makes me gag."
4.00,"The new crest toothpaste is great, it keep my teeth from getting grimy all day."
4.00,"Teeth felt great. Very clean feeling, great taste."
5.00,"This toothpaste did an excellent job cleaning our teeth while brushing with the usual amount of time and effort. Our teeth are noticably whiter after only a few weeks use. It also has a fresh clean taste that doesn't linger."
5.00,"My husband and I both liked the prohealth mouthwash."
3.00,"First off, I wasn't crazy about the price of this product but I bought it anyway. Then when I tried it for the first time I thought it tasted horrible. But I kept on using it to give a fair try and although I truly dislike the taste and foamy feeling while using it I got to say it works great. I probably won't be replacing my good ol' Listerine but I think I might alternate use of this mouthwash with my usual."
5.00,"When I used the mouthwash, my mouth felt very refreshing and clean"
5.00,"The crest whitening products boast a whiter smile in seven days. I decided to use Crest Pro-Health Whitening Toothpaste in conjunction with theCrest Whitening Mouthwash. The idea of doing something I do every day anyway to whiten my smile seemed like a winner to me. The taste of this toothpaste is pretty good, but the texture is really strange. It's VERY gritty. I felt like I was sandblasting my way to a whiter smile. I have to admit, I was a little shocked by the fact that my teeth actually did look whiter after ten days of use. (see photo) Even if it didn't whiten my teeth, it tastes okay so I would go ahead and finish the tube, unlike the mouthwash, which is kind of gross."
5.00,"I love this mouthwash because it does not contain alcohol and leaves my mouth feeling really clean and fresh. I use it after brushing and flossing and really love how it compliments by routine."
4.00,"THIS PRODUCT WAS GREAT AT MAKING MY TEETH FEEL LIKE I JUST GOT A CLEANING AT MY DENTIST OFFICE."
5.00,"I just love this product, not only does it work but your teeth feel sparkly clean and slick to the touch after use. There is no residue left and no aftertaste, so you truly know this is doing the job it claims to do in taking care of your teeth!"
5.00,"I love how clean my mouth feels, it was so fresh and stayed that way for a while. I liked the flavor and the fact that there was not any aftertaste!"
5.00,"Great product. Teeth not only looked noticeably cleaner but also felt cleaner. Would definitely recommend."
5.00,"I like this stuff. It works and all mouthwashes are pretty much the same anyway. So choose the kind you like."
4.00,"It's a great addition to use with the other great crest products."
4.00,"left my teeth clean and tasted great. Wish it came in sensitive formula."
5.00,"I loved how clean and whole mouth felt! Some toothpastes don't feel like they are keeping my mouth clean during the day, but this one did"
4.00,"I liked the product (toothpaste) I always look for a toothpaste that helps with plague removal."
5.00,"I love crest toothpaste it always leaves my mouth feeling fresh and clean. And really does the job."
4.00,"My family loved this toothpaste even though it is a little pricey."
4.00,"I haven't been to a dentist in years- no cavities. P&G admits it can stain my teeth and the dentist can remove it. I'm not going to take this kind of a risk and only those who go to the dentist every 6 months might. So no twice a day for me. I use Multiprotection after breakfast because I would like the benefits for my gums. Then I'm using the Crest 3D White Rinse at bedtime to whiten and if need be counteract any staining by Multiprotection. I do notice the coffee and tea stains are lightening and there seems to be no staining from the Multiprotection after one week of use."
5.00,"This was great toothpaste... whitening, but not too tough on sensitive teeth. Overall, a great purchase. Crest is a brand I trust."
5.00,"I love Crest toothpastes - haven't tried one that doesn't work well. This left a very clean, refreshing feeling in yoru mouth."
4.00,"I am used to more \"refreshing\" mouth rinse. I cannot speak of the \"multi-protection\" benefits, but if I prefer a different mouthwash, I will use the one I like more often than this one. It's ok, bit I like a little more \"zing\" and a stronger wintergreen flavor."
4.00,"left mouth feeling great and fresh. taste not too strong as some tend to be"
3.00,"This mouthwash has a nice minty flavor. These alcohol-free mouthwashes tend to leave a weird, dryish feeling in my mouth, particularly on my tongue. You don't get the typical \"burn\" of regular mouthwash, but you do feel a bit of a tingling sensation in your mouth afterwards. This tingling sensation is really mild and doesn't last long."
1.00,"My teeth are naturally quite white. I don't drink coffee and only drink tea on occasion.  I take good care of my teeth by brushing, flossing and regularly using a Sulca Brush. When I got Invisalign braces I was advised to take my oral hygiene up another notch and use a anti-cavity rinse. I used an Oral B rinse for about six months with excellent results but it was recalled due to manufacturing problems. As a result I switched over to Crest Pro-health. Since using Crest Pro-Health, like many other reviewers on Amazon, I developed very noticable brown stains on my teeth. I've never had a problem with tooth staining before, I haven't changed anything else in my approach to oral hygiene and assume that it is because of the Pro-Health. I have stopped using it and do not recommend the product."
5.00,"This toothpaste not only makes your teeth feel clean, they look much cleaner as well. They appear whiter, with less tartar build-up."
5.00,"Was able to keep the \"just been to the dentist\" clean that I love!"
5.00,"I love the fresh taste and clean teeth it gave me. It is a great find for a fair price."
5.00,"It along with the toothpaste worked great together to remove the daily plague built up and left my mouth feel like I just walked out of the dentist office!"
4.00,"Normally use Listerine.. I've been converted! Leaves a super clean feeling on teeth"
5.00,"I like the night formula toothpaste that has a different flavor than the regular one."
1.00,"Had a coupon to purchase 2 of these for the price of one, brought 2 tubes home. 1 and 3/4 of the tubes are now in my county land fill. Plaque build-up increased, teeth did not fill as clean, and the stuff left my mouth feeling uncomfortable (weird) and painfully sensitive to cold liquids for 1 or 2 hours. Not something I'll purchase again in this lifetime."
4.00,"I think it tasted a little stronger than other crest toothpaste. love the way they package this product. will buy it again."
5.00,"I love this mouthwash. My mouth feels clean and fresh without the burn."
5.00,"I have been using this line of toothpaste for a while, this one in particular does make my teeth feel cleaner. I will see how well this works on my next dentist visit. Thank you."
3.00,"The taste of the Crest Pro Health mouth rinse was okay. Didn't burn which is good. I guess it was doing it's job. I didn't notice any big changes in the way my mouth felt. Maybe if you are not obsessive like I am when it comes to cleaning your teeth, this would be a good addition to your oral care."
4.00,"I am pleased with this product and I like the taste and how it makes my mouth feel after brushing but I am troubled by information on the box which references possible staining of teeth because of the fluoride used. I gave it four stars because it seems to work well but the information makes me wonder if I really should be using this and the information is under an \"Other information\" section rather than a \"warning\" section. The box states under \"Other information\" that \"products containing stannous fluoride may produce surface staining of teeth.\" The information further states that adequate brushing may prevent the stains which are not harmful or permanent and can be removed by a dentist. The box then states \"this Crest is especially formulated to help prevent staining.\" This troubles me. I would hate to have to pay my dentist to remove stains caused by stannous fluoride and I will be talking to my dentist about this product when I see him. This being said I saw a lot of positive things about this fluoride when I searched the web. I know nothing about fluoride. I assumed before I tried this that all toothpaste was the same so I think people need to be aware of what is in this or any toothpaste and check with their dentists to see if it is okay for them to use. As for the product I like the taste and the way it makes my mouth feel. If it was not for the information I referenced above and how it was listed on the box I would give this five stars."
5.00,"I used this toothpaste for a month, and went to my semi-annual cleaning appointment. My Dental Hygenist actually complimented me and told me that I can now return to a semi-annual cleaning schedule as opposed to the every 4 months that I was having to keep up with. She wanted to know what changes I had made and I showed her the tube. Now I smile a whole lot more!"
5.00,"I have sensitive teeth and this product helps seal that sensitivity all day long. The fresh taste is great too! Buy some today, you will not regret it!"
4.00,"I really did love this mouthwash. It doesn't sting and burn like other products with alochol in them. I'm not sure if the rinse itself was responsible for whitening my teeth or just the fact that it made my mouth feel so fresh and clean that I brushed and rinsed more frequently."
5.00,"great taste, my kids even liked it. i would defintely reccomend it"
5.00,"The Crest clinical line really made my teeth feel clean and fresh, almost as good as the dentist's office. I don't usually like to pay more than the minimum for toothpaste but you could really tell the difference!"
5.00,"As is customary for Crest, this toothpaste had a fresh taste and left my teeth feeling clean."
5.00,"I have been using Crest Pro-Health products for years and couldn't be happier. I use the whitening toothpaste with the multi-protection mouthwash in the morning (for anticavity/gingivitis) and the same toothpaste with the complete mouthwash at night (for fluoride) and my mouth always feels great. With this mouthwash you don't have to experience the burn of alcohol and your mouth will actually feel fresher in my opinion because there isn't the aftertaste of it or the dryness that it can cause. There is an aftertaste of course if you just rinse and go about your business, but I've never done that. I always rinse vigorously after brushing and then again after using the mouthwash because there's no reason any chemicals should sit in your mouth all day. The mouthwash does its job and I know it did something because even after I rinse, my mouth still feels clean and minty, even after the first meal. Maybe the reason people are experiencing some of these problems is because they don't rinse out the excess mouthwash that clings to the mouth, tongue, and teeth with water afterwards. The tongue is the worst as it usually turns blue, but all it takes is a few gentle scrapes with your top row of teeth and a few rinses and it looks normal again. I personally have never experienced even a slight bit of staining, numbness, or loss of taste. Like I said I rinse afterwards, but I also floss twice a day with whitening picks, which prevents the tough to reach staining that can appear between teeth that I only noticed when I first started using the product. I just feel that some people might be doing something wrong to experience all of the issues, but then again I might just be part of the minority. Another thing people complain about is the cap on the Crest toothpastes. I buy a new tube every month generally and not a single one has become damaged even slightly. I flip it open, squeeze, and then flip it closed every morning and night with no issue. There seem to be a lot of problems with different Crest products and fortunately I am part of the apparently small group of people that hasn't experienced any of them. Crest products rock I definitely recommend them!"
2.00,"My son and I have both been using this toothpaste for a couple of months.  Like many of the people that have submitted reviews, I also have developed the white film, which I'm sure is skin.  While I haven't noticed any sores, or sore throat, my lips have started getting sensitive. My son hasn't said anything, but now that I know this film is a result of this toothpaste, and not something medical, I'm going to talk to him in the morning.  Might need to just throw it away. I'm a Crest fan, so I don't have a problem using other Crest products, but I would caution you to just be aware of what's going on with your mouth. If it works for you, fantastic! And if not, well I'm going to try something a little lest \"Clinical\""
5.00,"I have very sensitive teeth and also have had some issues in the past with enamel. In the time I've been using this product my dentist has noticed a huge difference. My teeth are less sensitive and the white spots have almost completely disapeared. I would never switch unless they came out with a better version of this!"
3.00,"This is the first time I've received a bundled dental kit. It's like \"The Best of Crest Pro-Health\". I'm not sure who would buy such a kit (is it a birthday gift for someone who really loves their teeth? Or for a student going off to college? Or is it a CARE package for a loved one in the Armed Forces? Maybe). The only reason I see an ordinary consumer buying it is for purely economic reasons - if it's actually cheaper to buy this set rather than buying each individual item (which is what most people do). As of this date, Amazon has no price for the bundle, so I can't compare (I will update this review when the price appears once again). The kit consists of the following: Crest Pro-Health Healthy Fresh Toothpaste Crest Pro-Health Multi-Protection Refreshing Clean Mint Mouthwash Crest Pro-Health All-in-One Medium Toothbrush Oral-B Glide Pro-Health Deep Clean Floss First, the all-in-one medium toothbrush is decent but since I use Sonicare, it is of limited use to me. Since I have receding gums, I have given up using manual toothbrushes. However, for the everyday user (hubby) it works fine. Nothing special. The second item that particularly interested me was the mouthwash. As some of you know, there has been controversy over Listerine because long-term use of any mouthwash containing alchohol is reputedly linked to oral cancer. Hence, I was interested to see if this Crest Pro-health Multi-Protection Alcohol Free, Clean Mint mouthwash was a viable alterative. It has a minty taste and leaves a mild, tingly feeling (definitely not as strong as Listerine). However, I understand from reading some reviews on this product that it contains a stain-causing chemical. Since I used it only few times, I can't judge whether this effect is true. So far my teeth look fine and I don't see any excessive brown stains. I can't speak for whether the mouthwash is any better than Listerine, though. Since alcohol does kill germs, I am suspicious that it may not be as effective for long term use as Listerine. As a compromise, I plan to alternate this mouthwash with Listerine. Next. Oral-B Glide Pro-Health Deep Clean Floss. I love Glide. No problems here, and I love the fact that it doesn't shred as easily as other brands do. The best part of this set for me. Lastly, the toothpaste. According to the box, it has everything you'd want in a toothpaste: fights cavities, gingivitis, gum disease, brightens teeth and removes stains (ironic if the staining mouthwash rumors are true -you brush your teeth to get rid of stains only to get it back again!). However, it terms of taste, I didn't like it. While the color is a cool mint blue, it leaves your mouth with a strange burning sensation. I am a long time user of Colgate Total, and have never experienced this type of stinging. Strangely enough, it leaves your mouth with the effect that Listerine does! But I much prefer Colgate because I prefer my toothpaste to be bland - I'll leave the stinging feeling to the mouthwash. There you have it. So I have mixed feelings about this kit because I couldn't verify where the mouthwash really leaves brown stains as other reviewers have pointed out. Time will tell, and I will update my review accordingly."
3.00,"This toothpaste is NOT as \"minty\" as I usually prefer, and it seems to taste of old cans. It is also quite a bit \"grittier\" than I want a toothpaste to be. There is very little foaming as one brushes. I will not be purchasing this product again."
5.00,"I like this toothpaste because of its health benefits, and great meant taste."
4.00,"I enjoyed the way that this product had so many benefits combined into one toothpaste."
4.00,"I liked this product, but I have used others that have made my breath stay fresher longer. I would, however, buy this product in the future."
5.00,"My husband and I loved it. Our teeth felt clean even after we ate and up until bedtime. It's a great product with lots of benefits, especially if your teeth are sensitive. Thanks for allowing me to try such a great product that I definitely will continue to purchase."
4.00,"Overall, I was impressed with the Crest Clinical mouthwash. It made my teeth feel very clean and the feeling lasted. However, I wish that the minty flavor was a little more minty and a little less medicinal tasting."
5.00,"will continue to use this one! I highly recommend it."
5.00,"Got a sample of this on my last visit to the dentist and loved it. Now it's always on the bathroom vanity."
4.00,"This product was great, left my teeth feeling fresh and clean. But it is still more than I would like to pay for toothpaste."
4.00,"These are top quality products. I feel like there is a visible difference when I use the toothpaste and mouthwash together. Love them!"
4.00,"I liked this mouthwash because it wasn't too strong where it hurt my mouth, yet it left my mouth/breath feeling clean."
5.00,"Left my mouth and teeth feeling very clean. It didn't have an over powering taste."
4.00,"My husband loves the crest line of mouthwash so I was excited to purchase this for him. Based on his use, he would definitely purchase it again. He loved how it made his mouth feel clean and refreshed."
1.00,"I have used this product but instead of turning my teeth brown like most other's, my teeth turned a yellow-orange color, especially close to the gums.Immediately went back to Scope and Literine. No more Crest products in this household."
5.00,"Since I started using Crest Clinical Pro Health, my dentist has commented on the condition of my gums and how much better they look. You can actually feel it working after you brush! I have also noticed that I have less plaque buildup then I used to have. This will be the only toothpaste I use!"
4.00,"I loved this product and will use it again. This seemed to do a better job than others that I have used."
5.00,"I love all the Crest Pro Health products! The floss is amazing. Very easy to use, so I don't dread flossing. My daughters like it too, which is huge :) The toothpaste isn't overpoweringly minty like some others can be. I also like the texture of the paste, very smooth. All and all, we will stick with Crest Pro Health!"
1.00,"I bought this mouthwash on a whim last week because it was on sale, and because it had no alcohol. I used it only twice and developed severe pain in my molars (sensitivity to touch and pressure), a sore throat, swollen sores on my tongue, stains near my gum line, and I lost my sense of taste for 12 hours. I thought I was just being paranoid, so I did a Google search for this product, lo and behold, there are pages upon pages of consumer complaints for this product. After warning my husband about it, he also had the same problems. I contacted P&G, only to be told that all of these things are normal. They told me that I should brush my teeth and have my teeth cleaned by a dentist, as if I wasn't already doing that. To add to the insult, they offered me a coupon for their toothpaste. An oral care company should realize that insurance only pays for two cleanings a year, and anything beyond that is out of pocket. I should not have to pay for a special cleaning because of my mouthwash! I have since switched to another brand and, not shockingly, my symptoms have disappeared. I cannot believe that a company can create a product with such dangerous side effects, arrogantly call those side effects normal, and continue to sell the product knowing that consumers will trust it because it is a name brand. I will never buy a Crest product again, and I have told every single person I know about the issues I have experienced. It sounds silly, but never underestimate the power of word of mouth. If you had a bad experience, tell someone!"
1.00,"I used this product twice, once at night and then again the next morning, and I noticed all day that I couldn't really taste anything. I did experiments to see if it was just one type of taste (sweet, salty, etc) but it was everything! It's been about 12 hours now and I still can't taste.  I was very worried until I came on here and saw that many people had this same reaction. This feeling is absolutely indescribable, and funny actually. Needless to say, I will not be buying this product again."
5.00,"loved the toothpaste it worked great for myself and my family. All happy smiles here :D"
4.00,"Does a good job of cleaning teeth, makes your mouth feel refreshed."
4.00,"Great clean feeling after brushing! Could have a more minty taste though."
4.00,"I have tried the mouthwash, the toothbrush and the toothpaste. I LOVE the toothbrush--it has really cool features like the flexible head. I thought the toothpaste was great too. I'm kind of torn on the mouthwash--I really liked the taste (not like alcohol, so you don't smell like mouthwash when you're done), but being a \"clinical\" strength I expected it to last a lot longer with freshness, but that was not the case."
5.00,"My dentist is very particular and this is the new toothpaste he would only recommend (he used to recommend another brand but he said Pro Health has surpassed the previous brand). I have been using it for quite a while and I am happy with the result. I trust this brand. I just wish Crest would bring back the cinnamon flavor. I hate mint and was very happy to have that option. But now I can't find cinnamon anywhere."
4.00,"I like this toothpaste more than most. It leaves your mouth really fresh and the freshness seems to last a little longer than other toothpastes. It's not exactly like leaving the dentist but it does a pretty darn good job!"
5.00,"My husband and I both LOVE this toothpaste. Our teeth feel like we've been to the dentist! Awesome!"
5.00,"I had always used Crest pro health. But now I am hooked on the clinical braand. My mouth feels extra clean and the taste is wonderful."
2.00,"I have always used and loved Crest products they have always been of consistently high quality. I jumped at the opportunity to try Crest's new Pro-Health Clinical. I was thus surprised that I was not fond of the flavor. I decided to look past that and continue using it to gauge its benefit to my overall oral hygiene. Within 24 hours there was some type of film in my mouth and within 48 hours my tongue felt extremely raw. I put the toothpaste away. I'm back to my regular Crest and each of those issues has vanished. I hate to give negative feedback but the truth is the truth..."
5.00,"My mouth feels very clean and stays fresh hours after use. I's helping to strengthen my gums as well."
4.00,"The products are high-quality and efficient to use. For example, the slight waxing and mint flavour of the dental floss made navigating even the back teeth simple, and the mouthwash is refreshing and removes residual food particles. I did see some improvement in tooth colour after a week of using the toothpaste. It's a valuable combination."
4.00,"like all of the Crest products my Family uses,this one is no exception to the quality and results we expect."
5.00,"I use the crest toothpaste and mouthwash,it really made a difference in the way my teeth felt,they felt like I had been to the dentist and had a cleaning done;"
5.00,"As far as I am concerned this is the best toothpaste made.  I have used this for over two years and have never been happier with this type of product. The taste is great, it makes my mouth feel very clean, and my check ups are great as well as easier cleanings. I would highly recommend this product for anyone!"
5.00,"I love this rinse. It leaves my mouth feeling fresh without the burning some other washes cause. I will continue to use this product and recommend it to others!"
5.00,"This toothpaste works great. I have really sensitive teeth so this is perfect."
1.00,"Used this product once and noticed taste lost the next day, but didn't connect the dots until a day later when the issue continued and I found information on Crests own FAQ indicating the product can cause taste problems.  It's shocking this is still on the market."
5.00,"My teeth felt clean and had a good aftertaste. I would use it again."
5.00,"This toothpaste tastes great, leaves a great minty freshness after brushing, and I love all the foaming action."
4.00,"I found this product to be too harsh on the teeth and gums. I probably would not purchase or use this toothpaste again."
4.00,"This toothpaste has a great taste and left my mouth feeling clean for hours after I brushed!"
4.00,"The pro-health rinse leaves your mouth tingly and feeling fresh."
1.00,"Don't buy this toothpaste! I took a look at crest's website, and the reviews there don't seem to mention all of the painful mouth sores I got after using this product. How strange, because here on Amazon, and just about everywhere else on the internet, I have found lots of people who have had the exact same experience as me. I've never had this problem with any toothpaste, ever. In the FAQ on Crest's page it mentions that the skin inside of your mouth might \"shed\" while using this product. Yep. That's true. It's not written on the box or the tube, but it's true. Somehow they missed the part where it burns like heckfire and blisters your tongue and cheeks though. It hurt to move my tongue, which is a bit inconvenient when, say, eating, drinking, talking, and breathing. So I switched toothpastes and sure enough, a week or so later, no more mouth sores. I'm not one to say things like this, but I'm seriously never buying a crest product again, and I'm going to be researching every Procter and Gamble product thoroughly before using it. I'm baffled that this toothpaste is still on the market. Never again, Crest."
5.00,"I have been using this product for 2 weeks and I have noticed a difference within the first week my teeth feel so much cleaner and longer lasting good breath"
4.00,"No complaints. I love the clean, smooth feeling. The fresh breath is of course an awesome plus! Lol!"
1.00,"Bought product, opened lid,snapped right off. next morning product leeked over everything in my drawer...."
5.00,"Love how clean my teeth feel! Will definitely buy this tooth paste!"
5.00,"I really liked this toothpaste and it leaves your breath feeling fresh and clean."
3.00,"I tried the tooth paste because I get a lot of plaque. I found it did work better than normal tooth paste. I have, also, tried AquaFresh Tarter Control works better for me. I haven't tried the mouth wash and look forward to using it."
5.00,"I already love the the Crest brand however, after trying the Crest Pro Health left my teeth clean with no plaque feeling. I have been sharing my thoughts on this product with my friend and family and they tried it too and fell in love with Crest Pro Health. Great Job Crest."
5.00,"Our dentist recommended a mouthwash that would do cleaning, and plaque control and I think this is the best we've tried."
3.00,"I liked the initial taste of it and the fact that it didn't burn like most mouthwashes, but I found it tasted funny afterwards. Which made me go back to my old burning mouthwash. I guess I'm old school, the burn tells me it's working! :) I do still recommend this product for someone who really isn't in to that stinging sensation of their mouthwashes though."
1.00,"This mouthwash smelled like Pepto Bismol when I opened the cap. It tasted like peroxide, not mint. It made my tongue feel wierd the rest of the day and I did not notice an improvement on how clean my mouth felt. I'll stick with the other Crest mouthwash."
4.00,"I love this mouthwash not like any i have used beforewill definantly purchase again."
5.00,"I had no gingivitis problems that I know of before using this product, nor did my wife.  I bought a tube, and my wife and I used it until it was empty.  We liked it.  No peeling or sensitivity as reported by others.  It's not as powerful for breath as some of the other Crest toothpastes that have mouthwash built it, or have strong mint, but not bad.  I'd use it again."
5.00,"Teeth really feel clean after using. I like this toothpast and am a loyal Crest fan!"
1.00,"This is a terrible line of Crest products. I don't know what is causing this, but like the other reviews say, it dried my mouth, made it super sensitive to EVERYTHING, and my gums started to peel a thin white layer. I will never buy this product again. It's unfortunate that my fiance loves it. He doesn't seem to have this problem. These are also small tubes, not full size!"
5.00,"My husband and I both love the Crest Pro Health toothpaste. It is definately my toothpaste of choice!"
4.00,"I must say that I did notice my teeth felt smooth and clean longer than with my other toothpaste. My mouth felt fresh and clean for hours after my morning brushing. Nice product!"
2.00,"I thought the tootpaste felt very gritty and I really didn't like the taste."
5.00,"I enjoyed this as it really accomplished what it says. It makes my mouth smell great & keeps my teeth clean!"
3.00,"Will purchase again. Really liked the taste compared to what I've had before."
5.00,"My teeth feel very clean and smooth like I just had them cleaned at dentist office. I Love it!"
4.00,"Not a fan of aftertaste but decent paste. Will probably order different flavor of Crest in the future but this is okay if you don't hate baking soda"
5.00,"I am thrilled with the super whitening power in Crest Whitening toothpaste! It has a pleasant taste and leaves my teeth feeling dentist office clean!"
4.00,"Like hydrogen peroxide in mouthwash, some people have significant negative reactions to Stannous Fluoride. That is the active ingredient in Crest Pro-Health toothpaste, so keep that in mind. For me, it is a good basic toothpaste and I enjoy using it. It leaves my mouth feeling clean and fresh, and the minty flavor does not linger and make food taste bad. It is not amazing and I prefer the version with Scope Outlast, but it is a good product that does the job."
4.00,"LOVE the floss, even with sensitive teeth it leaves my teeth clean without irritation."
1.00,"I have never written a review before, but after a weekend from hell, I'm hoping to stop others from experiencing the pain I've gone through.I have never had tooth or mouth pain and see my dentist every six months. No more, no less. I first bought this mouthwash about a week ago because the results promised were encouraging. Since then I have had to go to my dentist emergently as it caused major inflamation of my entire mouth (gums, tounge, etc., causing my gum tissue to slough off) not to mention making my teeth hyper sensitive and my jaw stiff. This is in addition to killing off taste buds mentioned in all these other reviews. Not relating this to my new mouthwash, I continued to gargle hoping that it would relieve the pain.I spent an excruciating weekend waiting to see my dentist on Monday thinking perhaps it was oral cancer (I am a former smoker) or some sort of aggressive periodontal disease. Imagine my surprise when it was discovered it was more than likely related the mouthwash I used to relieve the symptoms. Large doses of ibuprofen taken over the course of a few days, and salt water/baking soda gargle have done wonders. Now just have to pay off an unnecessary dental bill and hopefully the pain of this whole experience will go away.This was one expensive bottle of rinse. Use with caution."
5.00,"This is a great toothpaste...left my mouth feeling clean & fresh!"
3.00,"My teeth felt clean but just like the tooth brush i'm not sure why its so expensive."
4.00,"I tried Crest Clinical Pro Health toothpaste and mouth rinse. I love the flavor of both! The rinse was great because it did not burn my mouth like other well known products and I was concerned about it burning. The rinse did keep my mouth feeling fresh and clean for 4-5 hours and I would just rinse again. I mean since it don't burn, you can rinse often. The toothpaste left my teeth feeling clean and I would buy these products again."
5.00,"Great toothpaste. Has a great taste. I would reccomend everyone try this for the price and product."
5.00,"Hard to find in any drug store lately, so I was very happy to see Walmart still carries this and deliveres straight to my door!!! Proof in the old saying....\"if you find a product you like, buy a life-time supply, as they will stop making it eventually\"!"
5.00,"Pro health is one of my tabs. Left my mouth feeling clean for a few hours. Unlike other where after I'm done brushing 10 min later feel like I need yo brush again."
4.00,"My teeth looked great and even better felt great! I would highly recommend this paste to all my friends, family."
5.00,"I have not used this tooth paste long enough to know if it lives up to all claims but it is really nice pleasant tasting tooth paste and I need all the things it promises to do so I will continue to use it. I don't think you need to be over fifty to like it. You can have problems with your teeth at any age. I am glad I discovered it."
5.00,"This is the only toothpaste I use. I love this product nice and minty!"
1.00,"I just stumbled upon these reviews and I am SO happy I did! I have been having problems with my mouth for a year and a half that have gotten increasingly worse. I've been using Pro Health for three years, so I've never considered that was the issue. I am feeling a combination of relief and frustration right now. Wow! It's my toothpaste causing me all of these problems.I have been to two doctors, a dentist, and an oral surgeon. I've had blood work done to check for vitamin deficiencies and diseases, and I've had two biopsies of the inside of my lower lip. Nothing has been found that could cause my problems. I have become so depressed lately because of my sore and swollen mucous membranes in my mouth, lack of taste, dry mouth, and bad breath that I have considered asking my doctor for an antidepressant. This has really been adversely affecting my life. I want to cry right now... out of pure joy at the possibility of getting my mouth and life back to normal by throwing away my Pro Health, as well as out of frustration that Crest knows how this is affecting people and they continue to sell it. I am hoping that no permanent damage had been done to my mouth. As I write this review the inside of my lips are raw, tender, swollen, and sticking to my teeth because they are also dry. I have a bad taste in my mouth. I can't wait for this to end. I can't wait to kiss my boyfriend again!! I can't wait to be able to have a conversion with someone and worry that my breath will offend them! I've always had beautiful teeth, fresh breath, and excellent hygiene. This has been a nightmare!"
5.00,"Crest Pro-Health is the best toothpaste that I have ever used! It was like I had just visited the dentist for a cleaning every time that I used it. I have always used Crest but they have found a definite winner with this product."
2.00,"We began using the Crest ProHealth whitening fresh clean mint a few months back. Previously we were using Crest Whitening plus Scope. In comparing the two, the whitening plus scope leaves our mouths with a fresh mint taste however the Prohealth does not. Seems as though we have to brush our teeth several times to get fair results when we use the ProHealth."
4.00,"The mouth wash was great. Good taste without being overwhelming. Freshness lasts a long time."
4.00,"I Like this product makes my teeth feel very clean."
5.00,"Excellent toothpaste. I sometimes feel a film on my teeth proir to my dental cleaning. I did experience a reduction in the amount of film residue on my teeth. The price is a little higher than I normally pay for toothpaste. Thanks for the oportunity to try it."
1.00,"Into the trash it goes."
5.00,"love the clean feeling! I always use crest products."
5.00,"I really like this floss. My teeth are very close together and this gets between easily."
5.00,"I love the clean, fresh feeling I get when I use this mouth wash. I will never use anything else again."
5.00,"I was really pleased with the results; it left my teeth feeling very clean."
5.00,"I love all the Crest products but find as I age special products by Crest such as this plaque toothpaste and their toothpaste for fighting gum disease help my mouth feel better. Keep inventing great products as the above mentioned and I will keep buying and using them."
4.00,"Mouthwash was good- not great because of the harsh flavor. But, it did get mouth feeling fresh and clean."
4.00,"My husband and I both love this product. My mouth does feel cleaner longer. However, I have to hold off using it in the morning until after my morning coffee and breakfast due to the after taste."
5.00,"The toothpaste was good and refreshing. I liked the way it left my teeth."
3.00,"I only use Crest toothpaste, but I don't have any preference for a specific type. As a result, I have tried a lot of different Crest varieties. Like most of them, this toothpaste works great. My teeth feel clean and smooth after brushing, and while the flavor isn't quite as minty as some other varieties, it is still pleasant. However, I had one major problem with this product. It comes in the type of tube that has a big, flat flip-up lid serving as a base. Usually when I buy that type of toothpaste, I keep it upright, sitting on the base. When I do that with this container, the toothpaste flows out. After the first night I used it, I woke up to a big mess of toothpaste all over the lid and leaking out onto the shelf it was sitting on. I'm not sure if this specific one was defective, or if all these tubes of toothpaste will make such a mess. Either way, I wasn't very happy having to clean it up."
5.00,"My pregnancy was anything but normal with the exception of one area, morning sickness that lasted all day long. Crest was the only toothpaste that didn't upset my stomach. Even better than that I was always confident that my mouth was clean, my breath was fresh and my dental health was on track. Thanks Crest every Pro Health product has been right on the mark but please keep that price in check."
5.00,"Exactly what I have to come expect from the Crest line of tooth care product. Makes teeth feel clean and fresh.."
4.00,"This toothpaste is great as it provides benefits such as preventing cavities, gingivitis, helps with sensitivity and has a great taste. I personally prefer gels (like the Listerine one) than pastes, but this one is not as thick as other pastes so I have stuck using it for quite some time now. Since toothpaste is one of these products that you'll have to use daily, then I suggest you consider using Amazon Subscribe and Save and have it delivered automatically to save extra."
4.00,"This product was excellent. It left my mouth feeling Extremely Clean. This Clean feeling lasted. I've used regular toothpaste vs. this and I noticed a great deal of difference. It's amazing."
3.00,"I gave this toothpaste to my mom who is 74 and has experienced many of the ailments this product by Crest claims to offer. We use Crest products with regularity and trust them, but after about four weeks, my mom tells me that she has not seen any visible changes. Now mind you she could just be too sensitive at this point, but my review is based upon her experience as I am not the intended target audience this toothpaste was meant for. If she decides to continue using the toothpaste and experiences any visible changes I will update this review accordingly."
5.00,"I have been using Crest product for a long time and I honestly love all of it. This mouth wash makes me feel even more confident with my smile, love the taste, feel and everything about it!!!!"
4.00,"I love the way this toothpaste made my teeth and mouth feel. There was just something about the taste that I didn't care for. It left a weird taste in my mouth that was hard to get rid of. Overall, it was still a good toothpaste."
5.00,"whitening and sensitivity treatment in one toothpaste"
5.00,"I tried the crest toothpaste and I really love it. It also leaves a fresh taste in your mouth after brushing."
4.00,"I like the toothpaste and will use it again, thank you for introducing it to use!"
1.00,"The toothpaste is o.k. but if you have o.c.d. or if you're a person that hates messy stuff you are going to hate it because the toothpaste comes out off the tube with the cap on,i brush my teeth at night then in the morning the toothpaste is all over the cap,nasty."
4.00,"This toothpaste worked really well, it helped keep plaque off of my teeth throughout the day. My teeth had that just brushed feeling. I wasn't a fan of the taste or texture of the toothpaste, but I was a fan of the final product!"
1.00,"DON'T USE THIS! I used it for 2 days, a total of 3 times, but it's been awful since the first time.  I thought I was overreacting or that my mouth would get used to it, but my tongue feels burned and I haven't been able to taste anything in 2 days.  When I looked this up online, I didn't think I'd find anything but after seeing all these other negative reviews I'm really surprised that it's still on the shelf!  Horrible product."
5.00,"Love this product. I purchased the set and my mouth fill so fresh. Will be switching"
5.00,"This toothpaste made my teeth feel so clean and for a long time. I will definitely use it again and recommend to others."
5.00,"Love this left my teeth nice and clean, and gave me nice fresh breath!"
2.00,"My family & I love this product! However, the product tends to leak out of the tube! After several months of using this particular product & the waste(we lost more of the product than what was used) I would like to recommend a stand up tube! Not sure why the product leaks out of the tube, but the thought of wasting my money on a product I loved is no longer worth it! If you forget to close the tube, a new tube can/may last only a short period of time! I don't like scooping tooth paste out of a drawer or off the counter top! I will not longer purchase this particular brand again!!!"
5.00,"I love the way it makes you teeth feel like you just brushed them. Hours after you brushed."
4.00,"I really like the Pro Health. I think they taste good and makes my mouth feel clean."
1.00,"I used this mouthwash for the first time and it burned and hurt like hell. I thought it might have been because I used a lot of it, but the 2nd time I used it, which was a small amount, the same thing happened and I spit it out right away. I think it is the hydrogen peroxide in this stuff. Then looking at the reviews, I decided to return it to walmart the day after I bought it. They accepted my return even though I had already used it. This stuff is awful!! I can't believe Crest would make something like this. Back to Listerine Zero."
4.00,"Refreshing, alcohol free, and long lasting fresh breath. Not my favorite mouthwash of all time, but it's very good."
5.00,"Ever since I began using mouthwash on a daily basis nearly five years ago, I stopped getting painful chancre sores on the insides of my mouth. I would have to rinse with hydrogen peroxide until they healed and disappeared. I have used a variety of mouthwashes. The ones with alcohol burn my mouth. There is some speculation that using mouthwash with alcohol may contribute to gum cancer but several dentists whom I have spoken with said this isn't true. Nevertheless, the mouthwashes with alcohol do burn and irritate my mouth. Several years ago, I began using Crest 3D White Multi-Care Whitening Rinse Glamorous White, Fresh Mint [ ]. It doesn't have alcohol but it does have a tremendous amount of peroxide that is reputed to whiten one's teeth. I do think using the Crest 3D, along with my Philips Sonicare electric toothbrush ( ), helped decrease the number of cavities I've been having. However, the peroxide taste is very annoying to say the least. I believe the main reason I bought the Crest 3D was because the mouthwash is clear and wouldn't stain my vanity's countertop like other mouthwashes have, especially the bright blue ones. That is why I was always hesitant about buying the Crest Pro-Health Rinse. It has a bright blue color. The Amazon Vine Program was gracious enough to mail me a 1 liter bottle of Crest Pro-Health Rinse Complete, Fresh Mint. It doesn't contain alcohol or peroxide. The mint flavoring is pleasant and refreshing. I swish the mouthwash around my mouth for no more than thirty seconds to a minute before spitting out. The Crest Pro-Health doesn't stain my teeth like some mouthwashes have been reported to have done to customers. Also, its cap is easy to remove. I have arthritis in my fingers and have had difficulty removing the child-proof caps from the bottles of other mouthwashes. Also, I keep the Crest Pro-Health inside the bathroom's vanity. I won't let it sit on the marble countertop for fear that the deep blue mouthwash will permanently stain it like others have done. I've been using the Crest Pro-Health for over a week and haven't experienced any allergic reactions. I have not lost my sense of taste like some have reported when using other mouthwashes. Neither has there been any tingling or numbness around my mouth or jaw. I use this product as much as three times a day: once in the morning, once in the afternoon when I get home from work and plan to leave again, and once in the evening. If used only once, it is best to use it in the evening before going to bed. Because of its fluoride content, one shouldn't eat or drink within thirty minutes after using this mouthwash. I highly recommend using the Crest Pro-Health Rinse Complete, Fresh Mint, to anyone who wants to prevent cavities, chancre sores, gum disease, and bad breath. Using mouth wash also kills harmful germs and decreases one's chance of catching a cold or flu. Ever since I began using a mouthwash on a regular basis, I seldom catch a cold or flu. My advice is to buy a mouthwash that you will enjoy USING because, in order for it to work properly, you will need to actually USE it. Make it a part of you daily regiment. I always floss and rinse after brushing. In this way, I never forget. As busy as I am, I don't have time to ask myself if I have already flossed or brushed that day. Joseph B. Hoyos"
4.00,"I would definitely recommend this toothpaste because I have tried dozens of different toothpastes and this one has the most benefits overall."
4.00,"Loved how fresh my teeth felt after I was done brushing them!"
4.00,"This is a great product that gets your teeth super clean and feeling clean too!"
5.00,"I love the simple things. The texture, the foam, the taste, and of course the clean feeling. This tooth paste passed all of the factors for me and I would definitely purchase this is the future."
1.00,"What a mess this toothpaste is! DO NOT BUY IT!!!! The cap doesn't work correctly - design error - and so either you have to stand the tube upright or clean up a sticky mess in the morning. Lame!!!!"
5.00,"Love the toothpaste. It makes my mouth feel tingly and clean."
5.00,"I've used Crest mouthwash for several years now and found it to offer the best balance between strength and taste. The taste is a very nice mint - not too minty. The strength is medium strong without tasting too much like medicine, and most importantly, it has a little 'zing' without any burning sensation."
5.00,"not only does this toothpaste taste great, it left my mouth feeling clean a lot longer than my regular toothpaste. Made my teeth actually \"feel\" smooth and clean. Definitely recommend this."
4.00,"Definitely would use again, good texture and taste. Thanks vocal point!!"
5.00,"This toothpaste always leaves my mouth feeling so clean and fresh. That just brushed feeling seems to last longer, and I don't seem to spend as much time in the dentist's chair when it comes to cleaning. I would highly reccomend. A little pricier than normal tothpaste but I think it is worth it."
4.00,"I have found this Crest Pro-Health Clean Mint Toothpaste to be a refreshing gel paste. My mouth feels clean after brushing. The taste of the paste is somewhat sweet, but not too sweet. I might prefer a less sweet minty flavor for regular brushing. The tube is easy to use and does not get \"gunked\" or stuck for me, which is always nice in a toothpaste dispenser. For those who are familiar with Crest paste and prefer it, you will not likely be disappointed with this product."
4.00,"This makes your teeth feel really clean and your mouth feels fresh after using"
4.00,"I often feel like mouthwash is almost unneccessary as it only seems to work for 10 minutes. This mouthwash helped keep my breath fresh even after sleeping all night."
1.00,"this crest pro-health toothpaste was very pricey. Did a good job at giving your mouth a clean fresh feeling. But any other toothpaste can do that. Wasnt that thrilled and really didnt see any dramatic results. Still i am glad i got to try this. Than you vocalpoint and PG for the chance."
4.00,"Teeth felt fresh and clean after it's use. Felt like it got everything out/off my teeth."
5.00,"THE TOOTH PASTE SEEMS TO HELP MY TEETH STAY CLEAN AND THEY FEEL HEALTHY STRONGER THAN WITH MOST TOOTH PASTES I HAVE USED."
5.00,"Love this toothpaste. Iy makes my mouth feel clean."
5.00,"AWESOME TOOTHPASTE.It made my mouth feel refreshed."
4.00,"Was a bit curious how all the many different types of tooth pastes / gels. I thought they are all basically the same. I'll admit this particular one has a weird after taste but my mouth feels more clean than my previous standard pastes."
5.00,"Clean, sparkly and fresh - price is very reasonable. A good overall everyday dental plan for between dental visits. I will most certainly continue to use."
1.00,"I really thought when i clicked to read the reviews there was going to be a lot more who thought like I did. lol i guess not :( I recieved a sample of this quite some time ago and thought \"huh? it doesn't \"foam\" up when you are brushing your teeth?!\" so when i saw vocalpoint had samples available i figured id give it another try. And it still just wasnt right to me. I agree it is very \"runny\" and it doesnt change consistancy, to me, at all. I dont know if it was psychological but i didnt feel like i had even brushed my teeth when i was through brushing. And factoring in the price i see it around for...definately not worth it to me...someone who has realized likes bubbly toothpaste lol."
5.00,"My family uses all of these products and loves them. The tooth brushes are wonderful and hold up well! We have 4 children and they use them too (ages 8-13). I just wish they had 1 more color so we could all have different colors! The floss is amazing. My teeth are very weak so I have had a lot of dental work done,crowns and fillings and the floss works great. It doesn't get caught on my crowns where some other brands do. The tooth paste makes your teeth feel like you just had them cleaned at the dentist. We used the rinse and dont have anything negative to say about it either. All in all, these were great products!"
5.00,"i love this rinse! it leaves my mouth with an \"i've just been to the dentist feeling.\""
5.00,"I love crest and have used it since i was little, but this new one paired with the clinical toothbrush is a clean feel all around!"
1.00,"This product shouldn't be permitted on shelves. My brother passed it along to me after he realized he was having adverse reactions from the paste. Not only does it taste horrendous, but it burns my tongue and leaves a disgusting gooey residue in my mouth. I'm not sure if the film is from the paste or is created by the paste. Regardless, this product will go right in the waste bin and I will return to Sensodyne. Avoid this toothpaste like the plague!"
5.00,"I bought the toothpaste a few weeks ago and have been using it ever since. I noticed immediate results (teeth felt smoother) but the long term results have been even better. My teeth and gums feel much cleaner and smoother!"
4.00,"Some people don't think there's much of a difference between brands of toothpaste. I sometimes agree, but sometimes a certain variety and brand really do make a difference. I liked the way my teeth felt after brushing with this toothpaste. Clean, tingly, uh do I need a dentist? Maybe I still need to go, but maybe it won't be as bad when I do. Great product overall!"
1.00,"Alright, so, unlike some people, I only used this stuff for two days before I figured to check online for reviews. Apparently, a lot of the Crest Pro Health line has caused numerous problems in consumers. Chemical burns, losing some to all sense of taste, teeth turning brown, among other problems. Personally, I found out things were bad when I ate some buffalo wings. Medium spiciness tasted like my mouth was literally on fire, and other foods didn't taste like how I remembered. Ended up dumping the rest of the bottle down the drain. My gums are sensitive and just feel odd in general and I have mild blistering on the inside of my cheeks. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone, and it's the last Crest product I buy. If I could give it 0 stars, I most certainly would."
5.00,"This mouthwash works great and doesn't burn my sensitive mouth as much as some other brands do. Feels fresh and clean!"
5.00,"In my household we love the Crest Pro Health line. We use mostly the tooth paste and mouth wash. I have tried the plaque past as that is my area of concern. I am obsessed with teet and truly enjoy this great product."
4.00,"I started using the ProHealth toothpaste immediately, and strongly believe it works better than \"just another toothpaste\"!"
5.00,"I loved the product, the taste was good and the results are even better."
5.00,"Crest is my favorite toothpaste. Although I would use the Pro-Health brand again, 3D white is my favorite for texture and overall cleanliness!"
4.00,"I was a bit apprehensive about this product but my boyfriend and I decided to give it a try. We really liked the way it made our mouths feel cleaner than usual. It also left our mouths feeling very refreshed. I would recommend this product."
4.00,"My child loves this toothpaste, has made brushing exciting to him and the price is very good. I highly recommend."
3.00,"I hate mouthwash that is too strong tasting. This Crest clinical mouthwash tastes good and really feels like it is working. Makes my mouth feel clean and healthy."
5.00,"I love Crest Pro Health Toothpaste. The toothpaste has a great taste and leaves your mouth feeling clean and fresh. I swithched to Crest Health after using another toothpaste. Crest Pro Health gives you that same feeling each day that you get every six month after you leave the dentist office. I would highly recommend Crest Pro Health to others."
2.00,"This is a green, gel-like toothpaste - I say gel-like, because it is like a gel blended with the signature chalky texture of just about every other crest toothpaste. This one comes with stannous fluoride, the one that can temporarily stain, but that is because this is for sensitive teeth. My dislike of this product is not because I do not have sensitive teeth, but rather because after a good thorough brushing, my teeth do not feel as silky smooth as when I use various other toothpastes. Also, this had that absorbing characteristic of other Crest Pro-Health products that I have tried, and I find its lasting sensation unpleasant. For sensitive teeth, stannous fluoride toothpastes seem to be the norm. I prefer the flavor of Crest's white goop toothpastes better."
4.00,"My son really liked the taste and feel of the toothpaste and says he will use it again."
2.00,"I couldn't get past the taste this product left in my mouth, it was nasty. It also left a \"film\" feeling in my mouth and the bad taste lingered. Positive was the packaging was nice but I disliked the taste so much I had my husband try it and he didn't like it so I threw it away."
3.00,"But I prefer toothpaste with baking soda and peroxide."
5.00,"I purchased a 7.8 oz tube of this in store at Walmart for $3.47 6/16/13 as my other brand (Colgate Sensitive Multiprotection - maximum strength) was too expensive here. I mostly have used butler brand for many years as it was the cheapest. I could not find butler so went with the next best price for the buck which was this. It does sting your mouth, but they all sting, this one is no worse in my opinion, and it doesn't bother me at all unless I leave it in too long (which I do sometimes to get the best effect from the numbing compound). I've been using sensitive toothpastes for many, many years now and this one in my opinion worked much better than all the rest. I can't tell if the whitening is working, but I have a feeling it's most likely not.. as it takes much more than just a simple toothpaste to really whiten teeth. The shield it says it has to protect teeth to me is a really nice plus that most other brands do not have, and it makes me feel my teeth are being protected (kind of a nice feeling). I don't get any film on my lips or anything like that other reviewers have mentioned, so I don't understand what they are talking about. Sometimes the mint taste can be what is stinging, so others who are having issues may want to find a more neutral flavoring (if there even is one). This toothpaste also protects against gingivitis, plaque, cavities, and tartar; can't beat that. I love the large flat top popup cap on it, as it makes it stand straight up saving counter space. Overall, I really like this product and hopefully it stays in my price budget, because I'd like to keep using it till the day I die or have to have falsies."
5.00,"I LIKE THE TASTE OF THIS TOOTPASTE AND MY MOUTH FEELS VERY CLEAN AFTER USING IT. MY DENTIST HAS NOTICED AN IMPROVEMENT IN MY TEETH ."
5.00,"This really does a great job - my teeth felt fresh and really clean after using it. Good taste and overall, a good toothpaste!"
4.00,"Will keep buying this product and will recommend it to everyone I know."
4.00,"Loved the taste but didn't notice improved whiteness."
4.00,"This toothpaste is great! Works well and good value!"
5.00,"I like the way these bristles are soft yet sturdy enough to thoroughly clean my teeth."
4.00,"I really loved how this toothpaste cleaned my teeth and made them feel. It has a great taste and really helps get stains off your teeth."
5.00,"I loved the feeling of intense clean after using this toothpaste. The fresh, clean feeling lasted a long time and made me feel as though I was doing a great job at caring for myself."
4.00,"I was very pleased in the performance of this product. My mouth felt fresh and clean (like I had already used a mouth wash) and I left the house feeling confident for the day. I use an electronic toothbrush and this product worked great! I have since purchased this product for my family - another great thing.. my kids don't think it's \"too hot\" to use."
5.00,"I love Crest! There products just keep getting better and better! My teeth felt super clean after using it! Thanks Crest!"
5.00,"Crest Pro Health leaves my mouth feeling dentist clean and leaves my teeth whiter. It also helps keep my breath fresher longer than other toothpastes I've used. I love it!!"
4.00,"i was shocked with this product, i mean, i really works! only bad thing is the aftertaste, but i'll definitely will continue to use this mouthwash."
4.00,"The toothpaste really did leave me with a feeling of 'extra clean'. Although a bit pricey, the coupon I used helped justify my purchase."
5.00,"Crest products are always great and Crest Pro-Health really makes your teeth and mouth feel clean. It also has a very pleasant taste, a must try!"
4.00,"I think the product worked good. It is a little out of my price range but I will consider purchasing."
4.00,"Love this product, but am a bit concerned about the gritty brushing. I'm guessing it doesn't wear down enamel. Just a slight concern. Otherwise, love this product!"
5.00,"My family really enjoyed this toothpaste. It tasted great and our mouths felt fresh and clean afterward. It also seemed to whiten better than most toothpastes we've tried."
5.00,"I love crest toothpaste, especially The Crest Pro Health. I feel like I just left the dentist after using it."
4.00,"I really loved how clean this toothpaste made my mouth feel. I have a horrible problem with plaque because of some dental problems and this really made my teeth feel clean. I haven't been to the dentist yet but I will be real interested in what he has to say when I do see him."
2.00,"Crest is a great product but this product was harsh on the mouth and teeth if you have sensitive teeth."
5.00,"i used the crest gum care and i love it i had receeding gums it said you can feel a difference in 4 weeks and i actually started to see a difference in a couple of days i dint have the bleeding gums.I recommend this product its amazing"
1.00,"I never thought I'd have to write a negative review of a toothpaste...I mean, you think it's a toothpaste after all from a reputable company, how bad could it really be?Initially when I was using it, I completely freaked out looking in the mirror after rinsing my mouth and saw terrible brown stains all over my teeth. As a young woman, I didn't know what had just happened,... as my teeth went from pearly white to mottled brown in a short time. I didn't know initially where the stains came from, but I was horrified, and thought an emergency visit to the dentist was needed (as I couldn't go out of the house otherwise). I know this all sounds dramatic-- but I'm not exaggerating-- it's just that it was THAT bad. If you don't believe this... Google 'Crest Pro-Health toothpaste and stains' and see the numerous customer complaints.For the next few days, as I continued to use the paste (not knowing what was happening), I also noticed that some slimy rubbery stuff was all over my lips and inside my mouth. I kept having to pick it out of my mouth throughout the day, and I didn't know what the heck that was. I started realizing shortly later that the white slimy/rubbery stuff was actually the insides of my cheek coming off in layers. Panicking, I told my mother about this (who is a physician). I told her I thought I might have gotten some disease in my mouth. She told me \"It's the toothpaste!\" She was having similar problems after using Crest Pro-Health toothpaste, which cleared up after she stopped.Sure enough, after I stopped use of the toothpaste, the insides of my cheeks stopping coming off and there weren't any more stains. Thank goodness! I can't believe this product isn't revoked from the market entirely, and the company doesn't make amends to people who have used this product.UPDATE (Feb 2008): I see that many people have listed this review as 'unhelpful'. I'm surprised, because I put a lot of effort into my reviews to help other people. Rather than assuming that my story is too far fetched to actually be true, why not simply do a quick google search on Crest Pro Health stains? You'll see MANY people who've had similar horror stories. Obviously not everyone has problems... many people are happy with the product. But since there are so many complaints, if you haven't tried it yet-- why not pick a product that doesn't have so many complaints? There are so many other toothpastes to choose from. Also, many other customers have written about the 'mouth-slime' skin-peeling effect on the other Crest Pro Health product page here at Amazon: Crest Pro Health Toothpaste, Clean MintI have nothing to gain from sharing my story, as it's not like I am the CEO of a competitor toothpaste company. I am simply giving of my own time to write this review to spare others the anxiety that I went through!"
5.00,"Like the flavor, Crest is always a solid purchase option. Purchased this to get to $25 for free shipping. Would recommend."
1.00,"Almost immediately after using this product, I noticed really ugly brown stains on my teeth - made my teeth look like 100 year old dentures.  I made mention of these new stains when I saw my dental hygienist.  After a few basic health questions, she asked if I used Pro Health products, and I said I started using the Pro Health Rinse about 6 months ago.  That is exactly when the stains started appearing.  She proceeded to tell me that the Pro Health rinse is the bane of her existence. Apparently, many people have the same problem.                                                                     Pro Health Rinse leaves a film on the teeth that is easily stained.                                                                     Contrary to the warning on the bottle, these stains ARE NOT easy to get off.  My hygienist had to really work hard at getting the stains out, and it was not pleasant.                                                                     I would not recommend this product.  In fact, mine's going down the drain."
4.00,"Have used this product for a few weeks and found it to be refrehing and lasting all day."
4.00,"The Crest Pro-Health toothpaste was great. Although I didn't feel like I had just left the Dentist. It did what it was supposed to do, and left my mouth feeling minty-clean!"
4.00,"I'm a big fan of Crest so I was interested in trying out a toothpaste for ages 50+. I suppose that's just a marketing tag to compete with products like Sensodyne as anyone with sensitive gums who is younger than 50 might like this product as well. I'm used to gel toothpastes with a strong mint taste. This consistency is more pasty that what I'm used to and it has a gritty texture to it. Actually it reminds me of the toothpaste that my dentist uses for his patients after cleanings so for me the grit makes me think this toothpaste might cleanse more. I haven't used it long enough to confirm that but it's a positive for me. The \"smooth mint\" taste is a little mild for me though it doesn't linger so if you don't like a heavy flavor or any residual taste in your mouth that too would be a positive. All-in-all I'd recommend this toothpaste to anyone with sensitive teeth or gums but with the expectation that the consistency and flavor may be somewhat different from that of the products they are using now."
5.00,"I have been using crest for many years and this new Clinical line is just as amazing as I expected it to be. I will Forever be a Crest fan."
4.00,"I have had a problem with yellow teeth for a few years and I have tried several products including using baking soda because I heard it would work, I decided to give crest pro white a try , its amazing!"
5.00,"I love the feel of a clean mouth and crest really does the job!"
1.00,"I am only giving one star as it won't let me give a 'zero' rating. I started using this thinking that I would be doing my gums and mouth a favor. NOT! I used it for awhile and noticed that my tongue started getting a white coating on it. I have gastro tummy issues so naturally I thought that my stomach was having some gastritis problems as sometimes a coating on the tongue will be a result of that. So, naively I used this toothpaste night and day thinking that it would help my problem. After awhile, it was instantaneous, I started getting these strands of a thick white mucous type of 'glob' (best I can describe it) along the sides of my tongue that would goop up and I would literally have to grab it and take it off of my tongue. It was GROSS! Then I started getting white strings of 'whatever' from the insides of my top and bottom lips, the inside of my cheeks and even my lips themselves. Well, I kept brushing and was making sure I was using this toothpaste as I just knew it would help. About a week ago, I noticed that my white tongue started turning a light grey color and it burned a little and I woke up every morning with THE most HORRID taste in my mouth. It was indescribable, it was that bad. Severe dry mouth; horrid taste; grey tongue. THEN, just when I thought it couldn't get any worse, my teeth looked really dingy and like a taupe color...a light brown tint to them. Not spots of staining but my whole tooth. I didn't know what was going on...it was starting to freak me out. I don't have the money to go to the dentist! So I started 'searching' and everything started coming up with Crest Pro Health Toothpaste. I have seen site after site; page upon page of people having the same experience. I searched the active ingredient in Pro Health and it is Stannous Fluoride. This chemical causes all of the above side effects...all of them! I immediately went back to the regular Crest Clean Mint Toothpaste I used before and I IMMEDIATELY felt and saw a difference. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone!!!! For the life of me, I do NOT understand how this toothpaste can even be on the market! It should be removed immediately!! DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT - trust me, it may take awhile, but you, too, will be sorry."
1.00,"I've been using this product for about 3 months now. Morning and night daily basis. I've noticed that the between my teeth have browned! I freaked out and searched what could have darken my teeth, and many people claimed that crest pro health mouth wash browned their teeth. I can't only think of any other reason other than that it is crest pro health mouth wash. I have same daily routine except using the pro health mouth wash for last 3 months. It sounded like such a great option how it didn't have alcohol it in but it was the most horrible decision to buy one, also it always numb your taste after rinsing with this mouthwash."
4.00,"I tried the Crest ProHealth Plaque Control toothpaste. It made my teeth feel very clean and smooth. The taste was pleasant. I would recommend it."
5.00,"Like the way my mouth feels after brushing with this tpootpast."
5.00,"I really enjoyed this toothpaste. The flavor was not overpowering, and it left my teeth feeling cleaner than \"regular\" toothpastes."
5.00,"I love the Pro-Health line from Crest. The flavor and the way it makes my teeth feel. I wish the price point was a bit lower."
1.00,"Doing research on some of the problems this toothpaste has caused me led to the amazon reviews and everything described in all 56 negative reviews is what I have also endured. The most surprising discovery was how long these complaints have been posted on amazon and yet this revolting toothpaste still exists to harm consumers. What an abysmal product. Stay away from it."
4.00,"A bit expensive for toothpaste - but it tasted fine."
5.00,"Great. Makes my mouth feel clean. Very pleased with this product. Used this tooth paste daily."
5.00,"Love this toothpaste it made my teeth feel super clean"
5.00,"THis product has brightend my teeth. It makes my teeth feel clean."
5.00,"My mouth felt clean and fresh after using Crest Pro Health Clinical toothpaste. I have sensitive teeth and there was no irritation during or after using it."
5.00,"The Crest mouthwash left a wonderful clean, fresh feeling. Would definately recommend"
4.00,"It is refreshing and leaves teeth feeling clean. The taste is a nice mint."
4.00,"Loved the taste, felt clean and noticed some whitening. I'll use it again!"
1.00,"After two days of using this product, I developed a painful rash in my lower lip and under my tongue. It felt like a cluster of canker sores at first, but after four days of it not getting better, I realized it was a reaction to this toothpaste. What trash!"
5.00,"This is a great toothpaste. It leaves your teeth feeling fresh and clean after use."
5.00,"I love the Crest Professional line of products. I have been using Crest for several years now, and my dental checkups have gone smoothly. I use the paste and the Glide floss."
5.00,"I like this toothpaste a lot. It has great flavor and makes my teeth feel clean."
5.00,"I didn't receive the coupons for this product, but vocalpoint kept asking for a review. I do love this product and use it often. The only complaint I have is that is make the skin on the inside of my mouth peel off every time I use it, but it does a great job at cleaning my teeth."
5.00,"I loved using this toothpaste. It got my my mouth refreshingly clean."
5.00,"The product package is smaller than what I expected, but the quality of the toothpaste is great. I have been using this series of Crest products for a few months and feeling great so far."
3.00,"I love the toothpaste but the cap is too MESSY! I won't pay a premuim price to have a messy tube of toothpaste."
4.00,"I love the Crest Pro-Health Toothpaste. I love the super clean feeling that I have when I'm done. Feels like I've just had a cleaning at the dentist! I would love to try in a different flavor. I feel like it removes more plaque than my old brand, but feel that the plaque returns sooner than with the old brand. Still, will continue using the Pro-Health series from now on!!!"
5.00,"Tried the toothpaste and i would recommend it. Really freshened my breath, not to mention helped to whitened my teeth."
5.00,"Crest mouthwash is highly recommended in the excellent book Kiss Your Dentist Goodbye: A Do-It-Yourself Mouth Care System for Healthy, Clean Gums and Teeth. That book deals rather harshly with the dental profession, even though it's written by a dentist. The crest mouthwashes have the highest available amount of fluoride, which is what you want in a mouthwash. Be aware though that not all Crest mouthwashes contain fluoride, but this one does. This is pleasant to use, without the burning sensation that some mouthwashes have. It does a great job of fresheniong the breath, something that, as someone who is in sales, is important to me. In addition, this is a good big bottle and it's a great price. This should last a long time. I alternate this one with Closys Alcohol-Free Mouthwash, With Flavor Control, 32 Fluid Ounce (946 ml) (Pack of 2)That one doesn't have fluoride, but it does have a nuclear blast of a chemical ingredient that kills any living organism in the mouth. Between the two of these, I haven't had any dental problems for many years."
5.00,"I was looking for a decently priced tooth paste that was prime eligible. I am the lazy type that avoids brick and mortar stores because the crowds around my city are just awful. This was the best value that was prime eligible, so I hopped on it not really knowing what to expect. I was just looking for some no frills toothpaste that was cheap, but this ended up being the best toothpaste I have every used. It makes your teeth feel really clean and it tastes pleasant. One of the neatest things I noticed about it though is that you can eat right after brushing and the toothpaste does not affect the flavor of the food. Even better, once you are done eating the minty freshness of the tooth paste keeps your breath fresh. I am not sure how the managed to do this, but it was a very pleasant surprise."
5.00,"This product makes my teeth feel clean even after 12hrs after using it"
5.00,"This product kept my breath fresh and I love that it has whitening agents for long term dental health."
4.00,"Crest has always put out a good product. I have been using their tooth paste in various forms for many, many years and have always been happy and this tooth paste is no exception. I like the taste, it does a good job of cleaning my teeth, what more can I say. I'm a happy camper with this product and will continue to use Crest as it gets the job done."
5.00,"I love this Crest Pro-Health plaque fighter toothpaste. It worked to help remove plaque build-up after two brushes in the same day! I love the fact that it is a toothpaste that can work in this one area to control plaque. This toothpaste gave me a clean, fresh, rejuvenated mouth which I had been fighting for some time. This is the toothpaste for my teeth!"
5.00,"The crest whitening products boast a whiter smile in seven days. I decided to use in conjunction with the. The idea of doing something I do every day anyway to whiten my smile seemed like a winner to me.The taste of this toothpaste is pretty good, but the texture is really strange. It's VERY gritty. I felt like I was sandblasting my way to a whiter smile.I have to admit, I was a little shocked by the fact that my teeth actually did look whiter after ten days of use. (see photo) Even if it didn't whiten my teeth, it tastes okay so I would go ahead and finish the tube, unlike the mouthwash, which is kind of gross."
4.00,"I really liked the Pro-Health Rinse, it left my mouth feeling very clean without the sting that some other mouth washes have!"
5.00,"I think this is a very good oral/mouth product. I do recommend using Crest mouth wash that whitens the teeth."
1.00,"I have used various Crest toothpastes/gels for years without any problem. However, when I began using the Crest Pro Health toothpaste my throat was sore and the back of my tongue was somewhat swollen. After visiting my doctor and an ENT they finally decided that I should try another toothpaste because I was likely allergic to Crest Pro Health. After switching to a different Crest toothpaste (a less fancy gel), I no longer had any problems. I hope someone at Procter and Gamble does some tests to find out why many people (including myself) are having an allergic reaction to this toothpaste. This may be great toothpaste for some people, but my suggestion is to buy a different product!"
5.00,"I loved the feel of my teeth after I brushed my teeth. My mouth feels so fresh and clean."
4.00,"I liked the way it made me teeth and mouth feel after I used it, but I do not like the texture of the paste."
4.00,"I did like this toothpaste and it cleaned my teeth really well. At first it left a funny feeling on my tongue kinda like a coating but after a few uses I got used to it and I like the product overall."
5.00,"I love the way the plaque control makes your teeth feel after brushing. It cleans your teeth without harming the enamel."
4.00,"I think this is a great product that gave my mouth a fresh scent for a good portion of the day. After a period of about a week I could tell that there was a lower build up of plaque on my back teeth, as well."
4.00,"I like how the toothpaste made my teeth feel so clean! It did feel like a better clean than \"regular\" toothpaste. I wasn't wowed by the flavor, though, but will try another variety."
4.00,"I thought it was pretty good for a toothpaste- got the job done, and I think it helps keep teeth healthy. I must say that it's kind of hard to tell, but I thought it was as good as other kinds!"
5.00,"This toothbrush gets my teeth super clean. I love it!"
4.00,"This product leaves a clean taste in your mouth that makes me feel like it is doing a great job killing the germs in my mouth."
5.00,"I was leery at first about the \"clinical\" part of the name. I thought it would be more of a medicinal tasting product. Boy was I wrong, thank goodness! It leaves your breath fresh and clean, no medicine aftertaste either.My son loves it, and normally would only use kiddy mouthwash. Great product!"
4.00,"I like how my teeth and mouth felt clean longer with this tooth paste."
4.00,"This works well, cost is a little high, but all around good rinse!"
1.00,"This toothpaste tastes terrible. The mint flavor is the worst. Cinnamon is still pretty bad but slightly better than the mint."
3.00,"I really liked the flavor of this toothpaste. My teeth and mouth felt very clean after the first use. The only thing I didnt like was the fact that it didnt really foam up alot. Probably all in my mind but I feel like toothpaste does a better job when it foams up."
4.00,"It was only after trying this toothpaste that I really looked at the box and accompanying information about it. Namely that it is designed for conditions that people 50 and older experience. While it's nice that they are thinking of that segment of the population, with how the branding is, and the box is laid out it could make people (like me) who are not that segment pass up the product. If I see something that says \"For 50 and up\" and I am not 50, then logically there is no benefit to me right? So, with that said how is the toothpaste? Not bad actually. It's definitely got a rather strong mint flavor. Not over powering but it's there for sure. Seemed to do a good job of cleaning my teeth. However, it didn't really feel like it \"foamed\" up very much either. Maybe I am used to toothpaste with a higher \"foam factor\". It could also be that it is specifically designed like that to help combat the conditions in the +50 crowd. I'm not sure. At the end of the day I neither liked, nor disliked it, in contrast to other toothpastes I have tried. Like I said before I am not the target crowd for this toothpaste, but I don't think it would hurt others to use it. It did its job for me, that's all I can really ask for."
5.00,"crest has been around for a long time and I can see why. They are consistently making great products. This product makes my teeth feel nice and clean."
1.00,"I purchased this last weekend after my most recent checkup and on the advice of my dentist - who recommended this specific brand. After one day of using this (morning and night, following the directions), I woke up the next morning and couldn't taste my breakfast. It almost felt like there was a slight coating on my tongue. I though that it might be just a matter of getting used to it for a day or two, so I kept using it. By yesterday evening, after 4.5 days of using it, I was starting to worry about it, so I googled \"crest pro-health complete sense of taste\". I found numerous blog posts and these reviews on Amazon. So, I stopped using it yesterday (9/26/12) and will take it back to our local Kroger for a refund. Looking around here at the other mouthwashes that claim to restore enamel, the only one with more than 10 reviews that received good ratings is , so that is what I will try next. I hate to post negative things about my hometown company (Procter & Gamble), but this product is defective and should never have received FDA approval, going by the negative amount of comments I have seen on the internet. I'm hopeful my sense of taste will come back soon, and will post an update so people know how long it takes. I joked with my wife last night that when we were eating taco salad (with ground beef) that I might as well have put cat food on my salad because it would have tasted the same. UPDATE: Two days after I stopped using it I started getting a sense of taste back. I noticed I could taste a little bit (maybe 50% normal) and by the end of the following day it was back to normal. Phew!"
5.00,"When I used this product I felt cleaner with whiter teeth."
5.00,"Wintergreen mouthwashes always suit me better than the various mint flavors that come in blue rinses. I don't think this flavor is too different from any wintergreen product that doesn't contain sugar or the artificial sugars in many mints.This mouthwash makes me mouth feel clean, doesn't burn, and still manages to provide a bit of a tingle. I have used the various other Prohealth rinses off and on for years and my teeth are no more stained than they ever were...and this is with copious coffee and tea drinking.In short, I love the mixing of the alcohol free prohealth mouthwash with a crispy wintergreen flavor."
4.00,"The Crest Pro-Health Clean Mint Toothpaste has a nice mild flavor that the whole family liked. It seems to clean our teeth like the usual toothpaste. There is nothing unique about this product. It works and tastes good. I prefer Colgate brand for whiter teeth."
5.00,"I love this product. The minty flavor is not too much, but leaves your breath fresh. The paste itself seems to almost foam while you are brushing getting the plaque and buildup that are lingering around your gums and teeth. After brushing, teeth feel silky smooth and clean, just like coming from the dentist. I use mouthwash all the time, but this product almost gave me mouthwash clean mouth feel in one product. Will definitely recommend and purchase again in the future!"
4.00,"This oral rinse took me a couple times to get used to. Because it has no alcohol and has hydrogen peroxide, the taste and feeling are different than any mouth rinse we have tried before. But the more we use it, the more we like it. It makes my mouth and teeth feel clean."
4.00,"I've tried 3 Crest Mouthwashes in the last month and this one is definitely the best. The wintergreen taste was appealing to everyone in the family that uses mouthwash, and I found that the fresh feeling lasted for a very long time.The best part about this mouthwash for my family is that it doesn't have alcohol. Thus this bottle is going in the children's bathroom. Not that they would be stupid enough to drink mouthwash, but currently my daughter is on medication where any form of alcohol is best avoided."
4.00,"I have been using this toothpaste for a while now. I didn't see a dentist before using this product for my teeth to be cleaned so not sure about the claim on keeping the 'dentist clean'. Overall I like this toothpaste, and would recommend it."
5.00,"My go-to toothpaste. Never leaves a bad taste and keeps my mouth feeling fresh. I don't like Colgate because of the taste that it leaves."
1.00,"Ever since I started using this toothpaste, my teeth hurt. At first I thought it was because I drank too much soda that day. But now it has gotten to the point that as soon as I brush the paste over my teeth, I feel the pain. I use a sensitivity toothpaste once a day and a non-sensitivity toothpaste during other times of the day. I haven't had any sensitivity until I started using Crest Pro-Health. It has to do with the ingredients in the toothpaste."
4.00,"Before this toothpaste, I was using one with a very dull taste. That may play a part in my opinion of this toothpaste, but I LOVED the minty flavor. My mouth just feels a whole lot cleaner. The price makes it a bit less appealing, but it's a great quality product."
5.00,"I love this new Crest toothpaste! I've always been a fan of Crest oral care products and this one is another winner. My teeth felt so clean and smooth, after the first use. And each subsequent use produces results that are even better. Thank you Crest and thank you Vocalpoint."
5.00,"I thought this product was amazing so I switched to this."
5.00,"Crest Pro-Health toothpastes aren't any old toothpaste. They've changed the form of flouride in the mix, which makes it far more effective at protecting against gum disease (and maybe dental caries). The only downside: It tastes a little odd and has a slightly gritty texture. Worth getting used to..."
4.00,"This toothpaste worked well and left my mouth feeling clean and fresh, not gritty like some toothpastes."
5.00,"It leaves your teeth feeling so nice, clean and fresh."
4.00,"I like the mouthwash okay, but the taste is not particularly my favorite of all mouthwashes. It has an odd taste. I have not seen a difference with my teeth looking any whiter. I will keep trying it for awhile to give it a chance. My teeth do feel clean after rinsing with it."
5.00,"Great deal on this bulk item. Can't beat the price at my local stores and free shipping is just what I wanted. Did not have to brave the crowds to get it. Best whitening toothpaste I have ever found anywhere. Works better than all the high dollar ones!"
4.00,"My daughter unfortunately is having a slow process stopping to smoke but loves this mouthwash. It has helped keep her teeth white and her breath fresh!"
5.00,"I have used a prescription mouthwash for the last two years and my hygenist has told me this mouthwash will do the trick (at half the price!). It tastes a lot better therefore I feel like my breath is better."
5.00,"I really liked this toothpaste. Made my teeth feel clean for quite a while after using it and it had a great taste."
5.00,"I used the mouth wash. I felt that it did not burn like some I have used. I also liked the way it made my teeth & mouth feel. I definitely would buy these again with a good coupon."
4.00,"Makes my teeth feel squeaky clean...love that about this product. I plan on getting a tube for my husband to use."
5.00,"Loved this mouthwash, I'm always excited to try things made by Crest Pro Health, it's the best I've tried."
1.00,"I have been using this mouthwash for a while now, and my tongue is completely numb.  I have also lost much of my sense of taste.  I have been racking my brain as to the problem, and realized that the problem started with the use of this product.  I went online and discovered others posting the same complaint. I am discontinuing the use of this product immediately.  I just hope the feeling returns to my tongue as well as my sense of taste.                                              I would give it O stars if possible"
5.00,"I really enjoyed the taste of this toothpaste. It gave me a slick clean feeling like a dentist's cleaning."
2.00,"I tried this mouthwash and it has good flavor, smell good but it left a film in my mouth that wasn't very nice, everything I ate after using the mouth wash tasted nasty."
3.00,"I don't like the taste of this toothpaste at all. And it leaves a film in my mouth that I don't like."
4.00,"worked well, freshened breath, not sure if it whitens"
4.00,"it did its job felt good and made my teeth feel clean :)"
5.00,"I so love crest pro health. My husband and i have been using it for about 4months because his dentist recommended that he use it.. and we bought 4 big tubes of it at the flee market for 4 for $7. Best $7 we every spent. I love the clean mint flavor because it do not have the very sweet after taste.. We also use the crest pro health mouth wash. I am giving this product a 5 star"
4.00,"Crest toothpaste has always been my number 1 go to toothpaste but this line leaves your teeth feeling cleaner than ever."
4.00,"Love how it makes your teeth and mouth feel clean."
4.00,"It was nice, but it felt a little too antiseptic in my mouth compared to what I'm used to. I'll stick to my old brand though."
5.00,"The flavor of the toothpaste is nice and the fresh clean taste in my mouth lasts for a long time."
5.00,"This is so much better than other mouthwashes. There's no weird taste or aftertaste to it. You just feel clean. Best of all, there's no alcohol so even my 4 year old can rinse with it."
4.00,"The only reason for taking the time to post is that I like Crest. Have been using it as long as my 55 year-old brain can remember. Furthermore, it is not a solution to officially tell people the flip-top is a twist-off. FIX THE CAP."
3.00,"I ordered this because I needed it, not because I was super excited about what it could do for me. Having tried it (not long-term, so I can't speak to the supposed whitening benefits, although I have my doubts about those), I can say - it's mouthwash! Nice crisp wintergreen flavor, tending towards overly sweet (but aren't they all), non-alcohol base (again, aren't they all alcohol free now?). If you use as much as they tell you to, you're going to cruise through this bottle in about a week, even if it's just you using it. And that, my friends, is a rip off, for what amounts to Splenda-water. Make your own mouthwash with peppermint oil. Save money."
5.00,"this had a nice flavor and didn't burn like some mouthwash. my mouth felt really fres"
5.00,"We love Crest products. These products were very effective and cleaned our teeth well."
4.00,"I love this toothpaste and have noticed that my teeth feel much cleaner. Overall it makes my mouth feel clean and fresh. A little pricey."
1.00,"Just like many of the other reviewers here, this product also stained my teeth. I didn't realize until my mom pointed it out to me.. I thought my brushing habits were causing it, but then I remembered the fine print on the back of the label. Avoid this product unless you want brown teeth!"
5.00,"Just LOVE it! Cleans teeth so well and leaves your mouth tingly clean!"
3.00,"I am not a fan of the Pro-Health products in general due to their unpleasant taste and filmy residue that they leave in your mouth. However this particular rinse is a bit better than some of the other rinses that I have tried. The rinse has a dark green color and the cool wintergreen flavor is good and it gives your mouth a tingly feeling when using it. My only problem with it is the film that it leaves on your mouth. It's supposed to leave a film on your mouth in order to protect your teeth by I don't like it. I like my mouth to feel clean and fresh not covered in a film. This rinse is ok and I will finish using the bottle but it wouldn't be my first choice for sure."
4.00,"This dental product line is obviously a higher quality product. My teeth feel clean, and well taken care of. I am using the entire line for all my dental needs and am finding that my mouth feels cleaner longer."
1.00,"So I decided to give this mouth wash a try and boy do I wish I had read it's reviews first! The first time I used it, it left a white filmy residue after rinsing, which wasn't anything I was too concerned with. I continued using it for a day or so and then noticed raw areas on the inside of my cheek followed by a swollen and painful gland or lymphnode. It was incredibly painful for an entire day! The next day the pain was gone, but it took a couple days for things to return to normal."
4.00,"Product is Great !! my mouth feels clean and fresh. On the down side it is very expensive. worht it if you have very sensitive teeth."
5.00,"This mouth rinse is wonderful! There isn't a harsh taste and it cleaned my mouth beautifully! Loved it!"
5.00,"This mouthwash left my mouth feeling very clean. The strong taste..let me know it is working"
5.00,"I no longer fear that I am missing something in the routine of brushing my teeth! Crest-Pro-Health adresses my gingivitis and gum sensitivity issues all in ONE toothpaste! It tastes great, leaves my mouth feeling clean and protected and gives me all the additional benefits that I have come to rely on from the Crest brand, such as plaque and tarter control, cavity protection and whitening. Crest has always been a brand I have trusted...so it doesn't surprise me that such a wonderful product would come from them!"
3.00,"Non-alcoholic mouth rinse that's pretty effective. I actually prefer one with alcohol (I don't find it too stinging) but if you are averse or unable to use one with that ingredient then this is your product."
5.00,"I've been looking for a great alternative to Listerine for months and I think I finally found it in Crest Clinical Rinse. My breath feels fresh for hours and my teeth feel cleaner than ever."
4.00,"The toothpaste has a slightly different flavor than most of the other brands but not displeasing. I do have an issue with the new flip cap being extremely messy. With a new tube on hand, I unscrew the cap instead of using the flip feature. This keeps the toothpaste from oozing out of the flip hinge and making a mess. I would rather see the old screw cap back, much neater."
5.00,"I love all the Crest clinical products! This toothpaste isn't overpoweringly minty like some others can be, and it really gets my teeth clean. No fuzzy slippers on the teeth after using this! Paired with the Glide floss and Crest mouthwash, you have a clean you can count on for hours! Thanks Crest!"
4.00,"Don't really have a plaque problem because I use a power brush and floss twice a day. But, this paste left my mouth feeling pretty clean and, if it cost a bit less, would use it more often."
5.00,"This product taste good and teeth really feel clean."
5.00,"I love the Crest Glide Floss because I get a deep down clean in between my very close together teeth. It dosen't shred or get stuck. Great product!"
1.00,"Okay, The first two rinses with this went quite well and were almost pleasant. But on third rinse I experienced of pain unlike any other mouthwash. My tongue feels like I scolded it on hot tea and the insides of my cheeks are burned in peeling. There's also a very weird tingly sensation in the joint of my jaw. So while yes my mouth is technically clean, I feel it is slight overkill to not only kill germs and bacteria but also all living tissue in your mouth."
4.00,"Loved this!! Very fresh feeling and taste and good price!"
5.00,"Absolutely love this product! Leaves your mouth feel fresh and clean!"
1.00,"I have always taken great care when it comes to my dental hygiene. For the past 40 years, all of my dentists have complimented me on how well I have taken care of my teeth. When I began using Crest Pro-Health mouthwash, it did leave an awful taste in my mouth for hours, and also seemed to take away my ability to taste things for at least six to eight hours. What really concerned me though was the accumulation in my mouth of a slimy, gooey white gunk which appeared as soon as I began using this mouthwash. This gunk would appear throughout my mouth, especially in the bottom of my gumlines, roof of my mouth, tongue, etc. I kept using it thinking my mouth had to adjust to this stuff but, after using it for two weeks, it never did--it just got worse. I stopped using it and all of the above problems immediately disappeared. Stupid me, I thought, well, I will give it one more try and sure enough, the same problems returned within hours. I used it off and on for the next month and noticed for the first time in my life that my teeth began turning slightly brown despite my not changing my dental hygiene in any way except for using this Crest mouthwash. I stopped using it again, and, like before, the problems immediately disappeard. However, this time I thoroughly research it on the interent, and found hundreds of comments from users like myself experiencing the same problems. IN SUMMARY; DIDN'T THE MANUFACTURER EVERY TEST THIS PRODUCT BEFORE PUTTING IT OUT ON THE MARKET? AFTER SEEING ALL THE NEGATIVE COMMENTS ABOUT THIS MOUTHWASH, ISN'T THE MANUFACTURER EVEN THE LEAST BIT CONCERNED? SOMETHING IS DEFINITELY WRONG WITH THIS MOUTHWASH, AND AT A MINIMUM, THE FDA SHOULD DEMAND IT BE REMOVED FROM STORE'S SHELVES UNTIL ADEQUATE TESTING CAN BE DONE. I CANNOT EMPHASIZE HOW MUCH I HATE THIS PRODUCT! DO NOT, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, USE THIS PRODUCT. RESEARCH IT A LITTLE BIT ON THE INTERNET AND THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS AND COMMENTS WILL ASTOUND YOU!"
5.00,"Enjoys this toothpaste! & that is something we rarely agree on."
4.00,"The crest mouthwash was a great product. I would recommend it to all my friends and family."
5.00,"This toothpaste felt amazing! My teeth felt so much cleaner than when using the other brand that I had been purchasing! Love Crest!"
4.00,"I'm a crest kid -- and consistenly buy Crest with Scope. I thought the Crest ProHealth was a great product - in line with all of Crest products and would recommend it. My favorite though is still their Crest with Scope!"
5.00,"With this line of products, I had never had my mouth feel so clean before using them. They all worked together to give me a fresh clean dentist feel, and I highly recommend using all them!"
1.00,"I used a little bit just to try out the flavor. The next day I had a little redness in the corner of my mouth. Didn't think anything of it. After a couple of days the little red mark stayed but didn't get worse. I finished my other mouthwash and started using this terrible stuff exclusively. Within a couple of days the little red corner tripled in size and then I got another one on the other side of my mouth. On top of that my gums would sting really bad when I used the mouthwash. I thought I was brushing too hard so I bought a softer toothbrush. Then I decided it might the toothpaste (even though I used the paste before I don't know why I jumped on that) so I bought some Tom's toothpaste. The pain in my gums got a little better but the rash or burn or whatever around my mouth persisted. Well, I stopped using this product a couple of days ago but after doing some research on it I'm pretty confident that this was the cause. Now my lips are very chapped and the corners are really dry, flaky and still red. There are even a couple of spots lower near my chin. I would never have even considered this product if I had read these reviews. Just save yourself the trouble and get something else."
5.00,"If you are a finniky consumer who wants the BEST for yourself and your family, there is simply no other toothpaste to buy than Crest. ProHealth feels great, and it leaves no residue. I would highly recommend this product."
4.00,"I was very impressed with the way my teeth felt when brushing my tongue against them"
1.00,"This was the worst tasting mouth rinse I have ever tried. It left a foul taste in my mouth and I could still taste it the next morning! I will be returning it to the store."
5.00,"Love this product. The only one my husband and I will use. It does not have a \"stingy\" after taste and cleans just as well as \"the other\" product. Highly Recommended."
4.00,"I love the way the toothpaste leaves your mouth feeling clean. THe taste is nice."
5.00,"When I went to the dentist the last time, they told me that my gums were as healthy as they could be — thanks to Crest! I plan on sticking with these products as part of my daily routine to keep my gums healthy."
5.00,"made my teeth feel clean and fresh all day, I would highly recommend"
4.00,"I really liked the way this product cleaned my teeth and made my mouth feel fresh, and it lasted almost all day. I would recommend this toothpaste to everyone."
4.00,"This product does what it says! This is brand that my family uses!"
1.00,"I started using this product and stopped using it in about a week. The product has a nice minty flavor and does make your mouth feel clean, however, it was not worth the problems it caused me. After I used the mouthwash, my tongue felt like I had burnt it on hot food. I couldn't taste food for several hours. At first I figured this was normal, that mint makes food taste \"different\" afterwards, but after a couple days I realized that I actually could not taste anything. My tongue felt numb, and it took a long time to go back to normal. I decided to google if other customers were experiencing this reaction. I was shocked to see that so many people had the same issue! After reading that some people experienced dark stains, I stopped using the product instantly. A couple days after I stopped using the product, I started having tooth sensitivity to hot and cold foods when I would eat on one side of my mouth! I was in severe pain whenever I would eat. I never had this problem before, and I have never had any cavities. I'm not sure if the sensitivity is related or if it is just a coincidence, but I've never had any tooth pain before I started using this product. I think the mouthwash was too strong for my gums and exposed the dentin on my teeth leading to the sensitivity. I would never buy this product again, it was too harsh for me."
5.00,"This is a product that I always get anyway - it has all the good stuff that others have, but such a better taste, with no alcohol (at least most of the varieties). Definitely prefer it over any other mouthwash. :)"
1.00,"After reading a lot of reviews about this product causing stains on teeth, I read the label- under 'other information' (conveniently, not under 'warnings'), the label states: \"products containing stannous fluoride [the active ingredient of this toothpaste] may produce surface staining of teeth.\"  Granted, the stains may be harmless, but I find the whole thing really creepy.  I am IMMEDIATELY throwing this product away."
5.00,"I have VERY sensitive teeth and a partially exposed root on one tooth. I've tried other sensitive toothpaste types and this one leaves my teeth feeling the cleanest, while also helping with my sensitivity. I no longer cringe when I bite into a cold piece of fruit or an ice cream bar. Plus, I feel that it is still helping to remove surface stains and keep my teeth white"
5.00,"I loved the way it made my mouth feel, so clean & fresh!"
1.00,"I bought the mouthwash without reading reviews on Amazon, terrible and tragic mistake. The stuff burnt my tongue at first use, 3 days later I still can't taste the food. As far as browning teeth goes, I don't want to stay and find out. I am lucky that my teeth color looks fine, for now. ==Update 1/29/2013=== I used this product 9 times. That was enough to put my tongue through every level of hell. First came the wonderful bruning sensation, followed by the usual taste lost, eventually I couldn't drink fluid at one point because it hurt too much. Then my lips chapped so bad that no amount of chapstick can fix. There were days my tongue hurt so much that it felt like there's hole in my tongue. I am glad to report I've now regained my taste and my tongue seems to be healed after stopped using this product for 10 days. As far as this mouthwash goes, it's a great toilet cleaning product. It kept my toilet shining and ordor free."
5.00,"This toothpaste does an excellent job cleaning your teeth with a nice mint taste. I really like all the Crest Clinical products."
4.00,"The toothpaste works great. My mouth feels fresh and clean."
5.00,"l loved the product. My mouth felt clean, fresh and revitalized. Would purchase again and recommend to family and friends!"
5.00,"Tastes great, feels great. Still a big fan of Crest."
5.00,"This is a good product.  The taste is spicy and refreshing, the amount required is minimal, and the container stands on its own if you want."
5.00,"This is a GREAT product! It made my mouth feel clean for much longer than other products we've tried! My husband loved it too!!"
5.00,"I love this new rinse. It made my teeth and mouth feel so much fresher! Actually made me feel like I had a much fresher mouth for a longer period of time. I will certainly continue buying this product."
1.00,"I couldn't understand it. The better my dental hygiene regimen got, the worse my mouth felt. My cheeks were burning and felt scaly and rough. I finally realized it happened right after using this mouthwash. I switched brands, and voila!, I feel fine again. If by \"clinical\" they mean \"will remove several layers of skin,\" then yes, it works as advertised. If you're looking for a gentle yet effective mouthwash, look elsewhere!"
5.00,"The Crest mouthwash really has my mouth feeling clean. It makes me feel like the bacteria is being killed. I love it./"
4.00,"Worked great! I would definitely buy this product again."
4.00,"I really like this mouthwash. It left my mouth feeling fresh longer than the other brand I was using."
5.00,"This is an excellent product. I can highly recommend the alcohol-free flavors. No burning--just crisp, fresh feeling."
4.00,"Great taste and leaves my mouth feeling fresh. My dentist said my gums have never looked healthier."
4.00,"Crest products worked great! My teeth and gums feel and look clean! Thank you!"
2.00,"I did not care for the aftertaste it left. It was not for me."
5.00,"i have finally found a tooth paste that i love! =) never going back to a different one!"
5.00,"I thought the toothpaste cleaned my teeth well. It was also affordable and tasted good."
4.00,"I liked it, it seemed to clean well. It left my mouth feeling very fresh and my teeth felt clean."
4.00,"I liked it but didn't feel the burn that I'm used to"
4.00,"I liked it! It left my mouth feeling fresh and Clean!"
5.00,"My teeth were so white..just loved it. I would recommend it to anyone wanting that fresh from the dentist clean feeling."
5.00,"Gave my mouth a very fresh feeling and nice breath all the while knowing it's good for my teeth!"
5.00,"I love this toothpaste!! I was very skeptical but after trying this product it worked great!! I have already changed to this toothpaste and am loving it!!! Thanks."
3.00,"We both love the Crest Prohealth mouthwash, however the new \"clinical\" version is way too foamy for us and has a bad after taste. We prefer the original \"blue\" Crest Prohealth mouthwash."
2.00,"I'm going to have to chime in with those who are concerned about the potential side effects of Crest Pro-Health. Ever since fluoride rinses have come onto the market, I've been meaning to add them to my daily regimen. As I've gotten older, I like to do whatever I can to protect my teeth and maintain good dental hygiene. So when I got the opportunity to try Crest Pro-Health, I was happy. I thought this would definitely be the impetus needed to get me moving forward with advanced protection and preventative treatment. So, I followed the directions:1) Use twice daily after brushing.2) Use for one minute of vigorous swishing.3) Don't eat of drink for thirty minutes thereafter.This rinse itself is powerful stuff. I know some others have complained about its strength and burn, but I actually don't mind that sensation. It makes me feel like it's doing some good. However, when I took a closer look at the product, I was pretty appalled to see the potential side effect warning. \"In some cases, rinses may cause surface staining to teeth. 6 in 1 benefits. This is not permanent or harmful, and may be prevented by adequate brushing or removed at your next dental visit.\"Thankfully, I noticed this early and I'm certainly terrified to keep using the rinse. This staining may affect only a small number of people, but the idea of having to go to the dentist because I used Crest Pro-Rinse is not something I'm willing to gamble with. No amount of positive benefit, for me, can outweigh the possibility of having to walk around with BLACK teeth! This didn't happen to me, but the risk isn't worth it. My personal experience wasn't negative (so 2 stars), but I'm not going to use this again. KGHarris, 3/13."
5.00,"If you like that dentist clean then this is the product for you. Your teeth actually feel clean without leaving a gritty feel to your teeth. It has a fresh taste that lasts a while."
5.00,"you do need to say alot about it because its actions dose just try it and you will buy it"
5.00,"I love the Pro Health Rinse. It makes my mouth feel so clean and refreshing. Also like the fact that it is a Crest product."
5.00,"I love all the crest products, they all work really well and leave your mouth in good health."
1.00,"this mouthwash caused several brown spots on my husband teeth only after a weak of using!!"
4.00,"This is a great product. The toothpaste not only tastes great but does a wonderful job cleaning my teeth."
5.00,"The Crest Pro- Health Mouthwash tastes good, is easy to rinse with and I like the foaming effect it produces. I would buy this product again. I like it a little better than other mouthwashes I have used in the past."
4.00,"I've always had faith in Crest, and this is just one more reason why. Great job Crest."
5.00,"I tried the Crest Pro Health mouthwash and I am extremely satisfied with the product. My mouth felt clean and fresh after every use. I believe that it did help make my mouth fresh and healthy."
5.00,"I tried the Crest Pro Health mouthwash sample along with the Pro Heath toothpaste that I bought. I am a serious coffee drinker so my teeth are always stained. Not only did this keep my teeth cleaner and fresher all day but I even noticed some whitening! I'll keep using these products from now on!"
5.00,"Great clean feeling left in my mouth! Not too strong and not too weak. Made my breath fresh and left my teeth feeling clean and well rinsed :)"
4.00,"Great after the dentist feel. love it!!! recommending to all my friends and family."
5.00,"I used this the one time then by the end of the day my mouth still felt clean. I immediately went to my local pharmacy and bought the entire Crest Pro-Health Clinical Series including the floss and the toothbrush. My husband agrees that we feel cleaner for a longer period of time. Definitely get it especially if you have sensitive teeth and you want to keep eating that ice cream this summer."
5.00,"I was skeptical that this product would whiten my teeth...but it did. And I also have sensitive teeth too..no bothering me."
5.00,"I am sold on Crest Pro-Health toothpaste, especially Clinical Plaque Control. It works as advertised and is worth the price."
5.00,"Truly clean and refreshing feeling after using. My sons truly enjoyed this toothpaste and teeth looks cleaner and brighter. Thumbs up on this one!"
4.00,"This was a very nice product. It left my mouth feeling fresh and clean."
5.00,"Great products that makes my mouth always feel so clean and fresh!"
1.00,"After just a day or so of use, I woke up in the morning and pulled out about 10 globs of white gunky slime from my mouth.. I was so terrified that I was getting moderate gingivitis or some other disease. So I started using it more frequently, only to find that the problem was worse. Mind you, I always have hated this toothpaste because of it's consistency and taste because it also leaves a HORRID aftertaste that will stay with you all day long.. but anyways, since I've never had numerous globs of white goo coming out of my mouth before, I was starting to freak out because they are nasty. I am just thankful I bumped into the right place on the internet. Some forum discussed a girl that had the same problem and someone asked if she was using Crest Pro Health toothpaste.. and she sure was, as well as many other people on the board that were shocked to find out the culprit! Needless to say, I immediately threw out the tube and I would rather not brush my teeth until I get a new kind than brush with this ever again.. Also, I honestly was noticing that my teeth were starting to look more dull and ..well.. nasty for a lack of a better word. I don't have brown spots to my knowledge yet, but I wasn't using the mouthwash and I think the people using the rinse suffered from brown spots more.. but anyways, I was apalled to find this out. I really wish this product would be ripped off of every shelf..."
4.00,"i liked the clean and not medicine like felling it left me with !"
5.00,"Great price and can never have too much of it. A quality product that is even better in a double pack."
5.00,"Really enjoy the pro-health products. The only toothpaste I use."
5.00,"I have major dental issues stemming from my rheumatoid arthritis. I am not over 50, but I decided to try this toothpaste anyway. This paste is a tad bit thicker which I really like. It stays on the toothbrush. It has a mild minty taste...not overpowering. Whether it is the best product on the market for over 55, I am not sure. Would I buy it again? Definitely...yes! My teeth feel clean and my breathe smells fresh."
5.00,"I love this toothpaste it makes me have such a nice clean feeling after using it. also make my breathe nice and minty."
5.00,"My teeth felt clean and my breath stayed fresh! I didn't have any sensitivity issues with my teeth after using the toothpaste!"

4.00,"I really liked this mouth wash. It left my mouth with a fresh clean feeling."

5.00,"I am happy with this item I just placed another order. Great value and fast easy delivery. Would recommend it to anyone with small children."

4.00,"Great mouth rinse! It left my mouth feeling great and is a great way to clean my night guard! It is a bit expensive"
5.00,"This is some of the best toothpaste on the market! I am partial to Crest, but this makes your mouth feel so clean! This taste is crisp and clean."

5.00,"I loved the mouthwash! I'm glad it didn't have a very strong flavor and it was pretty gentle overall. The mouthwash also made my mouth feel very fresh and clean and no doubt I'd buy it again."
4.00,"We have finally got to try the Pro-Health Rinse and it was worth the wait! I find my mouth feeling fresh and clean and that's saying alot when you have dentures. You can't really 'brush' your gums and nothing else I've tried worked to do more than just burn my mouth. We will be buying it again!"
5.00,"I liked this toothpaste. Some that I have tried recently have this weird after taste but Crest always seems to deliver a quality product that tastes fresh. It is one of 2 go to brands in toothpaste for me."
5.00,"i love it. it makes my teeth like the were just cleaned by the dentist"
3.00,"i hate the weird feeling of so called whitening effect ..it has weird feeling to it in my mouth, other than that, i love crest toothpaste"
5.00,"The crest line of dental products were great! They left my mouth feeling super clean! My teeth did indeed look whiter after using these products for a while!"
1.00,"This is the most ridiculous toothpaste I've every had the displeasure of putting in my mouth. I bought the product on a Monday evening and used the product twice daily for a total of 7 times. Adverse effects starting appearing immediately. My tongue felt like it had been scalded from the first use. It is Friday and I have had the \"just brushed\" taste distortion since the using the product 4 days ago. I haven't brushed in 14 hours and the taste distortion is still prevalent. At least a dozen canker sores have appeared on the sides of my tongue and corners of my mouth that I can attribute directly to the toothpaste. The worst part would have to be the swelling though of the lips, mouth and throat which appeared after the 2nd day. My research has shown 100s of similar cases. This has been a hassle and I hadn't even begun the critically acclaimed skin sloughing in the mouth, staining or gum issues. I am not noticeably allergenic or sensitive to dental products and this is the first instance I've ever experienced something like this. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone without sampling it first."
4.00,"I loved the clean feeling after brushing. Great taste."
5.00,"This is some of the best mouthwash ever!! It leaves my mouth feeling amazing for hours!! Will definitely recommend this to everyone I know."
5.00,"When choosing a toothpaste, taste is a feature that I take into consideration. This toothpaste is great. Crest's toothpaste is refreshing without being overpowering. My mouth felt clean without having the toothpaste residue remain in my mouth long after brushing."
5.00,"I will definitely recommend this toothpaste, amazing!! Feels like a straight from the dentist clean after every brushing:)"
5.00,"We love the Crest Pro Health tooth paste! Both my son and myself use it! Very happy with the product!"
4.00,"Leaves your mouth feeling fresh and clean. Has a bit of an after taste though."
5.00,"Me and my family love crest and their whole line of products. In particular this toothpaste has a great taste and leaves my teeth feeling clean and protected."
5.00,"Love this mouthwash because it helps keep bad breath from forming throughout the day. Great product!"

5.00,"I'd absolutely love this product. Made my mouth feel really fresh, just like coming out of a Dentist's office."

5.00,"The clinical products are wonderful. Leave your teeth feeling super clean without an over-powering minty flavor."
5.00,"I tried this product and I absolutely loved it, it leaves your mouth feeling really clean and fresh for a long period of time."

3.00,"i liked the way it made my mouth feel. i dont think it was special enough to make it the only brand of toothpaste that i buy."
3.00,"I like this brand but I think it could use a polishing agent. It makes my teeth feel dry."
1.00,"Don't buy this.  It stains your teeth brown.  Go look at all the reviews for the regular Crest Pro-Health rinse on this site.  I predict the Cool Wintergreen version does the same thing, because it has the same active ingredient."
1.00,"Please do an Internet search before using this product - After 3 months of using everyday, my teeth have become incredibly stained. It's unbelievable. I did an Internet search and have found thousands of people are having the same issue. there is an ingredient in this stuff that in many instances will dull your teeth and turn them brown. BEWARE, and please do your research."
5.00,"Seems no one locally carries this product anymore...sup rising after the ad am sign put forth and the quality of the product. Glad to find it here!"
5.00,"I love how clean my teeth feels each time I use it! Highly recommend to others!"
5.00,"coincided with a trip to dentist and i still have that fresh clean feel that i get at the dentist"
3.00,"Left my teeth and mouth feeling clean and fresh. Not sure that I would neccessarily replace my current brand for this one."

5.00,"i love the feeling of clean it the toothpast leaves in your mouth!!!!"
5.00,"It worked so good! Iloved the way it left my mouth feeling!"
5.00,"Kept my breath fresh all day long (8hrs) my mouth felt cleaner then it's ever felt with any other mouthwash! I got a sample and I have now made the switch, I am totally loyal to this mouthwash & so is my whole family! My daughter (9yrs old) even loves it!"
5.00,"Used to spend lots of money on products for my sensitive teeth, but never felt they cleaned my teeth well. Crest Pro-Health gives me the best of both worlds at a reasonable price."
5.00,"We like all the Crest Clinical line of both toothpaste and mouthwash. The flavor isn't too strong/overpowering, but the product is very effective."
4.00,"I liked this mouthwash. The flavor was good and it felt like it cleaned my teeth very well."
4.00,"I bought Crest Pro Health this week, it is really good. It makes your teeth feel really clean, Crest has always been a household name and again, they have come up with a great product! Thank you for again, a great toothpaste!!!"
5.00,"The crest pro health mouth wash was great. I usually use another kind of mouth wash and this one seemed to make my whole mouth have a tingly clean feeling."
4.00,"I tried the new Crest ProHealth toothpaste. The taste was very good, felt good on my teeth, and made my breath nice and clean. Will continur to use this product!"
1.00,"I had a dental cleaning and checkup yesterday and I asked the hygienist for a mouthwash recommendation and this was it. I bought it and used it before bed last night. I thought it was pleasant while using it so I was pleased at the time. Before falling asleep, I noticed a very bitter taste in my mouth. When I got up and had breakfast this morning, I couldn't taste anything at all! I wondered if it was the mouthwash so I looked up reviews and sure enough, it was indeed the mouthwash. I won't be using it again to find out if it gets worse or if I get the stains others have experienced."
5.00,"Loved it made my mouth feel fresh! It did not put a odd taste in my mouth after using it."
4.00,"Keeps your mouth feeling fresh without the typical burn of most mouthwashes."
5.00,"Love the taste and feel of this product. It is my new favorite to use with my WaterPik"
5.00,"Love it! Clean and refreshing! I found my breath to be fresh and crisp!"
5.00,"The New Pro-Health Clinical products from Crest® and Oral-B® worked great and I am glad I was able to try them out."
3.00,"I bought the pro-health clinical that was for sensitive teeth as well, and it does get my teeth clean and my mouth feeling minty, but it hardly foams at all. I like my toothpaste to be quite foamy, and this one barely foamed. That texture of watery toothpaste isn't my favorite feeling in my mouth when brushing. I probably wouldn't buy it again for that reason alone. Otherwise, it did get my mouth feeling clean."
1.00,"As someone who suffers from periodontal disease, I am a little familiar with products designed to help cut plaque and reduced the incidence of gingivitis. My dentist has his list of preferred toothpastes, and I have tried a number of them. This is not on his list and I can see why. The active ingredient is stannous fluoride. Many toothpastes have this as an active ingredient, so it comes up pretty standard there. In fact, the toothpaste I use regularly has both fluoride and an active antibacterial agent. Since gingivitis is caused by bacterial growth, what I use currently is more likely to be effective than this product. It doesn't mention there is grit in the paste as a whitening agent. When I first started to brush for the first time I thought I had put the wrong material on my brush. It felt like there was sand in the toothpaste. The grit acts as a whitening agent, but if you ask any dentist, they will tell you to stay far away from it because it scours the enamel on the teeth. And, enamel is not replaceable....once it is gone it is gone for good. The product has a strong mint taste that is not disagreeable. If you plan to use this, take it to your dentist first and see what they think. If you like it and the dentist says its okay for you, then give it a try. Both my periodontist and my regular dentists said they wouldn't recommend it to anyone due to the grit."
2.00,"Crest pro health toothpaste tells me it has ActivClean crystals, which translates into crunchy toothpaste, not the most pleasant way to start the morning. The gel toothpaste has a strong taste which I didn't find refreshing or pleasant. Reading the box, Crest is supposed to fight cavities, gingivitis, plaque, sensitivity, tartar and it whitens and freshens breath. The instructions say to only use Crest pro health for sensitivity for four weeks, after that I guess it stops helping? Then the box says \"products containing stannous fluoride may cause staining of the teeth.\" The box continues on to tell me that Crest is specially formulated to prevent staining but if it does go see my dentist. I did a search on Stannous fluoride, it does strengthen the enamel better than other fluorides. however... many Americans can't afford dental care for issues like cavities, let alone blithely run off to get stains removed from their teeth. I am not impressed."
5.00,"This is truly one of the best toothpastes I have ever used. It left my mouth unbelievably clean and healthy feeling. It has reduced the amount of plaque on my teeth and improved the health of my mouth in general. I am looking forward to my next dental exam."
3.00,"taste was different than what i am used to but product worked great and did job intended"
3.00,"I prefer tubes of toothpaste that stand on end like this one does. But after relatively few uses, the cap simply broke at the hinges without any provocation. I mean I wasn't stressing it in any way. I had been using Crest 3D White toothpaste so this is somewhat of a comparison. Taste: Crest Pro-Health has a noticeably pleasant taste. It struck me as slightly medicinal but not in any bad way. As the review title says, I found it to be a bit too gooey, almost slimy. I am concerned about the inclusion in this formula, of \"hydrated silica\" as while that abrasive substance removes stains, it may also be removing enamel - a potential disaster over time. The other aspect to discuss is the active ingredient, which is this is Stannous fluoride 0.454%. (The 3D white has Sodium fluoride 0.243%.) Stannous fluoride is thought by dental scientists to be more effective than Sodium fluoride, and you will note this toothpaste contains a larger percentage than others. What this means to me is that I can get the recommended fluoride from this toothpaste and use a mouthwash that does not contain any but has other desirable attributes. The inactive ingredients are not listed on the tube but do appear on the box. Inactive ingredients can be important if you have allergies. The 'inactive' listing on my box is: glycerin hydrated silica sodium hexametaphosphate propylene glycol PEG-6 water zinc lactate flavor trisodium phosphate sodium lauryl sulfate sodium gluconate carrageenan sodium saccharin xanthan gum polyethylene titanium dioxide blue 1 Crest Pro-Health is marketed as defending \"against dental conditions people over 50 experience\". I know a lot of the verbiage on the carton and tube and in the advertising is more or less hype but they all have to say something or other to sell the product. So - it has the right ingredients and tastes good. Bottom line is that despite my complaints about this toothpaste, I'm going to keep using it."
1.00,"I have been using the Crest Pro Health line for little over a year and didn't make the connection between bad, dark teeth staining on lower front teeth to Crest Pro-Health until this week. I had a my professional dental cleaning and check-up a week ago. My stains were horribly dark blackish color. After dental cleaning, teeth went 3 shades whiter and back to normal looking. A week later after my dental cleaning, my lower teeth stained so fast as if I didn't brush my teeth for a year. I knew something was wrong, until I read the fine print warning on Pro-Heath line and the negative reviews on Amazon. It is important for people to call Crest and let them know that this product is poorly formulated. A tooth paste should not have so many side-effects. It is not acceptable that a toothpaste stains teeth a week after your expensive dental cleaning! I can't believe the ADA endorsed this toothpaste."
5.00,"I like the flavor (not overpowering) and my teeth felt really clean. Will definitely buy this again."
5.00,"I know why this was recommended by my dentist for not drying out my gums. It works without the burn of traditional mouthwash!!!"
5.00,"Tastes great, doesn't burn and leaves mouth feeling fresh and clean!"
4.00,"I love this toothpaste. I have been using sesodyne but ut can be very expensive. This product has a component for sensitivity and has been great so far."
4.00,"I love how clean the Crest Pro-Health Clinical toothpaste makes my teeth feel. It leaves them feeling cleaner for longer."
5.00,"I can never go wrong with Crest!!!! I will NEVER use another product for my teeth again....my teeth have never felt so clean! Better than a dentist office cleaning!"
5.00,"With Crest being such a trusted and well known brand, I felt comforted knowing I was putting in extra effort in keeping my teeth plaque free, without having to go to the dentist. My teeth felt as smooth and clean as can be!"
5.00,"Crest is a brand that I have always used and trusted for oral care. I feel that making it a part of my daily oral care routine, it really does help me obtain better dental check ups."
5.00,"Have been using for a couple of days love it leaves my teeth super clean. I love they way it leaves my mouth after i brush my teeth will buy it from now on."
5.00,"Crest Pro Health left my teeth feeling great, so fresh and clean. I plan to continue using this toothpaste and no other."
5.00,"Chest makes for a cleaner feeling mouth. It is refreshing when you need it the most."
4.00,"I have used WalMart's equivalent for several years but when I bought it recently it tasted AWFUL - like kerosine! Had to switch to the name brand. So sorry WalMart changed the formula."
5.00,"I love how this makes makes my mouth feel! So clean and refreshing. I would recommend this to everyone. My daughter even liked to the taste and she's 8."
4.00,"My teeth felt fresh and I recommend this. Great Product!"
2.00,"I used this product for 3 weeks. After use it constantly got worse in tingling and burning of the mouth. By day 21 I had to spit it out within seconds of it touching my mouth because of throbbing and what felt like chemical burns. Some people report faster times till pain and discomfort (some within one use). I look inside to my cheek and found scar tissue (white bumps) in the exact spot of burning. I then went to sleep to find my cheek swollen up the next morning. Through out the next day my cheek fell in swelling and I am still recovering 2 days later (white spots getting smaller). Very tender in the area and will go to doctor to get advice within the next few days. DO NOT SHIP your bottle back to Crest. They will offer to pay shipping etc. DO NOT do this. If they ask for a sample you could give that. This is your evidence and CPC in percentage in this product could be negligence by Crest. Clinical Trials by this company have shown exactly this among a high percentage of users and calling them shows many \"operators\" have taken compliants like this daily. Remember this is NON-Alcoholic. If it burns...STOP USING THE PRODUCT!"
5.00,"My children like the stages toothpaste. The flavor is good and both of them like Jake and his band of pirates"
3.00,"The Crest mouthhwash did not leave my mouth feeling 'as good as a Dentist's office' as is the claim."
5.00,"Don't know why, but this is the only toothpaste my son likes. Partly the neverland theme? Probably. Taste or flavor? Maybe."
5.00,"I love the crisp cinnamon flavor! Very limited availability. Amazon was the only source that had this in stock. Even the P&G store was out of stock. I have used the Pro Health for years with good results. This is the first time I have tried the cinnamon. I hope it will continue to be available."
5.00,"I liked this product it made your teeth feel clean and fresh. I have sensitive teeth and the toothpaste I think is the best for sensitive teeth."
5.00,"I really like the Crest Pro Health Clinical toothpaste. It leaves my teeth feeling nice and clean and has a pleasant taste. Does not foam too much which important to me."
4.00,"Great toothpaste. The aftertaste is refreshing and left a clean feeling mouth for quite awhile after brushing."
5.00,"I really liked the toothpaste best of all of the products I had to review. After using it, my teeth just felt clean. I like it better than any other toothpaste I've used. It is expensive but I will use it again because it just felt worth it. I liked the flavor too."
4.00,"As far as minty deliciousness is concerned, this is probably the best toothpaste I've ever tried. It feels like I'm brushing with Dentine Ice. For the fan of a fresh mouth, I highly recommend! But as far as the \"clinical protection\" propaganda is concerned, I wouldn't hold my breath. It isn't even ADA accepted and the box is filled with safety words that prevent any actual health claims from being stated. For example, this toothpaste \"helps\" prevent this and \"aids\" against that. The most impressive thing, in my opinion, is the one thing they barely market: reduces painful sensitivity. A lot of sensitivity toothpastes aren't very minty and are kind of bland, but certainly not this one. It contains 0.454% fluoride. Overall: the \"clinically proven\" stuff is just marketing, so don't think this toothpaste is really going to make your mouth any more healthy than a regular tube of Crest. However, I will say that this is one of the mintiest, most fresh-tasting toothpastes I've ever tried and so that is surely worth something. I wish it was ADA accepted and gave me more confidence as to its health benefits, but am still quite satisfied."
4.00,"I loved the flavor of this toothpaste and the big test is when you can put your tongue over the front of the teeth and it's completely smooth which means \"CLEAN\""
5.00,"I love this mouthwash! It's not like others it has a foaming action to make your mouth feel fresher."
4.00,"I would recommend this toothpaste to a friend and I have. It doesnt have any bad after taste like some other brands. And it really makes my mouth feel fresh and clean for along time after brushing."
5.00,"My teeth felt smooth & clean after each use. My husband even noticed a difference!!"
5.00,"My mouth is so clean and fresh and without the burn, I like it very much"
4.00,"I didn't want my children (young teens) using a mouthwash with alcohol in it. This really cleans their breath without the bite that others have."
5.00,"I absolutely love Crest & all of their products. This one did not disappoint!"
5.00,"I thought is had a great taste and made my teeth feel fresh and clean."
4.00,"This Pro-Health kit consists of: 1 43.7 yard Oral-B Glide Mint Floss 1 Medium Bristle Oral-B Tootbrush 1 6 ounce Cool Peppermint Flouride Toothpaste 1 Liter (33.8 fluid ounces) of Crest Oral Rinse (mouthwash) in cool mint The glide floss was thin and slippery enough to fit between some of my tightly spaced teeth although the floss was not covered in wax. The cool mint flavor is a nice touch as well. Since I prefer a waxed floss, I give this 4 stars. The tootbrush was too hard and too big for my taste. I prefer soft bristles. However, since the bristles cover a large surface area I did feel my teeth got a good cleaning. The toothbrush also has different types of bristles on the head in addition to a tongue and cheek cleaner. I rate the toothbrush 3 stars. I absolutely loved the toothpaste. The flavor is a cool peppermint without being overbearing. In fact, it was so fresh tasting I almost wanted to eat it (of course I would not do such a thing). I also like that the cap is the size of a 50 cent piece that enabled me to stand the tube face down on my counter. According to the packaging, there are 7 benefits to this toothpaste which I cannot verify. They claim it fights cavities, bad breath, whitens teeth, reduces tartar, fights gingivitis and plaque, and can be used on sensitive teeth. This is 5 stars. The mouthwash comes in a cool mint flavor and since it is alcohol free I did not experience the rawness I get from an alcohol-based oral rinse. I loved this also and rate it 5 stars. In summary, I loved everything but the toothbrush and was only mildly disappointed in the floss. Using this complete kit left my mouth feeling clean and my breath with a minty freshness. I personally would buy the items I like in the kit separately. Unless the kit is priced cheaper than the sum of its parts (no price was available on Amazon as of this writing), I see no reason to buy this as one unit except for ease of ordering."
5.00,"This is the best toothpaste! My mouth feels so clean and fresh after brushing! This product will remain in my house...love it!"
5.00,"This mouthwash doesn't burn when you use it, and freshens breath. I believe it will take longer term usage to see if it really helps whiten teeth and strengthen gum tissue. It's a relatively good value for the money, and will be even more so if it actually helps fight gum disease."
4.00,"I bought this and was skeptical as to if it would work. I went home and tried it and it made my mouth and teeth feel fresher and cleaner for a longer time."
4.00,"I added the Crest Pro Health Clinical mouth wash to my daily routine; both in the morning and evening after brushing. Overall, I really enjoyed the product. My breath felt fresher throughout the day, and my mouth felt healthier at night, as well as when i woke up in the morning. I was surprised by how much better i felt, as opposed to just brushing alone!"
5.00,"My teeth continued to feel as if I had just had them cleaned at the dentists office. What a great feeling day after day."
4.00,"Crest Pro Health are great products. Teeth feel really clean after brushing and I love the glide. I have a hard time with other flosses and this one does extactly what the names says. It glides so easy between your teeth."
5.00,"It worked so great! I'm ready to purchase this \"Heaven in my mouth\" for the next year! I don't EVER want to run out!"
5.00,"My family and I love Crest products, especially the toothpaste!! It really gets your teeth clean, while helping your mouth to feel refreshed, and fresh not just while you are brushing, but for many hours after! It also has a nice taste, which is an added bonus!"
4.00,"My dentist says that its not the toothpaste but the act of brushing that cleans teeth. But the ingredients can have a beneficial effect. This toothpaste tries to cover everything that can go wrong. Good for Crest. I think their directions to brush for 1 minute is to get you to leave the toothpaste in contact with your teeth to have time to do its chemical whitening. I have had good results from their 3D Whitening Rinse and its 1 minute of contact time. I prefer to whiten with a toothpaste over the peroxide strips. Tartar and plaque are tough to counteract so at least this toothpaste provides some help. I floss and brush my gums so that helps toughen them and I've had no decay problems at the gum line."
4.00,"The taste is good what it offers is great, I am extremely happy that it does what it says it does."
4.00,"feel refreshed after brushing.doesn't foam very easily"
4.00,"I prefer mouthwashes/rinses without alcohol or added color. It works well enough but I can't say I noticed any difference using it after my recent dental cleaning compared to other rinses."
1.00,"I started using this product a few weeks ago, not only did it leave my mouth feeling numb and food tasteless, it stained my teeth and gums. I have no idea how this product has made it on our shelves but it just goes to show the lack of quality control on things being sold to the public these days. Stay away from this mouthwash!!"
4.00,"This left my teeth feeling clean, but it doesn't whiten as well as other toothpastes made specifically for whitening."
5.00,"Both my husband and I really like this mouthwash, it works well."
5.00,"The Crest pro health toothpaste does an amazing job. My husband and I like the results very much!"
5.00,"crest has great features that will be making your teeth feel good and looking good at the same time. it is a great toothpaste to help your gums be healthy and your teeth clean. I like the taste of it also."
4.00,"Felt great on my teeth. Very clean! Only reason I wouldn't rate with all stars is the taste. Although I am one that always hates the taste of toothpaste."
5.00,"This is a great value for the price! It makes my mouth feel super clean and does a great job at freshening my breath!"
1.00,"The next couple of days after using this toothpaste only once, made the inside of my mouth peel, sore, and dry. I thought this product was suppose to be good for your gums and health."
5.00,"I loved this product...I normally can't stand a mouth wash because it feels so harsh and leaves a bad after taste, but not so with the Crest. My mouth felt clean and fresh for hours after using and I bought some for the whole family."
5.00,"really like this toothpaste. the price was a bit higher than i really like to pay for toothpaste though so that was a bit of a negative. great taste and great benifits!"
5.00,"My mouth definitely felt clean, fresh and invigorated after using this mouthwash. In fact we have already purchased it for our family. Thanks for allowing me to try it out!"
5.00,"This toothpaste made my mouth feel so clean! It helps to remove the plaque very well. Love it!"
4.00,"This product kept my breath fresh and clean feeling. I liked it."
5.00,"i love this toothpaste. it leaves these little chrystal particles on my teeth which seem to be doing their job even after i rinse my mouth. my mouth feels really clean and refreshed. my whole family loves this toothpaste."
1.00,"First the container for the toothpaste is packaged poorly. The cap is overly large and it is hard to squeeze out the last of the paste. Excessive use of plastic, keep it simple. The paste itself does no more or no less than regular crest. Extremely disappointed."
3.00,"This toothpaste seems to work to get your teeth clean and mouth feeling refreshed... but it does have a bit of an off flavor that I'm not excited about. That said, I usually have a fair amount of what I like to call \"slime\" on my teeth, especially after eating or drinking sugar laced foods - this toothpaste removes that gunk well. Overall, you might want to try a tube of this before stocking up to make sure it's right for you. For me, I prefer the flavor and mouth feeling of Tom's of Maine more than this Crest stuff."
5.00,"I loved new Crest with plaque control was extremely effective. My teeth feel cleaner."
4.00,"I really liked the Crest Pro Health toothpaste. My mouth and gums felt so much cleaner and felt like they had a thorough cleaning. The Pro Health does have a slightly gritty feel, but I got used to that pretty quick. I like how my mouth felt after too, clean for a while."
5.00,"I love Crest products and I realy love this toothpaste. My teeth were so happy with their super clean and smooth feel. Thank you, Crest, for another great product!"
4.00,"My teeth feel clean after use. My gum is no longer bleeding after first use."
4.00,"Great flavor, left my mouth feeling clean and fresh!"
3.00,"The toothpaste was okay, not very different from other toothpastes. The taste was a bit unpleasant. But overall, it does the job it is intended to do."
4.00,"I loved the mouthwash...made my mouth feel fresh and clean!"
1.00,"I used this product for 3 days. I started experiencing a metallic taste in my mouth but thought it was a reaction to medication. Gradually I have been noticing food tasting differently. Today, the third day I no longer can taste salt and most of other taste sensations are significantly diminished. I have read other reviews here and elsewhere that this product can cause that. Please spread the word so this does not happen to others."
5.00,"I was quite surprised to try the new Crest toothpaste, Pro-Health Plaque control. I tried it for a week start to get a really good feel for it. I'm quite amazed on how clean my mouth stayed through out the day. As a smoker normally I brush and within hours my mouth feels dirty again, but with this it stayed feeling clean and fresh. The price is some what high for the product but all in all it's worth it."
4.00,"Crest Pro Health Was New & Exciting For Me..... My Mouth Felt So Clean & It Made Me Feel Confident When Close To Other People."
5.00,"There is no hype in the advertisement ! Your teeth are cleaner and you can feel the clean when you run your tongue over your teeth. Everyone should try the toothpaste. You will not be sorry."
5.00,"I was surprised to read the two (one was a duplicate) unfavorable reviews... we love this toothpaste. It has everything - cleaning, whitening, and sensitivity. We only use a small amount - most people use too much toothpaste, and it does have a strong flavor if you load your brush. As for the person who had sores in her mouth, that cannot possibly have anything to do with the toothpaste. If you use the recommended amount, the taste is fine - and I'm sensitive to strong flavors. I like the wide cap, so you can sit the tube on a cabinet shelf, upside down. It takes up a lot less space in your medicine cabinet that way."
5.00,"Before trying Crest Pro-Health toothpaste, I was a big fan of another big name toothpaste. The clean feeling after using Crest was the same, but the after taste was so much better with Crest! My breath felt like it stayed more fresh for quite a while after brushing. I will not be going back to my old brand. :)"
4.00,"I liked the feel of my teeth after using this product, and for hours afterward. The flavor is strong, but it helped keep my breath fresh too."
4.00,"I was very pleased at how clean it made your mouth, you felt it killing germs."
5.00,"Not sure why this product was discontinued but I'm glad I was able to purchase this from this seller which made the experience awesome, communication, delivery time and condition of the product excellent. There is none to be found in any store, I guess in time there will not be anymore to buy so I will make it last until next time I go crazy looking for more."
5.00,"My mouth feels so clean and refreshed! Love it! I truly do recommend this product!"
4.00,"made my mouth feel fresh and clean. did not feel like i had to hide my breath even as the day went on. keeps my teeth protected but my breath smelling fresh even after having garlic for lunch."
4.00,"Crest Pro-Health mouthwash is something I wanted to try mainly because it is alcohol-free. Other mouth rinses that actually make my mouth feel clean and not just                                              \"minty\" usually have a strong flavor almost to the point of burning.                                              Crest Pro-Health  rinse has a light minty flavor, and it makes my mouth feel very clean.                                              I would definitely buy this again, and it just may be replacing my current brand."
5.00,"I love this product. I couldn't wait to get this at the store."
4.00,"When i received this sample I was pleased. I showed it to my daughter and we both sampled it together , so we could get two opinions. I really enjoy its flavor and smell, I rinse my mouth and left a fresh clean scent. She thought it was a little strong for her . I have since bought this for me and my husband and we use it daily."
5.00,"I purchased the Crest Pro-Health Clinical Gum Protection toothpaste for my husband, as he has gingivitus so we are hoping this helps, along with diligent flosing!"
5.00,"This mouthwash was no different than the other Crest mouthwashes I have tried and I love all of them!! It left my breath smelling fresh for a long period of time and I love when a mouthwash feels like it is killing the germs and all the bad things that get into your mouth. I love the Pro-Health line and this mouthwash is no different!"
4.00,"I've been looking for a decent toothpaste without flouride, but that effort has been like looking for a needle in a haystack. This product, even with flouride, I like. I like the cap design. Very easy to open / close and it can't get lost. I like the material used in the tube. It's flexible enough to use -- not overly thick, and doesn't feel \"tinny\" like regular tubes. I like the flavor / taste / texture. It's not an \"IN YOUR FACE\" flavor, but it's not a lame, flat tasting performer, either. After brushing my mouth feels very clean and tingly, but not overly so. What I don't like -- It has flouride."
5.00,"This toothpaste left my mouth feeling clean and fresh. I would recommend it to anyone."
4.00,"Crest Pro Health left my teeth and mouth feeling clean, bright and fresh for any hours."
3.00,"I was a little leery trying Crest Pro-Health Whitening Fresh Clean Mint Toothpaste because I did not like a similar Crest product at all. This \"whitening\" version isn't as bad though. I find it to be a good toothpaste, but nothing better than average. The minty taste is OK. Nothing else about it stands out other than it is gritty like most Crest Pro-Health Toothpastes. I have not seen any whitening benefits after using for a couple of weeks. Crest Pro-Health Whitening Fresh Clean Mint Toothpaste to me is just a middle of the road toothpaste. There are many I like better, but I've used worse."
4.00,"Crest Pro Health will definitely leave your mouth feeling clean after using it. I love the fact that you can actually feel it working as you brush your teeth, and immediately after you're finished. The only thing that I don't care much for is the mint flavor (which of course most toothpastes have), but I will deal with it because I know that I'm keeping my teeth healthy and extra clean. Great product, and the flavor is really not a problem at all, just my own personal preferences."
3.00,"I had been using the product for a few weeks, after noticing that my gums did look red and swollen. They started to get better, much more pink and pretty and I thought \"hey this works\" Yay. Then I noticed in the back corner of my mouth was what looked almost like a white puss pocket where the gum tissue had come off and my mouth hurt like hell. I stopped this toothpaste right away and began rinsing my mouth with warm salt water every night and it went away. I went to the dentist a week later and low and behold I need a root canal. :( The suprising thing was that the problem tooth is on the opposite end of my mouth. That sore back corner of my mouth is fine which makes me wonder what in the h*ll that \"protection\" toothpaste did to my mouth. I also didn't like the taste or texture. It feels way too gritty. I did notice however that it said not to use that toothpaste for more than a few weeks. Perhaps I just used it too long and that's when the \"side effect\" came in. I will at least give it some benefit of the doubt (hence three stars instead of one). Always read directions before using a product rather than after, which is what I did in this case."
5.00,"This mouthwash was excellent, making my mouth feel clean without the almost-burning sensation that some of the stronger mouthwashes leave. It left a nice taste that lasted for a while, as well. I don't feel like it was all that different from other Crest mouthwashes I've used, though, other than the specific benefits touted on the bottle, and the taste was a bit different. That's a good thing to me - they're a consistent brand - but if you're looking for something really new and different then this isn't it, in my opinion."
1.00,"I bought this product after my dentist said the pockets in my gums were getting too deep. I was trying to prevent having to have an SRP. After using it for a day or two I noticed my mouth was numb and feeling raw but I figured it was because I had started taking better care of my gums and the flossing was causing it. Then I lost my sense of taste. Then my entire left side of my face began to hurt. Then, I wake up this morning and my teeth are brown at the base, halfway up the tooth and between the teeth. My teeth are generally very white so this is a stark difference in my smile. I searched the internet to figure out what it could be and this pops up as a big complaint about this product. It is the ONLY thing I was doing different except for flossing more often. And then I looked for a warning label and sure enough, in tiny letters at the bottom of the bottle above the UPC code it says that it could stain teeth. My dentist says I will need to get another cleaning done and even then sometimes it won't come off. Now I have to pay out of pocket for another cleaning since I just had one. She also said to get a sonicare and that may help a little. Bottom line, if I could give this product ZERO STARS I would. Crest has been a company I have trusted for years and I expected more from them. The warning should be larger and more prominant. It is written below the money back guarentee. Sadly, I doubt I can get them to pay for my sonicare and cleaning. If I had kept my reciept I could get my money back, but who keeps mouthwash receipts?"
4.00,"I like this product because it leaves your mouth feeling fresh and clean."
4.00,"Refreshing taste was long lasting. My mouth felt clean and fresh. I liked this product very much."
4.00,"I have always been a Crest girl, but I love the new clinical protection line! My teeth feel extremely clean after brushing and I am confident that I will have an excellent result at the dentist at my next check up!"
5.00,"Pro-Health toothpastes are the only ones I use. I have sensitive teeth and they work great!"
3.00,"I've been using this toothpaste for over a year, as it was recommended by my dentist after a bout of gingivitis. My boyfriend and I both switched at the same time, and the first night he was wondering what the long stringy white junk he was pulling out of his mouth was. I don't have this peeling all of the time, but every couple of days, it happens, where you have to pull it out of your mouth. It's quite disgusting. I decided to look this up on the internet today and the first thing I seen when I typed in \"Crest Pro Heath Gum Protection\" was \"Side effects\"... which I found odd. Sure enough, there are hundreds of other people having the same things happen. To those who are all upset because they think us who are \"complaining\" are just \"competitors\" well, we are not, we are simply expressing an issue that's occurring. I like this toothpaste, as it's ridden my gingivitis, but I do get gum peeling which flat out sucks. Lately I've started brushing twice a day and am noticing my mouth feels burnt and raw. Last night I decided to skip my before bed brush because my mouth is feeling this way, and I said that I needed a break. Thinking about this further, it's quite ridiculous to think you need a break from brushing your teeth. This should not be happening. I will likely keep using this toothpaste, until it possibly becomes painful, but I will be discussing this with my dentist and seeing what they have to say."
1.00,"This thing is terrible. I followed the instruction of not drinking or eating for 30 minutes after using it. However, it leaves me with a bad taste for the whole day. It tastes like nail polish to me. I tried drinking lots of water, eating soup, etc. Nothing works. I hope it will go away tomorrow. I really should have checked Amazon review on this product before buying it on impulse at Walmart."
4.00,"I love crest products! I have used their toothpastes all my life and am excited that they keep working to improve their products."
5.00,"I have been using another brand for quite a while, but crest has definitely won me over. Keeps my breath fresh and it keeps it feeling clean."
5.00,"It left my mouth feeling clean longer! I can't say the same for other products I have used before. It is on the pricey side but it works"
5.00,"It last all day you feel like you just brushed your teeth great taste too"
4.00,"Would recommend!"
1.00,"I bought this toothpaste and have been using it twice a day for a little over 4 weeks. I should have stopped long ago. It has made all of my gums so sore, and my tounge feels like I have been chewing sunflower seeds all day! My gums strated hurting so bad I didn't even WANT to brush my teeth, it became a hassle! I would never use this product again, and would NEVER reccomend it. Switched toothpastes yesterday and mouth already feels so much better."
5.00,"I bought it because it had sensitivity in it to, besides the tarter protection."
4.00,"I have been using this product for about 2 years and my dental checkups have improved quite a bit. It works for me."
5.00,"I love the way it makes you mouth feel clean. I have told almost everyone I talk to about it. I would recommend and buy this product."
5.00,"The toothpaste really makes my mouth feel great! It cleans deeply, and tastes really nice too."
5.00,"Crest is a great product. Leaves your teeth feeling clean and your mouth feeling refreshed."
5.00,"This mouthwash works wonders. I liked the taste and my mouth felt so fresh afterwards. Keep up the great work, Crest. I will be buying it again."
5.00,"I bought the Crest Pro-Health Sensitivity toothpaste and love it! Will definitely buy it again."
4.00,"This product works great. Breath smells fresh hours after use. Would definitely recommend."
5.00,"Tried it and will use it again. Pleasant taste and it makes my mouth and teeth feel clean"
4.00,"I really do love this product, but there wasn't enough of a difference from other mouthwashes for me to justify purchasing this product again."
5.00,"Love this toothpaste! Not too strong tasting and leaves teeth feeling super clean."
4.00,"This product was a pleasant surprise. Recently I tried another brand that claims to keep your teeth clean in between visits to the dentist and the taste was horrible. But Crest Clinical has a very pleasant taste that left my mouth feeling super clean!"
1.00,"You need to change the cap on this toothpaste. It won't close easily and the blue paste \"drizzles\" down the sink or on the counter. I've already thrown out the majority of the tube. Yeech!!"
4.00,"I thought this toothpaste cleaned very well. My teeth and mouth felt very clean. I am not a big fan of the flavor of the toothpaste."
5.00,"Crest Pro-Health Multiprotection Rinse has a good flavor and works well. It leaves my mouth feeling clean and fresh without any burning, stinging, or alcoholic flavor. I've tried many mouthwashes, and this is nothing like the standard brands that have been around for a while. The Crest Rinse seems like it's helping to keep my gums healthy and leaves my teeth feeling clean and smooth. These bottles are really large, which is great because it lasts quite a while. My whole family uses this product and we recommend it."
4.00,"It had a minty taste that lasted. I enjoyed using it!"
5.00,"I love the pro-health series of crest products, they leave my teeth feelinf squeaky clean, the series leaves a nice minty after taste and your teeth really feel clean longer."
4.00,"Works great, teeth felt clean, taste isn't the most appealing but it is very effective."
5.00,"I really liked the toothpaste, it left my mouth feeling fresh."
5.00,"The Crest Pro-Health toothpaste left my teeth feeling very smooth and clean. Throughout the day, I didn't get that yucky feeling on my teeth that normally evolves after eating, etc. I was very happy with this product!"
5.00,"This toothpaste has a great taste, it does give you that just left the dentist feeling when you're done brushing and even though one of the things it does for you is whiten your teeth, it's non-abrasive. I think this is a great product for someone like me who struggles with bad breath."
4.00,"Crest is a great toothpaste, I switched to it when I realize that Colgate is not made in the USA. I am very pleased with Crest toothpaste, it gets my teeth very clean."
5.00,"This toothpaste helps keep my teeth clean and whitens them too."
3.00,"Effective, but leaves a horrible taste in my mouth."
4.00,"I have had problems with bleeding gums even though I floss. I feel my gums are healthier since using this toothpaste."
5.00,"This toothpaste is the best! It makes my mouth feel so clean. I ran out of Pro Health & used another brand that was hidden in vanity. Big mistake! Rushed to the store to stock up on Pro Health."
5.00,"I was totally enthralled with it, love that it really helps with plaque! So happy thank you for a great incentive;)"
5.00,"Thank you Vocal point!!!!"
4.00,"My teenage so gives me a royally hard time about his quality of brushing. He needs to brush better and it's a struggle. This toothpaste actually made his mediocre brushing work better against the plaque buildup. I'm still working on his brushing , but this was truly an extra layer of help thrown in! What a great toothpaste!"
1.00,"I am angry but also as happy as a camper right now as I write this review. I have been using this product off and on for about 6 months or so. Only recently I have noticed that it looks like I have tooth decay between my top teeth and along the bottoms/side of my bottom teeth. I don't have any pain, so I did some google searches and figured out that there is nothing wrong with my teeth! I found a picture online of someone's teeth that look identical to mine, and low and behold--it was due to Crest Pro-Health rinse! Wooohooo. I swear I thought all of my teeth were decaying, but I figured that couldn't be the case since 1.) I have no pain/sensitivity to hot or cold food, and 2.) I have never had a cavity before. So although I am extremely angry that this crappy product caused cosmetic ugly stains to my teeth, I am so excited after reading all of the Amazon reviews that these stains are not cavities and can be removed by a deep cleaning from my dentist. I was so afraid to go to the dentist because of these dark marks in between my teeth. I figured he would tell me I needed crowns on all of my teeth."
5.00,"I love this product as it leaves my mouth feeling fresh and clean!"
5.00,"I am a regular user of the crest pro health line. This plaque control toothpaste definitely falls in line with the other great products offered in this line! It's an amazing clean with a great taste. I would recommend to anyone looking for a fantastic toothpaste!"
4.00,"I have for the most part always used crest toothpaste. I like how they try to keep improving it. I like how fresh and clean it makes your mouth feel. Preventing cavities is very important as well as keeping your mouth fresh and clean and this product does just that."
4.00,"mouth feels clean afterwards. would love if it was a bit cheaper =)"
5.00,"This toothpaste is easy on the teeth but left them smooth!"
4.00,"Good flavor, and left teeth feeling clean and smooth."
5.00,"Love this product, will continue to use it. Makes my teeth feel super clean."
5.00,"my mouth felt very clean. something I will recommend to a friend"
5.00,"Not only did my teeth look and feel very clean but I felt a bit refreshed!"
5.00,"Our family has been using this product for several years and we have found that the ProHealth line of Crest Toothpaste provides the overall best clean in the shortest time possible."
5.00,"crest pro health toothpaste is my favorite toothpaste. It cleaned and whitened my teeth very well, crest is the only brand i buy and only brand i will continue to buy. I would recommend this to anyone."
5.00,"Crest brand is my favorite toothpaste but the Pro Crest is really the best and does everything you want in a toothpaste and even tastes great!"
3.00,"Okay product. Cleans really well and seems to do a good job whitening. The only drawback is that after brushing it leaves a yucky film residue in your mouth that has to be rinsed and/or brushed out."
4.00,"I love all the products..a great fan of oral-b tooth brush. I would rather the floss not to be in just a string form...i rather the the floss/picks."
3.00,"Crest's toothpaste left my mouth feeling filmy unlike my usual toothpaste."
5.00,"Always have been Colgate fans but tried this and we really liked it!"
4.00,"My mouth feels very refreshed after using the rinse. Price is a little high."
5.00,"I have unhealthy gums, and normal mouthwash just doesn't do that good of a job. This mouthwash is a little more uncomfortable than other mouthwash, but so is going to the dentist. This stuff makes my swollen gums look healthy after one use. And it's the only mouthwash that keeps my mouth that keeps my mouth from feeling icky in the morning after using it at night. After mouth washing and spitting it out, you see the bubbles lining your gums from this stuff killing bacteria, just like you see peroxide bubbles on a wound from the peroxide killing the baddies."
4.00,"Crest products are the ones I use most & will continue to do so. They do the best job."
5.00,"Crest ProHealth toothpaste was great!! It left my mouth feeling fresh and clean."
4.00,"I appreciated this product and it worked well, but I prefer my old toothpaste better and won't be switching products."
4.00,"Gotta love the opportunity to try new things especially when those new things are good!"
5.00,"we have been using this tooth past for te last 6 years and we don't need to go to the dentist all I can say it GOOD"
5.00,"Tastes as good as it works. It has a strong, but good, mint flavor to it and it felt like I had brushed my teeth with mouth wash. My teeth felt and looked sparkling clean when I got done and when I licked my tongue across them they felt clean, kind of like that feeling you get when the dentist just got done cleaning them. Really is a great breath fresher as well. It looks a bit odd when you put it on your toothbrush. Sort of a pale color that looks somewhat foamy but it really gets in between all your teeth very well so it can do a great job of cleaning them."
5.00,"The taste was great. I would buy this. It was fresh and delicious."
5.00,"After purchasing the product, I forgot about it as I finished up the tube I had been using. When it ran out I grabbed my new tube of Crest and gave it a try. The fresh clean feeling of my mouth was wonderful! Now I see why they call it PRO-HEALTH! I have found my new favorite product and will continue to enjoy that fresh clean feeling!"
4.00,"I have terrible gums, no matter how often I brush/floss/mouthwash. I've tried almost all kinds of mouthwash, this one included, but found Act to be best for my mouth. I decided to give this another try and while it's great, I don't feel like it works as well as Act. However, it is way out of Listerine's league. Their mouthwash is disgusting and does nothing for me."
5.00,"I have been purchasing products that promise to whiten when actually I needed one to remove plaque! Plaque is what causes cavities & keeps your teeth from being white! I am so happy to find this great product!!"
5.00,"This product from Crest tastes and feels like a typical mouthwash product. It apparently has additional ingredients to improve the functionality of the product. It seems to work quite well though."
5.00,"I've actually find myself looking forward to using it, because I just love the minty-clean feeling afterwards I never got with just brushing alone! Definitely a product I would recommend to anyone; especially those who, like myself, have been dissatisfied with other mouthwashes in the past!"
5.00,"I have been using this toothpaste and wondered if Amazon would have it cheaper than buying it locally. Luckily, it was so I ordered it. It leaves my teeth clean without any residue."
4.00,"i tried the floss. it was a nice change to use one that didn't fray when i used it. it glides easily and makes it easier to floss"
5.00,"This was my first time trying the Crest Pro-Health toothpaste. Immediately, I loved the texture, I haven't used a toothpaste like this before. The toothpaste has great flavor too, very minty. It left my mouth feeling fresh for a long time after. Definitely liked this toothpaste."
4.00,"I've used one of the products in this package, but the others I'm fairly unaware of. Here's a rundown of each product: Toothpaste: I've actually used this before and have purchased it in the past. It tastes decent enough and does a good job of cleaning my teeth and keeping me from having stank breath as bad when I wake up. That I've bought it before and would willingly buy it again probably says a lot here. 5/5 Floss: This is pretty much your standard floss. It has a nice minty taste and I can taste hints of it after I've flossed, although I've seen flosses that taste better (can't think of them offhand since I've used so many). The best thing about this is that like the name, this glides through your teeth with no issues. It was really soft, which I liked. 5/5 Toothbrush: This seems to be the swiss army knife of toothbrushes. For a handheld and non-electronic toothbrush, this does quite a bit and can be used on pretty much every inch of your mouth. I prefer my water pik, but this is something nice that I'd pick up for a trip or to keep at someone else's house. The bristles were nice and soft, but almost too soft for a medium in my opinion. If you want a really stiff brush you'll probably want to go with the most stiff setting. I liked this, so I'd get the medium bristle if left to my own devices. 4/5 Mouthwash: I really wanted to like this, but I can't really see where this is any different from what I buy store-brand wise. It tastes good and promises a lot, but I don't see a huge amount of difference from the other stuff. If you're into name brands rather than store brands (I know people who prefer this) then this would be one I'd recommend. However just like the tinted store brands, this can stain something if you let it soak long enough, so if you're soaking night guards or similar items then prepare for it to come out blue. This wasn't overly strong but if you have very, very sensitive taste buds then you'll want to add a little water, though. I just didn't feel strongly enough about this to really recommend it over the store brands. 3/5 Overall this is a decent little package and I'd say that as a whole I'd give the kit and kaboodle four stars. The mouthwash was the only thing that was sort of middle of the road, but that's because I can't find anything to show that it's so overwhelmingly amazing that I'd recommend it over store brand. The other stuff? Sure, I'd recommend those name-brand wise."
5.00,"Amazing product, when I used it I loved the cleaning it did to my teeth! I did not get the bad taste you get after you brush your teeth, and drink oj;) great product!"
4.00,"Crest has always been a family favorite. So when we had the oppurtunity to try the new Crest Pro- Health we did. It definately does the job- and my mouth feels clean after using this toothpaste. It has a slightly gritty texture that turned my kiddo off. This is cleaning beads that do an excellent job. Overall, a good product, definately has a \"Clinical\" taste to it."
4.00,"Crest is a brand that I've grown to love and trust over the years. It definately gives me that clean / fresh feeling. I will purchase this product again :)"
5.00,"I have sensitive teeth and decided to try this product. It worked amazing on my teeth and made them feel smooth and clean. Love this product and will continue to use."
1.00,"I used this for a while and noticed the mouth slime problem others were having, but didn't attribute it to the toothpaste and just put up with it. Recently, I took a good look at the inside of my mouth and my teeth were all getting stained, despite my brushing two times a day, flossing, and using mouthwash. I then realized I had been using stannous fluoride toothpaste instead of regular sodium fluoride. Do not buy this; stick with sodium fluoride."
5.00,"I loved the way my teeth felt after I brushed and I also liked that it was super \"minty\". All around a great product and I will definitely try it again."
5.00,"I loved it - it made me feel squeaky clean all day! :D"
5.00,"I really like this product. Going to a dentist is so expensive so I want a toothpaste that keeps my teeth healthy. This toothpaste fits my needs."
5.00,"Wow! I love this toothpaste, my teeth looked and felt so clean after using it. Nice clean flavor too. I will continue to buy this product, worth every penny."
3.00,"I don't care for the taste of this and it doesn't do any better job than other toothpastes."
5.00,"I bought this toothpaste a while back and just recently started using it. I noticed a difference right away in how clean my teeth feel and how fresh my whole mouth feels when I'm doing brushing my teeth. It's a little more expensive than other toothpastes but I definitely think it's worth it."
1.00,"I bought this toothpaste looking for something new. Little did I know it was gonna eat up the inside of my lips and checks. I can't taste my food any more:( it's also eating up my gums. I used two tubes, I kept ruling the toothpaste out as my husband hasn't had a problem. After reading the reviews I realized I don't have thrush! I just need to stop using crest pro health!! I'll go back to my toms tooth paste!!"
5.00,"This is a great product. I really like the \"mintiness\" (if that's even a word), and how refreshed my mouth feels after using the rinse. It doesn't leave a bad aftertaste either which is also highly to my liking. Overall, I'd say this product is excellent."
1.00,"I've been using the Crest Pro-Health Mouth Rinse for a couple months, and have recently noticed browning of in between and top of my teeth. I couldn't believe what I saw. I stopped using the product a few days ago. Can anyone tell me how to get rid of the stain?"
5.00,"I like the mint taste of this toothpaste. I recently had my dental cleaning and have been able to maintain that professional clean dental feel. Great!"
4.00,"I love this product. I was staying at my mom's house over the weekend and used some of hers. It was so great that I switched my own at home! I love the clean feeling. I'm not really a fan of mouthwash or anything like that, but this product is different. Fantastic! I love it all!"
5.00,"This toothpastes has made my mouth full of braces feel clean the first time I brush. Don't have to brush again and again."
5.00,"I used Crest Enamel Shield for a couple of years with great results. A while back i switched to Arm & Hammer Advanced White after reading the good reviews and noticed over a period of time that my teeth were becoming less white and more sensitive. I switched back to the Crest and my teeth are becoming noticeably whiter again and my teeth and gums feel much better. The taste is decent compared to some others and in my opinion is better than the Arm & hammer. I love this toothpaste and so does my dentist."
4.00,"I love the Crest Prohealth products! So far I have only tried the Clinical mouthwash. It makes your mouth feel clean, but I prefer the taste of the other prohealth rinses."
4.00,"It kept your mouth clean & had a good taste to it."
1.00,"I just purchased the Crest Pro Health last night August 15, 2012 and used it after brushing, exactly according to directions, and today I cannot taste anything! My tongue feels as if it has been scalded.  I plan to contact the company for a refund.  I've learned a hard lesson, I will do my research on a product before wasting my money and jeopardizing my body or health.  I only hope my sense of taste returns!"
5.00,"Love this toothpaste... I have been using it for a few weeks now and it makes my mouth feel super clean. Even my husband (who is a die hard fan of another brand) wanted to try it because it smelled \" really minty\"."
4.00,"I've used Pro-Health products for a few years now, mostly the toothpaste for me, while my husband uses the toothpaste and the toothbrushes. We've been pleased with this set, though found more uses for some items than others. The toothbrush and toothpaste was used up immediately -- my husband likes the slightly smaller head on the Pro-Health brushes, and the angle works well for him to get his back teeth. The toothpaste has always helped me keep my teeth white, ever since using an over the counter bleaching product a year ago. My husband even puts a dab of it on a sensitive tooth every night per instructions from his dentist, and it keeps the tooth from hurting. The floss was new for us, and I love it. Absolutely ADORE this floss, as it's a nice thickness so it can get out food particles (thin floss often passes right by it) but it's waxed enough that it comes out easily. The rinse is our least favorite. We use it on occasion, but there is a really nasty cloying taste to it, and we won't be buying it again."
3.00,"So I used the toothpaste but I am not a fan of it. When the lid is not tightly closed it runs out all over my vanity. It also left a weird aftertaste in my mouth. I would not purchase this again."
5.00,"nothing makes my mouth feel so clean and perfect. squeaky clean. its expensive but for good reasonings. some things you should never skip on price. your mouth being one. this protects your mouth better then most products out there. and it whitenes teeth. hitting two birds w one stall shall we? and when they say whitnening they stick behind there words unlike other products. a must love and have product in my bathroom and opinion."
5.00,"I loved this toothpaste. It made my whole mouth feel clean. I went and bought this for my whole family to use from now on."
5.00,"This toothpaste left my mouth feeling clean & fresh - another great product from Crest!"
5.00,"This is one of my favorite items on my Subscribe & Save list. It's a perfect two month supply for me and the wife. Has a good flavor that tastes fresh, but doesn't linger."
5.00,"My teeth feel clean and smooth. And knowing the great Crest reputation I know that I'm getting great protection against cavities and plaque."
4.00,"The mouthwash works really well and is tasty and refreshing."
1.00,"I have always taken very good care of my teeth. I brush and floss after every meal and after any snacks, and I then I use my waterpik.  The waterpik has been one of the best, most effective tools I have ever used.  Anyway, I moved a couple of years ago and had to find a new dentist.  The new hygienist began extolling the virtues of using mouthwash.  I told her I had never used it, and I never had problems with bad breath or anything else, but she continued to urge me to boost my routine by using this great new mouthwash--Crest Pro-Health.                                                                     Well, I decided to try it and see if I could detect any benefits from using it.  Not only could I not detect any benefits from using it, but I immediately noticed that it made my tongue, especially the tip, feel burnt, and the feeling lasted for many hours.  Then, my tongue would feel numb, especially the tip, and I noticed the rinse strongly interfered with my sense of taste, too.  I told the hygienist about my experience, and she said it must just be me because she had not heard of anyone else with these symptoms, and she continued to extoll the virtues of using mouthwash after every brushing.                                                                     Well, now I have a stain on my front teeth on top of everything else.  I have never had stains on my teeth before, and as I like to smile a lot, I have become profoundly self-conscious of smiling.  I thought I was the only one experiencing these problems until I decided to Google the Crest Pro-Health mouthwash for side effects.  It is good to know it is not just me experiencing these problems, but I am furious to know that after all of these people having the same problems the mouthwash is still on the market.  Obviously, the upshot here is DO NOT use this mouthwash!"
4.00,"Pro-Health Clinical is the new Crest line - excellent produce leaves my teeth feeling so clean and my mouth fresh."
4.00,"i love the freshness of the flavor and the way my mouth felt after brushing"
4.00,"it was a nice product. I did not really notice a difference between this and other toothpaste but I guess we will see at my next dentist appointment."
2.00,"This toothpaste seemed to work okay until a few minutes after I finished when there was just this flat bad taste in my mouth. The tube is a soft plastic with a flat lid, which I suppose is meant to let the toothpaste drop to the opening, but that really doesn't work. To get the last of the toothpaste out, one has to press the tube together; you cannot roll it up like a normal tube. This is a toothpaste that might work, but not with that lingering aftertaste."
4.00,"I loved the smooth feeling I had on my teeth after using the mouthwash, just like coming back from the dentist, just as you promised!"
5.00,"Tried and true, Crest is awesome! I've been using Crest for years and would recommend it to everyone!"
4.00,"My teeth felt clean and the taste was pretty good."
4.00,"My family thinks this toothpaste is great. It gets our teeth feeling really clean!"
5.00,"What can one say about a toothpaste? Let's start with taste, unlike several other multi-health toothpastes on the market, Crest Pro-Health for Life has a rather pleasant taste. I can say that I have not had any cavities since using this toothpaste and have had several check-ups that have been problem free. I should say that I also floss regularly and have also had fluoride treatments, so I can't say with complete confidence that my great check-ups are strictly on account of this toothpaste. But I can say this: I'm intending to stick with this brand as long as the streak continues."
3.00,"Toothpaste was fine. No better, no worse than any other brand."
1.00,"Years ago I used Crest Pro-health and I had no problems with it. But recently Crest apparently has decided to use a new formula and now I can't use it! When ever I wash my mouth, my tongue feels like it was burned and feeling numb. Yet it clearly states that it is Alcohol Free! So what's in it to cause this?! I have no clue. I bought my mouthwash from Costco. Great price until I was using it. Within a few days, my tongue felt like it was burned. When I touched my tongue, it was very rough. Also my tongue was feeling numb. Luckily I stopped using it before it got any worse. I read online many have paid the price using the mouthwash. When I went to the stores, many people told me to use ACT or Listerine. Look, you may not like the burning Alcohol used in Mouthwash, but I prefer that over a burned and numb tongue. I want my Taste Buds intact! Also don't use Crest Pro-Health Toothpaste. Crest apparently changed the formula and people are complaining everywhere I go. Stay away from the Crest Pro-health series. Stick to Listerine or Act."
5.00,"My husband and I both used this product. Having a product that controls plaque is important to us. After using the sample we went out and bought the full sized product. I have felt that this toothpaste is doing a good job controlling (and reducing) plaque on my teeth. I'm a believer---I will continue to use this product!"
5.00,"The Crest Pro-Health are my favorite oral care products. I love the taste of the toothpaste and the clean feeling it leaves. I also really enjoy using the rinse."
2.00,"I don't really feel any different with others, the price are so high, the only thing attract me is the package, it looks so nice, that's all."
5.00,"My husband turned me on to this toothpaste. Really like it. Guess I will find out at the next dentist appt. if it's as good as it says."
4.00,"Im used to using listerine pre rinse whiting, but I noticed a bit of a better whiting with the crest"
4.00,"I liked using Crest Pro-Health Plaque Control, but most of all I liked the lasting clean feeling it left in my mouth."
5.00,"Not a bad taste and didn't burn or sting when using it"
3.00,"the taste wasn't all that great and also I don't think this product leaves your teeth feeling clean enough."
5.00,"I was highly impressed, it made my teeth feel incredible,and it wasn't too harsh."
5.00,"This Crest toothpaste left my mouth feeling clean and fresh. The mint flavor is refreshing. I will purchase this again."
5.00,"I am so impressed with the Crest Pro Health series of toothpastes! It has made a remarkable difference in our family's mouths, especially in the area of healthier gum tissue. Will definitely be buying this again!"
5.00,"Made my teeth feel smooth and clean. Better than going to the Dentist office."
5.00,"The new Crest Clinical rinse leaves my teeth feeling super clean and my mouth feeling super fresh. I will definitely continue using this product!!"
4.00,"I received a sample of Crest Pro-Health Plaque Control Toothpaste. The sample was small so I was only able to use it for 2 brushes. The toothpaste had a nice, fresh taste and left my mouth feeling clean. I like a lot of bubbles and I didn't find that with this product but overall it cleaned my teeth well and that is what's most important!"
5.00,"The Clinical mouthwash is fantastic! It tastes wonderful and leaves my breath fresh and my teeth infinitely whiter. I also like the way my teeth feel...smooth and plaque free. I certainly see this as better then the average mouth wash and worth the investment. I also like the shape of the bottle! Plus you do use less, so the product ends up being cheaper then watery alternatives that you literally pour down the drain. I most sincerely recommend this product!"
5.00,"I LOVE this toothpaste! I love the texture of it; it leaves my mouth feeling so clean!"
5.00,"great product, love the fresh feeling in my mouth."
5.00,"After using the plaque control, my teeth felt cleaner and smoother! Just like after the dentist office!"
3.00,"I really like how this made my teeth feel, but I didn't care for the taste of it. I am really particular on how toothpast taste, and I wasn't a big fan. When my husband used it, he liked what it did to his teeth and what it tasted like."
5.00,"This product makes my teeth feel like I just left the dentist! It's great!"
4.00,"I love the mouthwash the best. Toothpaste is great but my mouth felt so clean after using the mouthwash. It was cool, refreshing, and clean feeling. The taste is pleasant and I would definitely recommend to friends"
4.00,"this mouthwash kept my mouth feeling refreshed all day. nice flavor, not too overpowering, yet effective."
5.00,"This product has changed my mind about mouth washes. Crest Pro Clinical Rinse is a product like no other. I enjoy the flavor and I'm very happy it doesn't have alcohol. It makes my mouth feel fresh and clean."
5.00,"Product loyalty ... that is me when it comes to Crest. This was a great price for this and I like this flavor a lot. So thank you."
4.00,"I've got a couple of sensitive teeth and had been using Sensodyne. Since using the Crest Pro-health, I'm still doing well when it comes to sensitivity and I like the idea that this product is designed to target so many other issues. Dental health is more important than most people realize. A problem with your mouth affects your overall health. I was surprised to hear that as you get older you face more dental challenges. Never thought about it before, but it does make sense. Since I generally don't notice any of the other issues, I probably won't know if this product does everything it claims in the other areas. Maybe my dentist will see a difference. The texture is smooth, perhaps a little pastier than what I've recently used. The taste is a light mint, much lighter than most mint-flavored products and doesn't linger very long after brushing. Amended I found I have to keep the tube in an upright position in a glass, otherwise the toothpaste will leak out of the nozzle, causing waste and a mess. The problem could be easily taken care of by the manufacturer if they replaced the flip-up cap with an old fashioned screw-on type."
5.00,"I loved it my mouth never feltso fresh. I will be buying this tooth paste from now on."
4.00,"My husband is picky when it comes to toothpaste. If he tries it once and doesn't like it, he won't use it again. He was very impressed with Crest ProHealth toothpaste and has requested it for the future."
5.00,"Loved this product. Helped with my sensitive teeth so the cold and hot didn't hurt. My teeth feel cleaner and whiter. Great product and I highly recommend Crest Pro Health Toothpaste."
1.00,"I used to love Crest Pro-Health toothpaste until I realized that it was actually staining my teeth (and not white)! If you read the fine print on the tube, it even attests to this! I switched brands immediately and noticed that my teeth were whiter within a few days. I am appalled that a product could actually do the opposite of what it is intended to do and under such a big name brand."
5.00,"Crest's \"Pro-Health\" line of teeth care products imply without any explanation that they are superior to run of the mill toothpastes and mouth washes. So how exactly is it different? I went to the drug store and looked at the ingredients in the Crest's other toothpaste lines, such as \"Crest Complete\" and \"Crest with an Extra Advantage.\" The active ingredient in all of them is 0.243% sodium fluoride. Pro-Health toothpaste, instead, has 0.454% stannous fluoride. There's no explanation about the benefits of stannous vs. sodium fluoride -- either there is none, or Crest doesn't want to dwell on this, making all of its sodium fluoride toothpastes out to be inferior. I can detect a difference in the taste. Pro-health has a bit more of a fluoride flavor. That is, the artificial flavoring is not as strong as the other Crest lines. Either way, the toothpaste works well, but admittedly, I don't know if it's working better than non-Pro-Health line toothpaste."
4.00,"Enjoyed the product. Helps to keep my teeth lookng white"
4.00,"I have been using the paste for about a week now and it's ok. The past itself is a little runny for me, so I feel like I will use it a lot faster than others. I will continue to use because I prefere crest over other products. I just had my dental exam and I want to see if the results will be different or about the same on my next visit."
5.00,"My mouth and breath felt fresh and clean for hours."
4.00,"I used the Crest Pro Health Clinical Gum Control toothpaste. It worked really well."
1.00,"I first started using this toothpaste and the first two days were fine.  Then I noticed that my mouth was extremely dry all the time and no matter how much water I drank it still was dry.  Then I started feeling like I had sores on my tounge and my gums and the inside of my cheeks.  It got so bad that it felt like I had just gotten dental work done in my whole mouth.  I only used this toothpaste for a little over a week before I couldn't take it any more.  The day I stopped using it my mouth felt a little better.  I am upset that there is no warning label or side effects on the label about this since it seems to happen to a lot of people that have used it.  Crest needs to fix this problem.  DONT BUY IT!"
4.00,"My teeth felt cleaner and smoother. And it didn't taste bad either."
1.00,"Like other reviewers here, I used Crest Pro Health and had adverse reactions.  It burned my mouth--gums, tounge, and all!  After an hour or so,  my mouth and tounge started peeling thick strips of flesh--it was totally gross and painful.  Just to be sure it was the toothpaste, and not related to something else, I tried it in isolation a couple of more times with the same sickening results! I have never had any similar reaction from any other toothpaste. I am not a chemist, but they must be putting in something questionable, or something normally considered safe but at such a high degree of concentration, or just some odd combination of chemicals for it to affect so many people in this fashion.  I contacted P&amp;G (makers of the toothpaste) using the email on the toothpaste tube/box and did receive a reply from them--the reply acted as if they never heard of this problem before, but it is all over the Internet about the concerns people are having with Crest Pro Health.  Just Google it.  Now, with so many complaints, P&amp;G should come out and let the public know if this toothpase is truly harmful and what,if any, might be the risks in using it.  I assume P&amp;G is a responsible complany, so come on P&amp;G, tell us what's going on with Crest Pro Health?  If it is truly dangerous, of course it should be immediately withdrawn by P&amp;G and they should assist those suffering from use of their product.  If it is safe, they should still put out warnings that use of it may burn your mouth, cause peeling of skin, etc.  Consumers should know beforehand so we would know before we purchase and not be so alarmed if/when something adverse happens."
5.00,"This toothpaste is awesome. My whole family loves it. The kids are actually willing to brush without being asked!"
5.00,"Love when the kids come out of the bathroom and tell me their breath feels clean!!"
4.00,"Good product from a great company. Made in the USA!"
5.00,"I love this product! It makes your breath fresh and clean and it lasts a long time. I also love that it doesn't burn your mouth! I will definitely purchase this product again!"
5.00,"5 star rating Thick and minty - but very good for oral health - keeping teeth and gums healthy My favorite toothpaste"
4.00,"Toothpaste is toothpaste? Nope! It really made my teeth feel cleaner and it lasted a long time too. I liked the taste as well. My breath was fresh. Will buy it again."
5.00,"I really enjoyed the use of this product. It left my teeth feeling like I had just left the dentist - and for a lot less money than having my teeth cleaned professionally"
4.00,"It really left my teeth feeling cleaner longer. The taste is great, would buy again."
1.00,"I don't understand why this product is allowed to remain on the market. I purchased it last week, and soon after, I knew something was off. My mouth started burning for no reason. Food began tasting weird. Drinks all tasted carbonated. I ordered white wine at a nice restaurant and believed it was champagne. I had no idea what was wrong. Then I remembered this mouthwash and knew it was the culprit. Now I can only hope that the damage isn't permanent. Be very cautious with this product."
5.00,"loved this product had a great taste and left your mouth feeling clean"
5.00,"I tried all of the Crest Pro products at the same time. I also had my 19 year old son switch with me. We we both very please with the tooth brush, rinse and tooth paste. Even though neither of us has been to a dentist in a while, our teeth felt cleaner and looked better. We aren't bit flossers around here, but made an effort to floss every day and liked the way our teeth looked an flet afterwards. Flossing may become a new habit!"
5.00,"I have to say...I really loved this toothpaste. The flavour, the clean feeling. This is a must try."
5.00,"Crest pro health toothpaste is a great product. Leaves your mouth feeling clean and fresh. Love using it."
4.00,"The minty flavor seems to last a longer time than my normal toothpaste. It leaves my mouth with an overall fresh clean feeling."
5.00,"I tried the new Crest Pro-Health toothpaste Sensitive + Enamel Shield and this product is awesome. It makes my teeth feel so clean and smooth and the flavor of the paste is mild and pleasing. I have extreme sensitive teeth, but this product allows me to enjoy foods that I was not able to enjoy before due to sensitivity. I love the Crest Pro-Health line of products and are my go to favorites."
3.00,"I am a long long user of Crest Pro Health toothpaste. I like the way my teeth and mouth feel after using them. I feel the price of the Clinical Pro Health was too high. Because of this I will continue using my regular Pro Health."
5.00,"I have been using Crest Pro Health for about 2 years and I love everything about it. Last time I went to the dentist, he told me that my gums and teeth have never looked healthier. I would definitely recommend this to everybody! The price could be a little lower but it's great when you can find a value pack."
5.00,"Arrived superfast. I know it will sound a little vierd, but I love the taste of this toothpaste. Keeps your mouth really fresh for a long time."
4.00,"The Crest Pro Health toothpaste tastes great and seems to do a good job keeping my mouth clean. Crest advocates an entire regimen of related products, which I have not done. While I like this toothpaste - when I want a really clean feeling I will stick to my Arm & Hammer with baking soda."
5.00,"love it it works great i will deff buy it againand recomend this to other people thanks"
5.00,"A lot of toothpastes taste awful. Not only did this taste good, but the clean lasted through most of the day. I honestly felt like it was doing exactly what it claimed it was (which is always really hard to tell with toothpaste)"
5.00,"This is the best sensitive teeth toothpaste that i have ever used. The others leave you with a less than clean feeling. I can really tell a difference after just a week."
5.00,"I really liked it and thought it worked great.I will keep using it"
5.00,"I have not used crest much in the past but the mouthwash was awesome. I noticed a difference right away after starting to use it. Great product and I have recommended to friends"
5.00,"great product wish the sample lasted longer thanks"
5.00,"The toothpaste I bought from Amazon has more paste than the ones sold in local stores. Although both toothpastes from Amazon and local stores have the same size, but Amazon's toothpaste look and feel more fulfilled in pastes than local stores' toothpaste. What a valuable buy!"
5.00,"The toothpaste had a great flavor and left my teeth feeling very clean."
5.00,"After using cheaper toothpaste for a while, I was reminded once again why Crest Pro-Health rocks! So clean!"
5.00,"We usually buy Colgate toothpaste...but just wanted to give this a shot seeing the good reviews. My 6 and 3 yr olds love it! Yummy was the word used :)"
5.00,"I'm really pleased with this product! Just what I hoped for."
5.00,"I have used Crest for a long time, so welcome this new product. I need help with keeping my teeth cavity free, and I feel like this product will be a big help."
4.00,"I liked this mouthwash because it didn't sting or burn like so many others do. Left my mouth feeling fresh. The only reason it didn't get 5 stars was because of the price."
4.00,"Crest Pro Health Toothpase and Rinse make a dynamic duo for oral health care. They leave teeth clean, healthy, and well cared for."
4.00,"The best thing about this, is that if you use it as recommended (brush no more than twice at the most three times a day preferably after meals) it really does the trick it whitens extremely well and makes your teeth less sensitive to bacteria and plaque I've gotten this about four days ago and immediately noticeable difference in my teeth's appearance and glossiness the thing is if you brush gently, no more than twice or at most three times a day after each meal and floss it reduces the inflammation in your gums also if you think you are getting mouth ulcers really this is what I advise: (in my humble opinion) the less you stress out about it the better just remember to use as recommended drink salt water to rinse and delay the bacteria and bad breath you should avoid eating spicy foods like avocado to prevent mouth ulcers or from stress or what ever else I also drink coconut water and swish my mouth out with it to alkalize the oral environment in my mouth and it helps my bad breath as well... Take my advice or leave it. This is as honest as I get."
4.00,"I thought this product made my teeth feel squeaky clean, Made other family members try it and got rave reviews!"
4.00,"After-taste was not bad, could use more flavor, would like a stronger mint flavor. Teeth feel clean and smooth after brushing."
5.00,"I love the fresh feeling my mouth has after using this toothpaste!"
5.00,"I love this toothpaste. It's the only toothpaste I'll use now. It leaves my teeth feeling clean and my breath is fresh all day."
5.00,"I am always looking for the next \"best\" toothpaste... I really care about the look and health of my teeth... it's the first thing I notice about someone I meet... this Crest ProHealth clinical toothpaste was wonderful. I would recommend trying it for yourself and I would buy again in future."
5.00,"Crest Pro Health Toothpaste leaves your teeth feeling like you just went to the dentist."
4.00,"Love this tooth paste! Keeps my teeth feeling clean!"
4.00,"I love the new flip-top covers on Crest products. Makes it EASY to apply paste to the brush and it's impossible to let the cap roll anywhere! The paste itself is fine. No unpleasant taste and my teeth feel very clean after using this. The ONLY reason I don't give it 5 stars is because it contains fluoride (which our teeth do NOT need, despite the common belief)."
5.00,"THIS PRODUCT LEFT MY MOUTH FEELING CLEAN, FRESHENED MY BREATHE AND TASTE VERY MINTY."
3.00,"I enjoy the flavor & texture of this toothpaste. I haven't had any of the soreness others have mentioned. I do get filmy stuff on the insides of my cheeks a couple minutes after I brush though it goes away soon & doesn't bother me any. This side effect does seem to be lessened if I rinse well with water after brushing. It doesn't help with my sensitivity as well as Sensodyne or other toothpastes marketed for such. I can't attest to it helping with gingivitis as I don't have that problem but was using this rather as a preventative. I have been having a problem with chapped lips lately which I never had before & while I can't say for sure that its caused by this toothpaste, the other reviewers have got me wondering. To me this is just another ordinary toothpaste."
5.00,"As other reviewers who like this said. I find it really hard to believe that this could make peoples mouth sore. But everyone's different. I am now tackling gingivitus with the help of this to prevent it from getting worse, & hopefully better. I like this pastes texture way better then the original Pro health which is more watery. I have converted from Colgate Total and Please Crest do not! stop making this. Some of us need it to tackle everything it does. I feel my gums becoming more soothed and gradually pink again hopefully to stay that way with the help of this product. I sometimes think that the negative reviewers are from competitors. I am an honest consumer of this. Get it esp if you are tackling gingivitus!"
5.00,"This product has everything needed for a Great toothpaste. Excellent. I would recommend this toothpaste to anyone. Cleans teeth very well and leaves your mouth feeling clean and fresh. I also like the fact that it has the ADA approval."
5.00,"After using Crest Clinical Plaque Control my mouth felt like so clean just like it does when I leave the dentist office after a cleaning. It's so nice to finally come across a product that gives me that feeling everyday."
5.00,"Love the way it made mouth feel. Would definitely recommend everyone to try it."
4.00,"This toothpaste was pretty good, but I didn't notice that much difference from other kinds or brands. It left my mouth feeling great, and I felt good about giving my teeth an extra clean!"
5.00,"This product not only works just as well if not even better than some of the more expensive ones it even has a pleasant taste. It has helped whiten my teeth. Some friends even thought I had an expensive dental treatment. I have recommended it many times already."
5.00,"I loved the toothpaste! My mouth felt really clean - it's just a little pricier than my normal brand."
5.00,"love crest products and amazed that they still keep coming up with better products. Very clean feeling and just by reading the box and seeing advertisement, I understand the research and consideration put into the product. Not abrasive and great for my minor sensitivity"
5.00,"I'll definitely be buying this again! Doesn't burn and leaves my mouth feeling clean!"
4.00,"We tried the crest pro health clinical rinse. We could feel the deep cleaning and tightening of our gums. It felt like a better rinse after just one time. Our family has made the switch to this product."
5.00,"I can't understand why people have such a poor evaluation of this toothpaste. It is not all that different than most other toothpastes. The sensitivity protection is through the addition of potassium to the product, which most regular toothpastes don't have. Other than that it is pretty much the same.                           Anyway, for me, it cured my sensitive teeth. I have been using this toothpaste for years! I do NOT get sores, dry mouth anywhere, build up of anything, or any of the other bad side effects that others describe. I am NOT saying they don't get them, simply that if you have sensitive teeth, using this toothpaste for a few months will fix the problem. And don't expect it to be fixed in a few days - it does take months of use.                           I have not had any experience getting this here, but will do so as it is a bit cheaper. I will update my review once I know how the product arrives, expiration date, etc."
4.00,"This product made my mouth feel very clean with out the harsh burning. Will try again"
4.00,"Only brand my family and I use! Keeps our mouths healthy and clean."
4.00,"It's great. I've used Crest Pro Health Clinical sensitive and it does great. But I really don't see a difference between that and the regular pro health sensitive."
5.00,"I have used this toothpaste for quite awhile. It uses Stannous fluoride instead of Potassium Nitrate as the anti-sensitivity ingredient! It works and I love the flavor (cinnamon) and the light gritty texture. Craig S."
5.00,"THIS CREST PRO HEALTH CLINICAL TOOTHPASTE HAS A GREAT TASTE AND IT MAKES MY TEETH AND GUMS FEEL GREAT . I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE..."
5.00,"Alcohol should only burn your mouth if you're at the bar doing shots of Bacardi 101, or if you're in Kentucky trying out Bubba's home-brewed moonshine; NOT in the bathroom before heading to work. Crest's no-burn, alcohol-free mouthwash does the trick by getting your mouth squeaky-clean without the burn, simply put. I found that you don't get the same \"cool breath\" feel, but as long as it feels clean, who cares? Plus, you're able to swish longer for a better clean!"
4.00,"I really liked how fresh my mouth felt, but I wasn't thrilled with the fakey-mint flavor."
4.00,"I love using this toothpaste it makes your teeth clean and smooth and feeling fresh. I would use again."
5.00,"I got this toothpaste from an Amazon Warehouse deal at a great price and it works pretty good. There's a bit of 'grit' in the toothpaste, which I'm not sure if that's why it was a warehouse deal or if I'm just not use to having as much of a 'grit' taste in my toothpaste but it seems to clean my teeth pretty well. I've been using it with                                               and I've noticed an improvement in oral hygiene, not that it was bad before but it's great now."
5.00,"Item is better than I expected and I'd recommend it to anyone"
3.00,"- Brand name Crest Mouth wash - Lacked a sense of strength because its got a weak taste to it, wondered if it was able to do what its supposed to with such a bland taste. - Ordered it once, but switched to ACT and am happier with that (see my other review). - Shipping was fast with Amazon."
5.00,"I absolutely recommend this product. It left my mounth feeling very clean and the freshness lasted for hours."
4.00,"this mouthwash worked well for my family and we like it. it keeps your mouth fresh and kills germs too. we will buy it again."
5.00,"I had not tried the Crest pro-health mouthwash previously before receiving a sample. I loved it! I loved how clean and refreshing my mouth felt."
5.00,"I'm nuts about this toothpaste. It tastes so good, feels so fresh, and has just the right texture. I ordered it online so I'd have a stock of it if they ever stop making it!"
5.00,"This is great tooth paste. It really does make your teeth feel like you were just at the dentist."
4.00,"I have been using this brand/flavour of toothpaste for a few years now. What can I say? The value of the twin pack on amazon is good. The flavor is a good balance of \"freshness\" without being over powering or strong. It leaves my mouth feeling clean. This toothpaste has the larger flip top style top, as opposed to the smaller, screw on tops. I find the flip tops help keep things cleaner. It can be a little hard to get that very last bit of toothpaste out, so it's good to stock up and have a backup."
1.00,"Just curious-- I did not buy from amazon but I'm just an average person.  Very bad experience with this toothpaste.  Blisters, swollen mouth and lips, very dry mouth and burned lips, sore throat... Is this an allergy?  It does not seem to affect everyone who uses it. No permanent damage.:). It hurt quite a bit but changed toothpaste to \"no Sls\" and all is well again .  Would not recommend at all.  Should have warnings on the box."
5.00,"This was a wonderful product. It made my teeth feel wonderful. Thanks for sharing!"
5.00,"I tried the Pro-Health Clinical products from Crest and liked all of them. I like the feel of the toothbrush. I feel it really gets to all the nooks and crannies in my teeth. The floss is also easy to use and really glides between the teeth. My true test will be when I go to the dentist and they barely, if at all, have to clean the plaque off my teeth. Thanks Vocalpoint for a chance to try the products."
1.00,"I bought a bottle of this after my last cleaning. The hygienist told me I was a candidate for gum disease, which put the fear of dentures into me. Unlike a few other reviewers, I never noticed any chemical burns. This rinse was pleasant to use for a few days. It wasn't as intense as some of the Listerine brands I had used in the past, and I actually enjoyed the peroxide foaminess that persisted for a minute after spitting it out. My teeth were feeling clean, but after about 10 days of consistent use (twice per day in the morning and bedtime) I noticed I wasn't tasting anything. Coffee, salt, soda, spices -- everything went dull and flat. There was also a strange metallic chemical taste in my mouth throughout the day which seemed to be getting stronger. I stopped using it about a week ago, and switched to Listerine Ultraclean. I have regained most of my sense of taste, and the metallic taste is mostly gone. I wouldn't recommend using this stuff unless there is a specific reason, and only then, not for more than a week or so."
1.00,"I just bought this Crest Pro Health Clinical Gum Protection today and upon my first use after rinsing out with water my mouth was noticeably somewhere between dry and foamy. I ignored it thinking this was suppose to happen and that I'd get used to it but no more than 30 minutes later I'm pulling the stringy white slime out of my mouth. I checked my mouth in the mirror and see that my gums and cheeks look as if they're pealing off creating this white stringy slime. I immediately looked this up online and see that so many people are having the same experience. I've never had this happen before. Immediately discontinuing use! I highly recommend trashing this product. Thank you Crest for the scare!"
5.00,"I loved this product! It was the best! I liked how it made my teeth feel and it was so refreshing."
5.00,"We now use this brand of toothpaste and mouthwash for our whole family. It does have a light minty taste as the other reviewer mentions, however we did not taste the licorice taste. (I do understand that taste as we have had that happen with a certain brand of gum - one package all I could taste was black licorice, which I can't stand and next was fine) May have been a fluke batch. Anyway, we like this brand as it seems to be the only one that really gets rid of the \"bad breath\" smell in our kids. Would buy this again."
5.00,"I love this toothpaste! It makes my teeth and mouth feel cleaner for longer. No other toothpaste makes your teeth feel this clean, and keep your teeth this healthy."
5.00,"This toothpaste was an excellent product. I was quite pleased with the results."
5.00,"I loved the toothpaste. It really kept my teeth clean and clean feeling for much longer than regular toothpaste."
5.00,"I tried the Crest pro-health and thought it did a superb job. I hadn't used Crest toothpaste in awhile and I was very pleased with results! My teeth felt very clean and they looked whiter."
4.00,"Good taste, brushes well, teeth feel clean. Cannot rate effectiveness of tartar control as I have not yet visited the dentist this year."
5.00,"Crest purportedly \"reduces surface stains by 80%.\" Disclaimer: I've used one tube of the pro-health whitening gel toothpaste and my teeth do appear a bit whiter. But it's obviously such a subjective judgment at this point, I may also be mistaken. But I can confidently say this is now my favorite toothpaste. I absolutely love the mint flavor and the texture. It lasts on the brush for a sustained, vigorous brushing, and yet cleans off quite easily. And no toothpaste sediment left on the sink, under my brush like with its competitor. My only, minor, complaint - the flip top on the tube broke almost immediately."
5.00,"I love this rinse! Leaves your mouth feeling clean without the medicine taste of other rinses."
5.00,"This is an absolutely amazing product. I really wish they would lower the price just a little bit though.,...."
5.00,"I love this product. I didn't believe that it would make my teeth whiter until I tried it. There was a noticable difference after a week."
5.00,"I was really impressed with the products. I was especially happy that when you used the mouthwash it did not burn your mouth and the toothpaste had a great flavor also. Yes both kept your mouth clean just like if you were coming from the dentist. It is a great product and I would recommend to everyone."
5.00,"Works better than the vivid brand toothpastes for me."
4.00,"I liked this product because there was no overwhelming alcohol taste like with other mouth wash."
5.00,"Love the fresh from a dental cleaning feeling that this Crest toothpaste gives me!"
5.00,"I love that the flavor is not over powering. I have been using Pro-health products for years with perfect check ups every time! Love it!!"
4.00,"After using the toothpaste you feel like you just left the dentist after having your teeth cleaned."
4.00,"I used this product about a week before I starting feeling like my teeth were smoother. I would recommend this product for long term use as it seems to do what it was intended for, to remove plaque."
5.00,"My mouth felt extremely clean after using this product and the feeling seemed to last a long while."
5.00,"my teeth actually feel smooth and clean after using this.i will keep brushing with this."
5.00,"I'm not sure what people are upset about here. My gums and tongue don't hurt as other reviewers have noted. In fact, this is a great product for me. This toothpaste is meant to help people with gum disease, and thats exactly what its doing. I've noticed my gums are getting pinker and i've been using for about 3 or 4 weeks now.                                              The side effects are hardly as dramatic as other reviewers here. I do occasionally get the dead tissue in my mouth but i used to get that with whitening mouthwash, its hardly a huge problem. If you have bad gum disease like i do, these side effects are not enough to convince me to stop using.                                              If you have gingivitis or periodontis even, this product is for you! Don't let the low reviews prevent you from giving this a shot....what do you have to loose? $4 as opposed to improving your gum health??"
1.00,"This awful mouthwash ruined my teeth! It turned them brown! They should not even be allowed to sell this product."
4.00,"This product was the best for removing and keeping plague off my teeth."
5.00,"I’ve been using Crest products for some years. I floss twice a day using the pro-health floss which has a minty flavor. I like the angle of the tooth brush and the pro-health plaque control tooth paste. It leaves my mouth feeling clean, fresh and healthy."
5.00,"My mom told me about Crest Pro Health a few years ago. I've been using it ever since. I can totally tell a difference when I have to use other toothpastes. They just aren't good!"
4.00,"I really enjoyed this product. The mouthwash really made my mouth feel clean and fresh. And the best part was when I did it at night before I went to bed I didn't wake up the next morning with horrible sleep breath. I also love how I have that really clean feeling after I use it. Very impressed."
5.00,"Teeth felt very clean after use with a great taste."
4.00,"I thought this had a good flavor, but the paste was very gritty. My teeth did feel very clean & my mouth felt fresh."
3.00,"I have purchased this product but do not enjoy the taste. I use this product primarily for the plaque prevention feature. It does not make my breath feel fresh."
4.00,"I enjoyed the toothpaste. Of course I am a pretty loyal crest user. leave my teeth feeling clean"
1.00,"This toothpaste has absolutely torn up my mouth.  My mouth burns so badly that my son asked if he could see it.  I flipped down my lower lip and he said, \"Mommy, you are bleeding!\"  I didn't believe him so I looked in the mirror and sure enough, I was bleeding through tiny little pin holes in my lip.  I also have canker-like sores in my mouth and tongue.  I used this product last year and had to stop because my mouth was hurting so I switched toothpastes.  I forgot about it and used it again recently.  Within days, my mouth developed sores.  I do not have gingivitis but used it because I received it from my dentist.  It's an awful toothpaste for me, but perhaps for people with gingivitis it is worth it."
5.00,"All the Crest products I have ever used are great!"
5.00,"My two year old loves Jake and the Neverland pirates. He saw the toothbrush at Target one day and begged for it. Having an interest in hygiene is great so I got it. But then he saw the picture of the toothpaste on the pack and refused to buy any other kind. They were out of the toothpaste. When we got home he really wanted to use his new buzzing toothbrush but he was still sad about not having the toothpaste to match. Since we got it, he's been asking to brush his teeth 3+ times a day"
5.00,"Very good product, great tasting too. After using my mouth feels good."
5.00,"Crest complete totally cleans your teeth an makes your mouth feel fresh and clean."
5.00,"I love this toothpaste for its whitening results as well as the texture of the product. You can tell right away that it's doing its job!"
4.00,"The clinical gum protection toothpaste left my teeth feeling very clean. It's not like other crest products I've used that left my mouth feeling dry and kind of pasty. This toothpaste has a great minty flavor and not too strong. A great product for me"
4.00,"Other reviewers are wondering what the difference is between this version for the aging 50+ crowd and the Health for Life versions for other stages of life. I searched and finally found it in small print right there on the bottle: this one doesn't contain alcohol, and it's specifically to give a milder sensation in the mouth without all that wincing and stinging you experience with Listerine-type products.The product seems to work to slightly freshen your mouth after brushing. They take care to urge you to make sure all toothpaste is washed away from your mouth before using this. I can't help wondering if it would cause an unpleasant or unhealthy chemical reaction if the two were mixed.I'll keep using this for a while, and then we'll see what my hygienist and dentist say at my next regular checkup. I can't tell for sure whether it's reducing or removing plaque, keeping gingivitis in check, or whatever.I do admit that I'm missing that stronger \"bite\" of the stuff with alcohol. It seems to make my mouth feel cleaner and fresher and wash away more of whatever coating was there when alcohol is included. It's a smooth feel, leaving you wanting more. We'll just have to see whether it does the job. I'll update this eventually."
5.00,"I have always used Crest and their new products are wonderful. I will continue to use them."
4.00,"I've been using this for years. It's made a big difference in my dental visits. I don't get the build up I used to. This does not contain alcohol--which I usually prefer but if you want alcohol this isn't for you."
5.00,"Pro health Crest is a great new product. I loved the way it left my teeth feeling clean and healthy. Just like a visit from the dental hygenist! I will definately by this product again and recommend it to my friends."
5.00,"tooth paste is great, really helps in controlling buildup, teeth felt clean after use"
4.00,"I am a Crest fan, so the opportunity to try this was fabulous."
5.00,"I tried pro health to keep gingivitis at bay. My teeth and gums are so much cleaner. It is a pleasure to brush my teeth now and there isn't a unpleasant aftertaste."
5.00,"great product and i would most definitely rebuy again. Has made my teeth feel very clean after brushing and doesn't taste horrible like some toothpaste does. great job crest!!"
5.00,"I really love the crest pro health line of toothpastes. The flavors are great tasting."
4.00,"Fresh taste, and seems to work well! Left my mouth feeling fresh and clean"
4.00,"This product really made my teeth feel very clean!"
5.00,"This toothpaste reminds me of the paste used at the dentist's office. It has the granular texture which gives you the feeling that your teeth are really clean when you are done. It freshens your breath too. I will definitely buy this product again."
5.00,"i found this product to be absolutely amazing.Helps keepyour mouth clean and fresh for a long time.I love it and have continued to buy it even after my sample."
1.00,"This toothpaste is unhealthy.                                                                     All one has to do is a search using the product's name and \"consumer complaints\" - the reading material is a wake-up call."
5.00,"Not sure what's going on with all those negative reviews? Could it be possible to have had the product contaminated somehow? I have never purchased it through Amazon, but am about to. I've been using this mouth rinse for 3 or 4 years (maybe longer) since my dentist gave me a sample and recommended it, saying it was alcohol free and that it shows the food particles you're rinsing away.                                                                     It's been a great product to use. No ill effects to taste buds or anything ever. I followed my dental hygienist's directions, and swish for about 15 seconds (although I think the she said 30)after I floss. And I'm always amazed at  the food particles it \"picks up\"/washes away. Sometimes, I'll go back and floss again and rinse again after eating a particularly crumbly item that gets in your teeth (like roasted almonds), and it lets you know when all the food particles that cause plaque are gone.                                                                     I would highly recommend this product."
3.00,"A lot of people are complaining of the flavor and taste, especially with eating food or drinking. I have no problems with it affecting the taste of my food or my taste buds. The back of the label says to wait 30-minutes before eating or drinking. I generally use this twice a day in the morning and evening. For me, it does leave a a brownish stain between my teeth and my brushing and flossing does not remove the stains. I believe the stain is caused by the chemical that coats your teeth to protect from cavities. The label clearly mentions that this is normal and that it is *not* a permanent stain. It comes off if you stop using the product or go to get your teeth cleaned at the dentist. For me, the brown staining is unrecognizable unless you are really up close looking at my teeth. The teeth staining caused by this product may be a turn-off for many people. Other than that, I have no complaints about this product. I do intend to try other products for the sake of exploration after I am done with my bottle."
5.00,"Really left me with a fresher ,healthier feel in my mouth than my other rinse!"
4.00,"I love the taste! Thanks for the chance to try it !"
5.00,"Great product - made my teeth feel like they were just cleaned! Better yet - my hygienist said my teeth were in great shape and to keep up what I am doing!!"
5.00,"I love this toothpaste. It really makes my entire mouth feel clean!"
4.00,"I like the pro health toothpaste. It left my mouth and teeth feeling clean and fresh."
4.00,"I love the Crest Pro Health toothpaste. I've used a different kind of toothpaste regularly for a few years, but after brushing with Pro Health, I've noticed how much cleaner my teeth feel overnight and between brushings."
5.00,"I loved how my teeth and mouth felt after repeated use!"
5.00,"I tried the Crest Pro Health Rinse. What a great product. It's just the right strength. I've find some to be too overpowering with a horrible aftertaste. Some products are also too weak. The Crest Pro Health rinse was perfect!!"
5.00,"I really enjoyed the taste of this product over the brand I've been using for 20+ years. My mouth and especially my teeth at the base of my gums felt so clean and smooth after using it. My daughter is in school for Dental Hygienist, when I asked her about this brand she stated that it was the only kind her professors & Dentist at the college recommend! Nice to know!"
5.00,"I like this product line. It's a little pricey and I haven't used it long enough to notice significant changes. But, I like it enough that I'd buy it again if given a chance."
4.00,"I'm not a big fan of alcohol in mouthwash, so I was grateful to realize that this particular one was alcohol free. Why is that important? Because alcohol can be absorbed through the mucous membranes of the mouth. Being friends with people taking Antabuse, I know they are cautioned about using mouthwash for that very reason.Because of that, this is safe for kids as well as adults.The flavor - I am much more used to a milder flavor with wintergreen. This has a very strong, almost biting flavor. But it does leave me with a clean feeling in my mouth. At the time I tested this, I had a severe ear infection and was unable to open my mouth except for the tiniest amount. Because of this, brushing my teeth resulted in extreme pain, and I was worried about whether I had done a decent job - so having this to (hopefully) do what it says was a great relief.The star is taken off because I really did find it too strong for my personal preference."
5.00,"My teeth felt so clean and the taste was great. I would recommend to anyone"
5.00,"Crest Plaque Control did a super job of making my teeth feel like they had just been cleaned at the dentist office. I plan to purchase again and make sure my entire family has the opportunity to use it too."
4.00,"This was a good product and has a refreshing taste."
5.00,"My dentist Recommended this line of crest products and I have to admit I like how well it works. I use this in the morning and sensodyne before bed."
3.00,"I only used the toothpaste twice. Nothing new found so far. But will continue to use."
5.00,"I actually loved this product. It made my mouth feel clean and gave me fresh breath. I also felt like I came straight from the dentist!!"
3.00,"Overall I thought that the Crest pro health toothpaste was a good product."
5.00,"I immediately noticed the difference compared to the regular Crest I normally use. I will definitely purchase. Great product."
5.00,"I like the Crest brand of toothpaste and that is works well."
5.00,"I love the feeling of smooth,clean teeth after using this toothpaste. It works all day and keeps my breathe fresh. I highly reccomend!!!"
5.00,"This made my teeth feel as fresh and clean as if I had just been to the dentist. Loved it!"
5.00,"My husband and i really loved the way this worked.It was a refreshing mouthwash so i will keep this in stock!"
3.00,"I would actually prefer fluoride-free products. However, it is difficult to find dental products from the major companies that do not contain fluoride. I was using Toms of Main products for a while, but the fluoride-free versions became hard to find and they recently started making smaller sizes but charging the same amount. It got to be quite expensive. Therefore, I started using the Crest Pro-Health mouthwash. I like the fact that it is alcohol-free and was pretty happy with it. I hadn't used the toothpaste before, but I do like it okay enough to finish the tube. The taste is nice. The toothbrush provided in this kit is much too big for my liking. I gag very easily, and this toothbrush gave me \"issues\". The floss works nicely (as most do). It worked smoothly and there were no issues with breaking. I probably won't get this kit again, because I can't use the large toothbrush, the floss is good but so are other brands, the toothpaste is okay but would prefer products with ingredients that don't \"stain teeth\" (as cited on packaging). I will either purchase the mouthwash or maybe go back to a fluoride-free formula."
3.00,"My breath did feel fresh for a long time after I used the mouthwash. It had a clean, fresh taste to it. However, it is way to expensive for me to use on a regular basis."
5.00,"It left your mouth feeling clean and your breath smelling good."
5.00,"My 14 year old son recently got his braces off and his orthodontist recommended any of the Crest pro health family of toothpastes for him. I was skeptical that a toothpaste would help his swollen gums, but it really worked! After using the toothpaste for about two weeks, we noticed how much brighter his smile was, and how much better his gums seemed. I really recommend this product."
1.00,"I used Crest ProHealth Enamel Shield for one day before I started having major mouth pain and redness. My tongue, under my tongue, my gums and inside my lips are all red and have white sores. Many people have posted similar problems. Do not buy this product."
4.00,"The flavor was good though, and it did do the job."
1.00,"I only used the mouthrinse...for 3 days. Its destroyed my mouth...stripped my gums,cheeks and tongue. The thick white gooze that appeared after I used it(thought it was plaque)turned out to be damage to the mucous membrane in my mouth. All of my parotid glands are inflamed as r my lypmh nodes...I cant eat b/c my glands are so inflamed  eating and salivating causes more swelling.Dont use it!"
1.00,"Oh god, reading this was a terrible relief!! After three months of using this, I also was chalking up the sore throat and congestion to maybe some seasonal allergies I didn't know about. Then, my perfectly white straight teeth started changing. First, they started yellowing very quickly (full disclosure, I smoke and drink a couple of cups of coffee a day - but I'd been doing that for YEARS without this issue). My gums also began to recede and I got that horrible white film (which I would just think was dehydration or something because it was accompanied by a viciously dry mouth). The film was terrible because my mouth never really felt CLEAN, because it would coat my teeth and make them feel sticky, like I had some bad plaque buildup. Then my teeth actually started to hurt in a weird achy way and felt like the gumline was super irritated, although there wasn't any bleeding. (So, I guess this might be okay if you ahve gingivits ... although I doubt it). All this was new, but I kept attributing it to other things - stress, hormones, bad diet ... who knows.Then, I have two teeth suddenly moving like falling back into my mouth! I had braces almost 21 years ago, and my teeth hadn't budged since, and certainly not with the movement like this. In only a couple of weeks two of them were almost completely behind the teeth next to them and felt sore and loose. At about the same time, I began having these horrible drooling issues - like for no reason, just pools of saliva. I googled the symptoms and thought I had TMJ (yeah, awesome), but no docs could confirm this, although my dentist definitely confirmed everything else. My dentist had to put me in Essex retainers, which are uncomfortable and awkward, especially since I have to spend the day talking to people and am self-conscious of sounding like I have something in my mouth all the time. Not mention the whole thing was expensive because the retainers were \"cosmetic,\" so not covered by insurance. He said that it would be a while before they are back to normal.I honestly hadn't linked this to the toothpaste until the burning started again this evening after I brushed my teeth. Thanks to everyone who has experienced this for writing their reviews (and to everyone else on the internet who spoke up and helped the lightbulb finally go off.) I literally just threw my almost empty tube in the trash. The store had run out of Colgate Total the day I bought this crap. Several people from the internet had said the issue is with the tannin flouride this product has as its main ingredient - which is known to discolor teeth - and some other ingredients that were like harsh chemical detergents. When I pick up ether my old brand or a new one, I will definitely be checking the label first!"
5.00,"I really liked this toothpaste! It left my mouth feeling very clean and fresh!"
3.00,"The crest white mouthwash was the only good product out of this. I think that crest is a good brand. However, the mouthwash is the best."
4.00,"I've been using this toothpaste twice a day for 1 week, and unlike some other reviewers I've had no problems with it so far - no dry mouth, no peeling, nothing negative. I like the consistency and the strong mint taste. I'm hoping it will help my gums which have some chronic issues due to my dental work - I'll post another review in 3 weeks after I see how it does."
4.00,"I loved the crisp and clean feeling in my mouth and the smooth teeth I had after using the toothpaste,"
4.00,"This product worked fine however I did not like the taste."
5.00,"Had a very nice taste. My mouth felt clean & refreshed. Will continue to buy this for my family."
5.00,"This product fights plaque , freshens breath and whitens teeth...I love it. I love the fresh clean taste."
4.00,"I was very pleased with the way the mouthwash made my mouth feel. It felt fresh even after drinking coffee! highly recommend."
5.00,"Yes, I loved the sample I received and my mouth felt very clean and fresh, for quite some time after brushing too. I plan to purchase asap!"
4.00,"I tried Crest Pro Health plaque control toohpaste. I really liked the taste and after a week of using twice a day I could really see a healthy difference in my teeth. It also reduced the plaque build up."
1.00,"If I could give zero stars I would. Being highly protective of my uninsured teeth, I tried my best to keep them healthy. So imagine my surprise when, despite flossing and brushing and mouthwashing like only a dentist would I saw my teeth turning brown... My FRONT TEETH! Whaaaaaat!? I asked. Now normally I used ACT to rebuild enamel but the store near me was out so I bought a bottle of this demon juice. I regret this immensely. I thought maybe the burning tongue and dying tastebuds meant it was working. But in reality it means you've made a huge mistake. Do not use. Do not buy. Awful, awful product."
5.00,"nice, not overpowering mint. left my mouth feeling clean for hours after brushing."
5.00,"You must try Crest Pro-Health toothpaste! It has the best clean feeling I have ever experienced! Leaves your mouth tingling clean and keeps your breath fresh. Teeth are literally squeaky clean for hours!!!"
4.00,"I really liked this toothpaste. It leaves my teeth feeling unbelievably clean. I've been using Crest for the majority of my life and have had almost zero cavities."
4.00,"loved it because it didn't leave an alchohol tasts"
5.00,"Worked great the first time I used it! Will buy again!"
4.00,"Left my teeth feeling clean and my mouth feeling fresh!"
4.00,"Anyone???"
5.00,"I actually used all the products. The Oral-B Brush, Crest Toothpaste, Glide Floss and Prohealth Clinical Rinse. I use all 4 products twice a day morning and night and brush my teeth as I want to several times in between. I do this as a matter of routine. I do prefer these products as they leave my whole mouth feeling fresh and clean."
4.00,"Using this toothpaste makes my mouth feel \"just brushed\" for hours. Very unique!"
5.00,"I really like the crest Pro clinical mouthwash. The flavor and the strength were perfect. Pleasant but ineffective. The price was a little higher than I usually spend for mouthwash. But, it left my mouth feeling like I had just been to the dentist's office."
5.00,"I like that there is no alcohol in it and it does a good job, prettty much as good as going to the dentist."
5.00,"This toothpaste is everything I expect from Crest. The flavor is not overpowering and no matter the quantity used the toothpaste does a great job of cleaning my teeth and making my mouth feel and smell clean for a long time."
4.00,"This is a top of the line in oral health care. Try it, you will love it. Walt"
5.00,"I have always used Crest products, but I absolutely fell in love with Crest Plague toothpaste! My mouth feel amazing after brushing. It's fresh and clean. And using the Crest Clinical mouth wash after just makes my mouth all the more cleaner! AMAZING!"
5.00,"I used the product and had a dentist appointment several weeks later and the person that cleaned my teeth commented that my teeth had less tartar and plaque. So I guess it worked!!!"
5.00,"I just love how Crest reinvents itself and keeps the brand relative to the times. I grew up with Crest as one of the leading brands of toothpaste. It has remained at the top and I will continue to use it. It is very invigorating with a fresh, clean, minty flavor. I think that gum protection comes from regular and proper brushing...as well as regular dental checkups. I do not know if this brand can really protect gums...but I do know that it cleans to my level of satisfaction."
1.00,"Never buy this product. This \"Crest Pro-health Multi-Protection Mouth Rinse\" caused brown stains on my lower teeth just after 3 weeks of using. I was wondering what could be the reason of the brown strain; later discovered the bitter fact from the reviews of this product."
5.00,"In the past I have shied away from some mouthwashes that claimed to kill plaque & help your teeth and mouth because of the nasty taste and the burning sensation. This Crest Pro-Health Clinical Rinse is in a different class altogether. The taste is pleasant and while, there's enough of a tingle to let you know it's working, it's actually a good experience. It doesn't foam up in my mouth like some products. In short, this stuff had none of the features I disliked in other brands and everything about it is good. No complaints. Pleasantly surprised!"
4.00,"I consider myself to be quite particular about my oral health care. After trying the New Pro-Health Clinical products from Crest® and Oral-B, I was pleasantly surprised how the products have reduced the normal levels of tartar after just 2 weeks of using. I normally have tartar build up on the lower front and these products reduced it by at least 50%! Way to go Crest and Oral-B. You have got a new loyal customer for this product line!"
5.00,"finally a mouthwash that doesnt burn your mouth. love it."
5.00,"I used this product and was totally won over by the overall effectiveness of it. I have been looking for a toothpaste that has all the important components and I have found it. Would totally recommend this product."
5.00,"I just used the toothpaste and with it alone my teeth felt cleaner all day. Also, the taste was good not gritty like other tooothpaste."
5.00,"Since trying Crest Pro Health Clinical Plaque Control Toothpaste, I now using no other brand! I want to keep my teeth and gums in the very best of shape and this toothpaste seems to be superior to all others I have ever tried. My teeth feel so clean and my breath is so fresh, I feel like I have just been to the dentist for a regular cleaning!"
5.00,"Love the taste and how it leaves my breath. It makes my mouth feel fresh. This is the only one I will buy now."
5.00,"I was very satisfied with the Crest and Oral B products! My teeth feel cleaner, my gums feel healthier. I am very satisfied!"
5.00,"As you would expect from a toothpaste that targets an older customer, this toothpaste is mild and easy on the teeth and gums. There seems to be a gentle warming sensation with this toothpaste that helps moderate tooth and gum sensitivities. And \"mild\" is the operative word as the mint flavor is not \"loud\" and overbearing, but, actually, mild and roughly half the flavor strength of other products. There is also some modest grittiness to this toothpaste, which would seem to help get teeth whiter and stay whiter. After ten days of use, I found the latter to be more of my situation. I did not seem any direct \"white\" improvement, but for me, more importantly, I did not see any new coffee or wine stains. The mild abrasiveness in the toothpaste seems to stop new stains from forming."
4.00,"This tooth paste really made my teeth feel clean and smooth. The taste was really great too! I highly recommend it!"
5.00,"This is a great product it does the job and keeps on working. I will buy it again."
5.00,"I can't seem to find it anywhere anymore, and I fear it might be at the end of production. But it's a great toothpaste with a great taste and seemingly a touch grittier than most, which polishes up your teeth nicely. The dentist has inquired what I'm doing differently because my plaque formation is down. Bring it back! It's good stuff!"
4.00,"I have tried the toothpaste. It is good, my teeth felt clean, but other than that I didn't feel it did anything special or different that other toothpastes that I have used before."
4.00,"Great mouthwash. Makes teeth look cleaner and feel cleaner. Don't get as much plaque buildup as once did."
5.00,"I buy Crest toothpaste 100% of the time. Sometimes they get a little wacky with the flavors, but this one is a nice, generic mint. I don't have serious gum issues, but they are on the sensitive side. For the most part, I think toothpaste is toothpaste. I have no complaints about this product. The taste is fine, and while I'm not sure it helped my gums, it certainly didn't make them any worse."
3.00,"This is Crest toothpaste, supposedly with some special benefits. It's good toothpaste, but I haven't felt the \"benefit\" yet, I have sensitive teeth, and this toothpaste hasn't helped that feeling (one of the benefits offered by this toothpaste). (and yes, I see the dentist twice a year etc...)"
5.00,"I bought the Crest Pro-Health for my daughter (the plaque control). She is very picky about the \"taste\" of a toothpaste, I was surprised that she did not complain. I will buy this again."
5.00,"I have loved and used Crest Nighttime toothpaste for years. When every store but Wall Mart stopped stocking it, I got worried. I would buy 6 tubes at s time. Then the time came an d they stopped. Hooray for these folks who bought up the rest. I hope they have a lot. I'm still buying in bulk."
5.00,"I LOVE this toothpaste. It had my teeth feeling clean for hours! Keep up the good work!"
5.00,"I loved this toothpaste. It was a great clean feeling."
3.00,"I tried this sample I received and I really likes it. It makes your mouth feel really clean and leaves your teeth feeling smooth."
3.00,"I tried this new toothpaste this morning. I felt like I was brushing my teeth with a Breathsaver. It had a really great taste, but was a little over powering. The feel was a little gritty too. I did like the way my mouth felt very clean afterwards though."
5.00,"what a great product!! really made my mouth feel clean"
5.00,"Loved the way my mouth felt after using this, and the feeling lasts a long time. This is now a staple product in our home."
5.00,"This is great floss, its durable, smells great and is smooth between your teeth! I have used many flosses that come apart between your teeth and then you need more floss to get the floss out! This is a great durable brand and i highly recommend it."
4.00,"I liked this product how it worked but i noticed when i gargled with it you could definatly taste the peroxide after. not a great taste but product was nice other wise."
4.00,"Hi.. This product is a good mouth wash. It isn't very \"harsh\" tasting. I can use this twice a day with no side effects. I do recommend to rinse mouth out with water (after brushing teeth) before using the product. If you don't, you may get bits of mouth wash clumps in your mouth. Not sure why... also, when you spit, make sure that the water is on. This is because the mouth wash can stain the inside of your sink. Well, its really not a stain..but it can mark your sink puple... to avoid this, run the water while spitting."
4.00,"My teeth feel very clean after using this toothpaste. The reason I only gave 4 stars was that the flavor was not my favorite. It feels like it is working as soon as you put it on. I will purchase again - and maybe more flavors will come out."
5.00,"My entire family uses and loves this and will not let me by any other."
5.00,"I love my Crest Night Tooth Paste - It really helps make your morning breath fresher! I suffer with lactose intolerance issues stemming from Crohn's Disease, with that - you can wake up with horrible breath. Believe me - I have, but not any more - Thanks to this wonderful product! I haven't been able to find Crest Night at my local stores, so I made a search on-line and was grateful to find it - Thank you amazon.com!"
1.00,"I started noticing brown stains on my front teeth. they are large stains as well. i will stop using this product."
5.00,"Not much one can say about toothpaste. Crest Pro-Health has a pleasant taste and seems to leave the teeth clean. Amazon was its typical well-priced, easy-ordering, fast-delivering self. Ordered Oct 17th, Free Shipped Oct 18th, Received in Louisiana Oct 20rh. Crest Pro-Health Whitening Toothpaste, 4.2-Ounce Carton (Pack of 6)"
4.00,"I have used Crest Pro Health for a couple of years now.I have been happy with the results I have had with it.I think that they improved an already exceptional product!"
5.00,"I loved this toothpaste i have always used crest growing up and now thats all we use and i would definitly buy this toothpaste on a regular basis."
5.00,"I loved this line of products. They kept my teeth clean feeling all day long. I have been having scaling treatments done at the dentists for several months now and the last time he replied that he remembered the build-up being worse. I would have laughed if he didn't have sharp instruments in my mouth at the time."
4.00,"I would use this all the time. My teeth felt like I just had them cleaned at the dentist. Leaves a great fresh taste behind."
5.00,"I've been using pro health with my sonicare for the last 10 yrs and have never had a tooth problem. Once I started using pro health and sonicare together my teeth and gums actually got healthier."
4.00,"I've been using this product off and on for a couple of years. I go back and forth between natural toothpastes that don't contain fluoride, and commercial products that do. I hadn't used the Crest Pro Health Whitening for several months, so I thought it was time to give it another try. It feels as if there are little gritty beads that assist in cleaning the surface of the teeth. I must say that after just one brushing my teeth felt super clean and smooth. And as an added bonus, it had a good flavor. I haven't noticed any dramatic whitening, but I imagine it takes more consistent use for noticeable results. All in all, I like it and would buy it again."
4.00,"Leave your teeth and mouth feeling clean. Also left your teeth looking alot cleaner and whiter."
1.00,"I used this toothpaste for 5 days and noticed that my gums felt like they were burning. I wasn't sure what was causing it. It made me very uncomfortable and made me want to drink cold water all day long to cool my mouth. I looked on the internet to see if it might be the toothpaste. A lot of people had complaned so I stopped using it right away and kept drinking a lot of water to see if it would help. One day later and I'm already feeling better. I'm going to throw it away and tell my friends to never use this product. I think Proctor & Gamble should take it off the market."
5.00,"impressed is not enough of a word. i could not believe that 12 hours AFTER brushing and lots of eating my teeth were still as \"slick\" and had that freshly brushed feeling. had i not tried this myself i never would have believed it could do this."
5.00,"This is great deal to buy. and packaged to help you get pro health teeth cleaning and maintenance. I am using it everyday and promote the use of flossing and using these packaged crest products of teeth maintenance. feeling great everyday. breath fresh each time I brush. flossing helps keep disease away from mouth. and enjoy kissing my wife."
3.00,"There are so many varieties of toothpaste out there, we're all picky. Here are my reasons for being so. Things I like: - Crest brand. - Minty taste. Pretty standard. - Defends against inflamed gums, which is usually an issue for me. Things I don't like: - The paste doesn't \"lather\" while brushing. It's like I'm pushing around a gel in my mouth, so the \"smoother formulation\" is true as advertised. I didn't know what I was getting into. - The 50+ label. I understand what Crest is doing, but there's a chance folks under 50 might be deterred from buying."
1.00,"As others have said, this toothpaste really tears your mouth apart. Not only does is have a slightly off taste, it does a number on your mouth and lips. I too have experienced the thick filmy white stuff coming off of the inside of my mouth - it's disgusting to pull out. I've also experienced a lot of burning of my lips while I brush and I've noticed that they are very chapped. I have, as of today, discontinued use of this terrible product. I don't care if it's good for my teeth - loosing the lining of my mouth is NOT worth it!"
2.00,"I have only used this crest product twice recently (once at night, and once the morning after) and at first I didn't notice anything strange since I had eaten a very bland cereal so it wasn't really supposed to taste like anything , but then later as I got the munchies for a snack, I reached for some nutella. At first I thought there was something wrong with the nutella because I could barely taste anything so I asked my brother to give his opinion and he thought it was fine and as delicious as ever. I was a little confused but I didn't really think much of the incident until I went to go buy some chili cheese fries. That's when I realized that I could barely taste anything. It was like if the taste buds in the front of my tongue were gone. I could only taste with the back of my tongue. That just made my food very unpleasant. Also, everything did taste a little metallic. So I get home and decide to do a little research and google \"loss of taste\" and well the first things that show up on google are some very serious diseases and illnesses like Alzheimer's and so I actually begin to get scared because I'm only 17! But then I come across a website full of  crest pro health rinse complaints. And I begin to read what everyone has to say and that's when I realized that it was the mouthwash that did this to me. I am glad to have come accross the website , if not I would've been worried out of my mind and thought it mEant I had alzheimeirs. I hope I get my taste back soon as other users have. The only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of one is because my family used it too and nothing happened to them. Also, I had used this mouthwash once before around 3 years ago and nothing happened to me then but I recently developed some allergies so maybe it's that?"
5.00,"I was pleasantly surprised by this toothpaste. I generally stick to the same stuff every time I buy toothpaste, so I wasn't sure about trying something new. However, it made my mouth feel clean, left a great taste, and was long lasting freshness!"
5.00,"i loved the taste and the texture. It gets the job done and not too bad of a price either."
2.00,"The first thing I noticed when first using this product was that there was something in the paste, kind of like exfoliates in face cream. I am not sure if this is as good idea for your teeth as it is for your skin (that is a question for your doctor) but I do find it a bit strange. The next thing I noticed was the taste, it taste like old timey toothpaste that did not really have any flavor, it just tasted just like, well, paste. This has a small hint of mint and it does linger for a while leaving almost a burning sensation to my lips. On the plus side it does claims to fight cavities, harmful plaque, tarter, bad breath, while helping to reverse gingivitis, builds increasing protection against painful sensitivity (I am very sensitive to cold water in certain areas but did not notice any difference after a week of use), and whitens teeth. After I am done with this tube, I will probably try a different product that does all those things but tastes better and does not have any flakes in it."
4.00,"I thought the toothpaste worked great. My teeth felt great and were really clean. Left a pleasant feeling in my mouth!"
4.00,"After using the toothpaste, it feels smooth and leaves no aftertaste."
5.00,"This is an excellent toothpaste. Not only did it taste great, but it left my mouth feeling clean."
5.00,"I have fallen in love with Crest Clinical Pro-Health. You can actually feel a better clean in your entire mouth! I don't want to use anything else anymore."
4.00,"After trying this product I do think it keeps my teeth feeling cleaner. I also like the taste of the toothpaste."
4.00,"My husband and I liked this toothpaste. It really feels like it works. a little strong in taste."
5.00,"This toothpaste is great - a brand I REALLY trust, fresh taste and good for sensitive teeth. Love the product and will continue to recommend the whole line!"
5.00,"My husband has gingivitis and has to go to the dentist every 3 months. After using Crest Pro Health toothpaste for a couple of months the dentist noticed a big improvement."
4.00,"Easy, pleasant and effective way to add to oral health routine. Time will tell how the long term results, but certainly can't hurt."
4.00,"I really liked this product because it has a pleasant taste and does everything you need it to do with out the strong alcohol taste and burning feeling! I would and have recommended!"
4.00,"I really like the way this product left my mouth feeling fresh and clean all day long!"
5.00,"you could write a really dirty review about how frothy it gets and how it coats your tongue, makes it tingly and has a little grit in it that nicely polishes your pearly whites....toothpaste is sexy."
5.00,"I love crest and this product just made me love them even more!! Honestly makes your teeth feel a lot cleaner than a regular toothpaste and it has a lot more benefits using this product. Go get some!!!"
4.00,"Not bad...left my mouth feeling clean but it definetly had an odd aftertaste."
5.00,"Great, clean feeling after brushing. The feel lasts a really long time. The taste is not overpowering, just gives the sense that it continues to work and protect. I particularly like this line of Crest products as an added way to help maintain our dental health."
4.00,"I like the taste and freshness of the mouthwash. It wasn't alcohol-y and my breath seemed to stay fresh a long time."
4.00,"My teeth definitely felt cleaner for longer, and I enjoyed really fresh breath after using this product. Great for a day of meetings!"
5.00,"This is our new \"go to \" toothpaste. We have a great fresh and clean feeling."
1.00,"I used this stuff this morning for about the third or fourth time. I started using over this past weekend with no problems. Today I swished for the same amount of time I always do and everything seemed fine. I skipped breakfast because I was running late and for lunch I stopped by my favorite Thai restaurant and ordered my favorite meal to go. I still didn't know what had happened. I drank a tea on the drive home and noticed that it didn't really taste the same. In fact, it didn't taste like anything. I blew my nose, thinking maybe it was stuffy and I miraculously couldn't tell. Didn't work so I stopped drinking it. When I got home, I began stuffing my face with my lunch and immediately stopped. Why? BECAUSE MY MOUTH WAS ON FIRE!! It wasn't until a few moments later that I realized that I hadn't tasted any of the food I'd just swallowed. Plus, it's never been spicy enough to cause a reaction like that. I drank some water and tried again, same thing. I can't taste anything! I put two and two together and the only thing that could have caused this is the mouth wash. It's the only thing in my regimen that has changed recently. Lo and behold, I find that I'm far from the only person to experience this side effect. It sucks that Crest doesn't have the integrity to pull this stuff off of the market. It sucks even worse that I can't even eat my Prik King chicken unless I want to torture myself. Shame on you, Crest!"
5.00,"Loved the fresh clean taste, not to \"stiff\" and created a great foam. Left my teeth feeling clean and mouth fresh."
5.00,"My teeth stayed fresh for a long time after brushing with this product."
4.00,"Fresh, Wonderful and Clean. Now that's how a mouth should feel!"
5.00,"Loved the long lasting clean feeling. Taste was alright for toothpaste, but the cleaning power was great. I would buy this again!"
5.00,"made my teeth feel extra clean!!!! This products made me want to brush my tooth even more than I already do!"
5.00,"This product is awesome. It makes my mouth smell great and I can also feel the difference. My teeth are smooth and white!"
5.00,"Try it, you'll love it ,my teeth looks and feels alot cleaner. a all day good feeling."
3.00,"I think that this is a good toothpaste, but it is very expensive. I like it but would probably choose something less expensive next time."
1.00,"By no means am I saying this product is the ABSOULTE sole reason why my gums have begun to recede. However the below evidence leads me to think otherwise...                                                                     To begin, I've been an adamant dentist visitor my whole life. I go, each year, twice to the dentist office (6 month cleanings as recommended by dentists) and on each visit I've rarely had complaints made to me by the dentist. Never have I had a cavity. Never have I had dental work done (except for wisdom teeth). Yadda yadda yadda.                                                                     This past year - I decided to switch the toothpaste i have traditionally used and started using this product (....note.... Victim of superb marketing by Crest)                                                                     At my most recent dentist appointment this past week, my dentist told me he noticed that my gums have started to recede. He said that he has never seen it in a person of my age.                                                                     Given the circumstances... My conclusion is that this product is the cause of the problem. IN ADDITION, I'm strongly considering legal action against this company."
4.00,"I love the taste. I typically don't like pastes (I prefer gels) but this one isn't too strong. Plus the frest mint taste lasts a long time. I use it after lunch at work as well!"
4.00,"I really liked who fresh my whole mouth felt after using crest pro-health. Although a little pricey, it definitely leaves you with a fresh clean feeling all day."
1.00,"WARNING: I used this product for 4 days, 2 times a day. Today my tongue is completely numb and I cannot taste ANYTHING. I can't detect hot or cold either. I can't feel burning hot coffee or ice cubes, and I can't taste the soup I'm eating (which I almost burnt myself with, but didn't know until I swallowed how hot it was). My roommates are having the EXACT same reaction. After doing research I discovered we weren't alone. How has this product not be recalled yet?"
4.00,"The toothpaste cleans your teeth great and gives you lasting fresh breath!"
5.00,"Crest is always a good company that delivers what it claims to do.Buying it at a good price always helps."
5.00,"Using Crest ProHealth rinse makes me feel like my teeth are really clean!"
1.00,"Started using this because it boasted alcohol-free. After a few weeks I was noticing brown stains on my teeth and couldn't figure out what was going on. I didn't even get stains like this when I was drinking coffee daily. Then I read the fine print on the bottle and it said right there may cause staining of teeth, what the eff, that's the exact opposite result I want in a mouthwash. Quit using and fortunately an expensive dental cleansing visit got the stains off. Crest your products are supposed to clean teeth, not make more work for the dentist. Don't use this stuff!"
5.00,"my 7 year old loves this toothpaste because it's not 'baby' toothpaste and it doesn't 'burn' like adult toothpaste. it's a great toothpaste!"
1.00,"Nevermore!! :("
3.00,"The crest Pro health Multi protection rinse tastes great and also I like it because it doesn't burn. The only thing I didn't like about it is it doesnt leave my mouth feeling fresh longer like the alcohol based mouthwash I used before buying this one.sometimes I feel I haven't rinsed my mouth at all."
5.00,"I've been using this rinse for about two weeks now and my mouth definitely feels fresh and clean. Results seem to last a long time too!"
5.00,"I have been using Crest for many years. I have tried others and always came back to crest. It leaves my mouth feeling fresh."
5.00,"I love this production and this is my favorite!!!!"
4.00,"I found this crest toothpaste to give me a clean and fresh feeling when using it."
5.00,"Great toothpaste. Leaves your teeth feeling very clean and your mouth feels fresh long after brushing."
1.00,"I wish I could upload pictures of my tongue after three days of use. I didn't even get a warning that my tongue was going to explode in to painful chemical burns. I just woke up one morning and couldn't eat, sleep or move my tongue. It has been three days of this and still no relief. Of course I quit using it after I woke up to a swollen extremely painfully burned tongue. Nothing helps this. Not cold, CERTAINLY not anything salty, nothing but water and even with that it hurts extremely bad to move. My stomach acid is tearing my stomach apart because I can't eat. There are no warnings that this could happen. My husband had a similar, less severe reaction but didn't put it together until it happened to me. DON'T USE THIS PRODUCT!!!!! YOU WILL GET CHEMICAL BURNS!!!!!"
5.00,"Have always used crest as a child into my adults years. I have always enjoyed the fresh clean feeling that it left my mouth feeling. I would recommend this and any other crest product to anyone! I feel crest does a good job!"
5.00,"The mouthwash wasn't too harsh. It left my mouth and teeth feeling really clean."
5.00,"i really love the clean feeling it leaves your teeth feeling."
4.00,"I liked the way this toothpaste made my mouth feel clean and fresh. I wasn't too crazy about the taste but it definitely did the job."
4.00,"I really enjoyed the feeling this toothpaste left in my mouth and on my teeth it not only cleaned really well, but also tastes great! Very good product I highly recommend!"
5.00,"After I use the toothpaste my teeth feel almost like I have been to the dentist!. My teeth feel so squeeky clean it is amazing. With other toothpastes, you know you know you have brushed them. With this Crest product, everyone else will know it too!"
4.00,"Liked the product, seemed to work well. Fresh and clean feeling and after each use my smile seemed a bit brighter and whiter! Can't beat that!!"
4.00,"I have been using the various colors (blue, green) of Crest Pro-Health and each time I visit the hygenist, she told me my teeth were stained and most likely from using the product in those colors. She said that I need to use a clear product. This one is \"clear.\" It also has a more bland taste than the other colors, closer to a peroxide or Kaopectate taste. I am not crazy with the taste but since the product is excellent for reducing plaque and killing \"morning breath,\" I use it every morning when I wake up.I like this product a lot more than Listerine (too strong and almost impossible to gargle) and Scope (virtually no dental benefit). I withheld giving it a full five stars because I think the colored versions of the product taste better."
5.00,"I love this thing. It makes my mouth feels so fresh and clean it almost feels like i came out of my dentist office. love it!"
4.00,"Makes your teeth feel and look so clean. We only use Crest and will continue to only use Crest."
5.00,"I would buy this again! If left my teeth clean and my breath fresh!!"
5.00,"I have been using Listerine for years (the green mint flavor that burns like fire!) and assumed I had been using the best stuff on the shelf. My boyfriend turned me on to the Crest mouthwash and I have to admit, I'm glad I took his advice. This stuff is leagues ahead of Listerine. The flavor (and burn) is not nearly as intense, but don't let this fool you-- the Crest mouthwash will keep your mouth feeling fresh and your breath minty for hours compared to Listerine. I also noticed that my gums were much healthier than they've ever been and I can now use a heavier toothbrush without causing irritation. I switch back and forth between using this and the Crest Whitening Mouthwash, which contains peroxide. Between the two, I couldn't be happier. My teeth are whiter, my gums are healthy and my breath is fresh-- without the horrible stinging and burning of Listerine. I'm definitely a convert. Highly Recommended!"
5.00,"I was a loyal to a competing brand until I tried the new Crest ProHealth toothpaste. I love how my teeth feel and really like that some of the pain and sensitivity I was feeling before has gone away. I think this will be a permanent switch!"
3.00,"We have been using Crest's Pro-Health line for several years (we usually buy the mint-flavored whitening version) and Amazon provided us with a sample tube of this variation to try. On the plus side: + it has a pleasant light mint flavor...mildly sweet, with almost a bee-pollen-like taste...we liked it + it flows easily from the tube and applies well to the toothbrush + it foams nicely when brushing and leaves the teeth & mouth feeling clean On the minus side: - this version, as do several others of the Pro-Health line that we have experienced, contains silica, which we feel is very abrasive and probably should be used on a limited basis (we alternate the Pro-Health with less-abrasive toothpastes)...and the grittiness is not pleasant (it feels like sand on the teeth when one bites down. This is the biggest disadvantage, in our opinion. - we feel that Crest has gone overboard on the variety of Pro-Health versions...and have made it very confusing for customers: 3 or 4 different ones would make more sense. - the multiple claims of what it accomplishes are not easily verifiable, and, in fact, difficult to fully believe, given the seemingly conflicting features (eg, it supposedly whitens, and polishes the teeth with silica, yet also claims to strengthen enamel?)...we realize this is standard for most similarly conventional dental-care products, but it's still not a good feature Crest has a very informative FAQ at crestprohealth.com/pro-health-faq (hopefully Amazon will allow this link, since it is a very helpful resource) for people wanting more specifics. Thanks for reading!"
5.00,"The Crest Pro-Health Clinical Plaque Control toothpaste really gets my teeth nice and clean. I can tell by how they feel that they're staying clean longer through the day too. I'm definitely a fan!"
4.00,"I really enjoyed the mint flavor of this product. The consistency of the toothpaste was not to gritty and was rather enjoyable."
4.00,"The crest pro health mouthwash left my breath feeling clean and fresh all morning. When I used it before bed, I noticed that I didn't suffer from horrendous morning breath the next day. Love it!"
5.00,"I love the way my teeth squeak (giggle) after I use this product. Makes me feel clean, fresh and good about the products I use ! Aaaaawwsome !"
4.00,"Really liked this product. It left my mouth feeling fresh a lot longer than other products, plus it contained health benefits. So, I was not only getting cleaner breath but a healthier mouth"
5.00,"I like that this toothpaste has not only whitening abilities but it also has ingredients for sensitive teeth. It foams up real nicely while brushing and quite frankly I love this stuff!"
3.00,"This is a duplicate review as amazonvine apparently has no record of the first review. It is a cut and paste of the first review.3.0 out of 5 stars Crest Pro Health - Use With Caution, January 31, 2013This review is from: Crest Pro-Health Whitening Fresh Clean Mint Toothpaste 6 Oz (Pack of 4) (Health and Beauty)After reading some of the reviews on this product I asked my dentist if the product caused staining of the teeth. She said it does in some people and that her office no longer gives out samples of the toothpaste or the mouth rinse. It is not possible to know which people will be affected by the stannous floride in this product: she can use it but her sister has the staining issue which while not permanent can be annoying. One would wonder why Crest hasn't changed the formula of this toothpaste. I have used Crest products for years but would not recommend this one."
2.00,"(if possible).  This mouthwash is my least favorite of all time.  I can't figure out what it does versus a traditional mouthwash.  Alcohol free is good and bad...good because it doesn't burn, bad because you don't have a good aftertaste or refreshing feeling after using it.                                                                     It's pointless to use an alcohol free mw if the active ingredient actually makes your teeth hurt (it does to me).  If you're worried about alcohol you should try something like biotene which is excellent but you need a second mortgage on your house to buy it.  Personally, I just use low alcohol mouthwash like the generic scope you could try using a flouride rinse but again...expensive.                                                                     The crest brand has some good products...the pro health line is not one of them."
5.00,"I just bought the Crest Pro clinic Toothpaste last weekend. I been using it for the last couple days, my mouth feels refresh but my teeth feels refresher. I like the feeling of running my tongue against my teeth. It feels almost like I just left the dentist after a clean. I like how I didnt' have to squeeze more toothpaste out to keep brushing my teeth to get it that feeling of clean and healthy. I just wished the toothpaste wasn't so pricey. Thank goodness for coupons!!!"
1.00,"After using this product for only one week, the inside of my mouth has sores and my tongue feels like it has been burnt on hot soup. I thought I had an infection in my mouth. After reading about this product online, I realize it is the crest pro health products. My dentist recommended these products. I am discontinuing use of these products immediately and hope the pain and irritation subside."
5.00,"The crest toothbrush is the best toothbrush around. It has nice soft bristles to clean my pearly whites. No more gum irritation and bleeding. I love it!!"
3.00,"However, I do not like the packaging and am considering discontinued use for that reason. The toothpaste continues to ooze out after use, even though the cap is on. Toothpaste leaks into the cap and leaks onto the shelf and also onto the outside of the tube. Since I first had a problem with this, I have paid attention to closing the cap properly but still have the problem. It's messy. Please consider putting this wonderful toothpaste into a tube with a regular screw-on cap. Thank you."
4.00,"After using it for a month now, I can say it's pretty good and for the price, it's darn great!"
1.00,"I used this product for the first time last night and I woke up feeling like I had burned my tongue on hot food. Eating breakfast and lunch today I noticed I could still taste my food but not as well and my tongue still feels raw and burned. After looking up the rest of the reviews I'm going home and dumping the entire bottle and never using again as I value my sense of taste. I've been using Pro Health toothpaste and I'm dumping THAT too for good measure. Ugh!!!!"
5.00,"I have had many issues with fighting plaque,especially since I have been taking so many prescription medications for thyroid replacement and high blood pressure. Using the Crest Pro Health Plaque Control has lessened the amount of plaque I normally have! I really encourage anyone with plaque issues to try this product."
5.00,"Very good product"
4.00,"This product leaves your mouth feeling fresh and clean."
5.00,"The toothpaste leaves a clean feeling in your mouth."
4.00,"Crest® Pro-Health Clinical Plaque Control Toothpaste is wonderful! I love having teeth that feel clean when I brush them. I just had my dentist visit and this is the first toothpaste I have used since my cleaning and my teeth still look great."
4.00,"I usually don't like rinses much because they either taste too overwhelming or they leave my mouth feeling icky. This product actually was pleasant tasting and I felt that I was doing something good for my mouth by using it."
5.00,"I love this product, my mouth feel so clean and healthy after use, that it is now my #1 rinse."
5.00,"I used the Crest toothpaste and it is excellent. I love the way my mouth feels after I use it and it brightens my teeth, leaving me with a great smile."
5.00,"Wow, all the Crest Pro-Health products are awesome! They get you teeth super clean like a Dentist cleaning will."
1.00,"I rarely write a review but this morning's brush requires it. In an attempt to save money, i've not replaced this toothpaste, but it has no redeeming factors. Mint flavor? I prefer the taste of morning breath than the way this toothpaste leaves my mouth tasting. Whitening? I don't notice a difference despite my diligence with the product. Overall dissatisfied. Perhaps my teeth are cleaner. But taste and the ability to whiten are promised and not fulfilled. I think it's time to replace this finally. Unfortunate because I still have a brand new tube to run through."
1.00,"I haven't had the same issues as other reviews with staining of my teeth, but that lingering aftertaste is just a bit much to deal with. I didn't think much of it at first, I thought maybe I was just starting to drink two quickly after the recommended 30 minuets. The aftertaste really clashes with certain foods and lasts at least a good 8 hours after rinsing. I would not recommend this product."
5.00,"I really loved this mouth wash. My mouth felt very fresh and clean and the taste was wonderful"
5.00,"compared to my current toothpaste it does better and when i finish my supply i will be converting"
5.00,"I love this new crest line, the fresh mouth feeling and a great taste !"
4.00,"It is a good quality toothpaste that really makes a difference on how clean and smooth it makes your teeth."
5.00,"This Crest Mouthwash left a fresh clean taste in my mouth that lasted most of the day."
5.00,"Crest Pro Health is the best toothpaste, it leaves my mouth feeling brand new and fresh."
5.00,"Love it !!! My teeth feels extemely clean, and lives you with a fresh breath. I highly recomend it."
4.00,"The toothpaste is great on my teeth and gums. Plus I love the fresh minty taste."
5.00,"Nice flavored toothpaste that left my mouth feeling clean!"
5.00,"i love it, make me fell clean all day and fresh i recommend crest 100%"
4.00,"This mouth wash is very minty, but it definitely makes my mouth feel clean and fresh for quite a long time."
4.00,"I bought this for my mother, she uses mouth wash on a daily basis. She had no problems with this, it was not too strong in taste or feel."
4.00,"my gums would sometimes bleed while brushing my teeth and after going to the dentist she advised me to use this product. sure enough after 2 weeks my gums were back to normal, no bleeding, and no pain. only cons is that it sometimes causes a burning sensation while brushing your teeth, and that it has a grittiness to it. this toothpaste might not be for those who have sensitive teeth as it does sometimes cause tingling"
5.00,"This is by far my favorite toothpaste on the market. The twin pack makes it a good value purchase. 2 x 4oz"
1.00,"I had been a loyal user of Crest 3D White for a long time before switching to the Pro Health Sensitive+Enamel Shield. My problems with sensitivity have always been fleeting, but I thought the better toothpaste would serve me better in the long run. It worked fine for a couple of weeks, though I did notice that my mouth often felt unclean. However, in the past three days my gums have become irritated and my mouth has red spots and dryness. This seems to be consistent with other reviews that state that the toothpaste basically strips your mouth of everything. Perhaps this stuff works for some, but I'm going back to 3D White and enjoying my mouth health."
3.00,"i really didn't care for the taste so i can't comment on how well it actually does what it claims, because i stopped using it."
3.00,"I have been brushing with the toothpaste for almost 2 weeks. I like it but would prefer if I had gotten a gel. that's just my preference. I would purchase again."
1.00,"Crest Pro-Health Toothpaste tube -- CAP WILL NOT CLOSE. Result is that toothpaste dribbles out -- the cap won't close even if you wash it off to make sure the leaking paste is not preventing the cap from closing. I viewed the Crest website and saw several other recent comments on this problem but I was unable to get all the way into the comments section to add my own experience. Question: Have all the other Crest tubes been changed to this type cap -- I can't tell from the packaging but I don't want to purchase another tube with this design. LIZA"
4.00,"I like the way my mouth felt after rinsing with the mouth wash. The product seemed a bit pricey so only 4 stars for the value."
5.00,"Great Products! Crest Pro-Health Clinical leaves your mouth fresh and your teeth feeling smooth and extra clean. Great cleaning checkup at the dentist! A little pricey, but great products."
5.00,"Clean teeth and fresh breath while preventing cavities alone product."
5.00,"Tastes great and this rinse has great benefits for those who may require more attention to plaque and gum issues."
5.00,"Well, this toothpaste seems to be very good. I'm not sure why it's marketed for people that are older that 50 years old. People that are younger can definitely use this product. I like the fact that it's 7.8 ounces, which is more than enough. It also has big flat top that allows you to make the toothpaste stand up. I more than likely won't buy this product, because it's market for 50+ crowd and I prefer Crest Complete, but it's a good product."
5.00,"I like the little crunchy particles in it, it's just like the stuff the dentists used to use! That sounds gross but I really like it. It also makes your teeth squeak because they're so clean!"
5.00,"This toothpaste left my mouth feeling clean and fresh. Definitely will buy again!"
1.00,"This stuff is weird. I just started using it (didn't buy on amazon) and found that my sense of taste is WAY off after using it and my tongue feels cold all day. Whats up with that? I guess this is good if you're trying to eat less, as it truly makes everything flavorless."
5.00,"Love all the features it provides and so glad the taste is good. I will use this in the future"
5.00,"My dentist was very pleased with the improvement in my dental health. The Crest Plaque is the best in removing the plaque and keeping my teeth white."
5.00,"Sometimes I am fearful of toothpaste that is 'good' for you--I always find myself not liking the taste or the aftertaste of the paste. But this was not true for Pro-Health with Plaque Control. I felt like it cleaned and left my mouth feeling fresh. I would definitely purchase this Crest again"
5.00,"I use this product daily!! I do rinse several times before leaving the bathroom, but its worth it!!"
5.00,"The name says it all...I expected no less than the excellent quality that I received."
5.00,"I love Crest products in general, but the pro-health toothpaste is truly exceptional. Left my teeth feeling clean."
4.00,"Pretty good toothpaste, but I still prefer Colgate Total."
5.00,"My teeth felt like I just walked out of the dentist"
5.00,"It has a good flavor and it feels like it works really good at keeping your mouth clean and healthy."
5.00,"used it after brushing, my mouth feels fresh and clean all day, then i bought a bottle for the whole family to use."
5.00,"My husband and I really liked this tooth paste. We usually don't buy whitening tooth paste because it hurts our teeth but this one was different. We had no problems at all with this one - it wasn't too \"spicy\" or too harsh on our teeth and the taste was very refreshing and long lasting as well. All in all a great product."
4.00,"I purchased the rinse to get ready for my next dental appt since I hadn't been to one in over a year. The dentist was very pleased with how my teeth were overall with the delay in visits. I'd like to think the rinse had something to do with it. I recommend its use."
5.00,"I started to use this toothpaste just little over one month ago, I can't believe how wonderful this product is, it real works if you have gingivitis problem, you will wake up with a fresh breath every morning very soon. I have since bought a few more for other people in my life. It stings a little when it's in the mouth, but i wouldn't mind it at all, every good things does come with a little side effect, for example, as most mouthwash does."
5.00,"The mouthwash & toothpaste left my mouth & teeth feeling clean & healthy. I like the taste as well."
5.00,"I have been using crest pro health toothpaste for well over a year.  I have never had a paste that leaves my mouth feeling clean for hours after.  Its wonderful!  I will never use another toothpaste again!  My teeth and gums have never been in such good condition as with pro health toothpaste!"
5.00,"The toothpaste leaves your teeth feeling really clean."
5.00,"I really like the toothpaste, my mouth/gums felt clean and freshened, didn't have an unpleasant aftertaste like some do."
5.00,"This mouthwash was really great!! My teeth looked and felt cleaner after just one use. And, it kept my breath fresh longer!"
2.00,"Please redesign this lid and let me know. I will definitely buy it again."
5.00,"Love everything. My teeth haven't felt so clean. This is like having a dentist living in my house. I am getting compliments from all my co-workers. I am a believer in these products. Always been a fan of the floss. It doesn't fray and it never makes my gums bleed. The toothpaste is refreshing."
3.00,"This Mouth Rinse is just OK. It performs perfectly well, as far as I can tell, but I don't find it exceptional in any way. Others have reported that this product can stain the teeth, and while I have not personally seen this, I can't speak for anyone else. What I can say with certainty is that I've not been so impressed by this Mouth Rinse that I would consider it, given the claims of staining."
4.00,"Actually helped remove plaque from my teeth. Helps me keep the super clean dentist feeling between dental visits."
1.00,"I used this rinse twice a day for about 3 or 4 months. I started to notice my teeth turning darker all around, though more noticeably around the edges. A few weeks ago I was at my dentist's for my semi-annual cleaning and the hygienist started asking me if I started drinking coffee, smoking, drinking lots of red wine because my teeth were extremely stained. I mentioned that I had been using this mouthwash and she immediately shook her head and said \"That's it.\" Apparently I was the second person they saw that had this issue. She was able to remove most of the stains, fortunately, and recommended I use Listerine instead. Since making the switch from this mouthwash to Listerine, my teeth are staying nice and white."
5.00,"I've use Pro Health for a few years now. It's all I use for myself anymore. It's still good & some of the best toothpaste out there."
3.00,"I like that the Crest Pro-Health Clinical Mouthwash is alcohol-free so it didn't burn and made my mouth feel fresh. But it also left a film on my teeth and gums after using it. It was very foamy and left behind a residue that had to then be rinsed with water or brushed off."
1.00,"I am a huge fan of Crest toothpaste...especially the Pro-Health. There has got to be something wrong with this last batch we bought. The Clean Mint is a mess!! As soon as you open it, it runs all out of the tube. Every night when I come back to use it , it has pooled out all over the bathroom counter!! Not enough thickener?? Not sure what happened here...will never buy this kind again."
1.00,"A few weeks ago I realized that I must have some kind of infection, possibly gingivitis, but I just switched jobs so I don't have insurance until next week. So, I found this toothpaste (along with the mouth wash) and thought that it could help until I could go to the dentist. I used both twice a day as recommended. Almost immediately I noticed that my gums seemed to be receding. Then my teeth started becoming discolored and I noticed blister looking sores under my tongue and some peeling of my cheeks. I thought that my infection was just getting worse. Then my lips started feeling numb and 2 mornings ago I woke up and almost chocked on a huge piece of skin that had come detached from under my tongue. My lower lip was numb and swollen. I goggled \"skin peeling off of my mouth\" because it was gross and came upon several mentions of this toothpaste. My mouth was so sore that day that I could not even eat a hamburger patty with mustard on it because the mustard burned so badly. I discontinued both the toothpaste and mouth wash immediately and now, 2 days later, it is a lot less painful and as of today I don't have any skin peeling, my lips and under my tongue is still sore but there is no swelling or numbness for my lips. I would not recommend anyone to ever use this product!"
4.00,"This works well but has a very foamy feeling in your mouth."
5.00,"I am now hooked on the Crest Pro Health Mouthwash. The taste is not over powering and it works great. Let my mouth feeling clean."
5.00,"i thought the taste was great and it was great value for the money!"
5.00,"I really like this rinse because it leaves my mouth feeling really fresh and clean!! Another reason that I like it is because it does not contain alcohol. There is no burning sensation like there is with most other mouthwashes. Nice tasting too!"
5.00,"I loved the toothpaste! It left my mouth feeling really clean and my breath fresh!"
1.00,"I didn't buy this from Amazon, and I wish that I had because I would have seen these reviews. After using this product for about 2 weeks, I noticed my teeth were getting brown stains. The only thing that I have done differently from normal is to use Crest Pro Health. Now a week later, after only 2 weeks of use, my teeth still have brown stains on them. I'm hoping that they come out with extended sonicaire brushing focussing on those spots. If that doesn't work I really hope my dentist will get them out. Horrible product!"
5.00,"My mouth felt super clean afterwards! A little pricey, but well worth the money."
5.00,"Love the Pro Health Clinical Control Placque toothpaste, I have always used Crest oral products and this toothpaste is great, like all of the Crest pro-health line, really makes my mouth feel clean after brushing and when I get up in the morning. And it is beneficial for your teeth. Will definitely purchase again."
5.00,"My family fully enjoyed this new Plaque Control product from Crest. We can't wait to continue to use it. Our mouths felt much cleaner and stayed fresher longer."
5.00,"This toothpaste is high quality to help me reduce cavity and other issues. After each clean, the toothpaste leave a fresh smelling in mouth, which brings confidence. This is a 5-star purchase on Amazon.com."
1.00,"I have been a Crest user since I was a kid. This is the brand of toothpaste I grew up on and thus, a certain amount of brand loyalty (call it trust, really) was built into my decision to purchase this product. I used to use Crest toothpaste (until now), and as for mouthwash, had tried Listerine before this (which I found fairly strong, a little too strong for my taste), and Closys (which I really liked as it did not contain alcohol and I found it quite mild yet effective). I ran out of Closys one day (it was prescribed and given to me by my dentist) and I went without mouthwash for a few weeks. Finally, while walking through my local Sam's club, I noticed the Crest Mouthwash and decided to give it a shot. After all, like Closys, it had no alcohol, and also had fluoride like my Carifree® after-brushing fluoride paste. I could kill two birds with one stone! My dentist would probably slap me for doing so, but yes, I picked it up, took it home and rinsed with it for a few nights. This is where I started to notice that maybe, just maybe...something was rotten in Denmark...                                                                     The first day I tried it I lost the ability to taste food. My taste buds just stopped working. Next, after two days of use, was the severe burning in my mouth, on the inside of my cheeks. My cheeks then started to swell, and not only burned, but were extremely sensitive to the touch. My girlfriend was also using it, and unfortunately, fared much worse. Besides the hallmark loss of taste, her gums were in severe pain. Her cheeks became swollen and also painful to the touch, and the swelling then continued up her jaw and to her ear. However, her lymph nodes also became inflamed and sensitive to the touch. She had trouble swallowing food and liquids due to the pain, and had to deal with days of headaches and throbbing in her jaw.                                                                     She went to the dentist to try and figure out what the problem was, and her dentist could not figure it out. Until after a few days, we both discussed our symptoms together for the first time and put two and two together. They all matched, except her's was more severe. We both had our symptoms start on the same day. Mine seemed less severe because I chose to rinse my mouth out after rinsing with the Crest mouthwash. The directions say to leave it in without rinsing for 30 minutes. My situation could have been much worse had a followed these directions.                                                                     Perhaps you will not have these issues (I didn't have the teeth staining issue it warns about on the bottle). But in case you do, hopefully you research and come across this information early to forgo the pain caused to others by this mouthwash. It seems to me that there was very little if any product testing done on this mouthwash, and if there was, it was possibly not enough. In my opinion, after using it, this product is utter garbage at best and possibly harmful to your health at worst. With so many time tested alternatives on the market, its simply not worth even trying in my opinion due to the risk of adverse reactions, and loss of time in trying to recoup your costs from the company if it doesn't work out. How a company can continue to sell this product is beyond me. The damage to the Crest brand might be hard to quantify, but if they keep selling garbage like this, it could be fairly impactful. Trust is a key ingredient in products we put in our bodies. A business that operates in this market segment needs to get it right, or make it right. Period. Despite what focus tests and market research might say, the core reason I chose to buy Crest products was not because they have 50 features like whitening, anti-cavity formulas and say the words \"Pro\" on the bottle. All of these \"features\" dont mean squat without trust. You dont need to go to business school to figure that out, or to understand what losing a customer means in the \"Information Age\".                                                                     A quick Google search online brings up countless complaints against this mouthwash, listing the same symptoms, so we are obviously not alone. We stopped using it that day, and the symptoms are \"slowly\" receding. As I mentioned above, perhaps different people react differently, and not everyone will suffer these issues. If not, then the product could be a good fit for you. However, for many it seems (as I write this 83% of the amazon reviews for this mouthwash are 1 star), this is not the case, and the incidents seem far more than isolated. I will attempt to get my money back, and will write another review based on how the company handles its customers.                                                                     *Addition: do a quick search on Cetylpyridinium chloride, the key antibacterial agent in Crest Pro Care Mouthwash, and you will find some interesting information from a variety of sources. Cetylpyridinium chloride can make your mouth or throat numb, increase the risk of severe allergic reactions, such as swelling of the mouth, face, lips or tongue, labored breathing, rashes, and hives and ingesting high concentrations of cetylpyridinium chloride can lead to lung damage. Cetylpyridinium chloride is toxic if swallowed or inhaled. When this toxic chemical was tested on animals the following symptoms occurred: nasal discharge, respiratory difficulty, weight loss, bloody tears, and inflammation of the iris, cornea and aqueous humor (the fluid part of the eye). Other adverse effects found in animal testing include nervous depression, convulsions and limb paralysis. Yay. Sounds like something awesome to put in your mouth right? Wrong!!"
4.00,"I was very pleased with this toothpaste from Crest. I think it will replace the current other brand my family was using."
5.00,"I love the way my teeth feel; clean and smooth. : ) Just like after a cleaning at the dentist. The flavor is just right, not over powering. : )"
4.00,"Made my teeth feel nice and clean and I liked the taste and smell. Nice size tube for the price."
2.00,"although the cap on the toothpaste tube is attached, it does not easily close completely and the goopy paste \"bleeds\" out and makes a mess!! This cap design is faulty."
5.00,"This is the best mouthwash I have ever used. It truly makes your mouth feel fresh and your teeth feel squeaky clean after brushing. Great product :)"
3.00,"We loved the taste first. Then the feeling of clean stayed with us for a long time. That was a bonus!"
1.00,"Started to get brown stains in between my bottom, front teeth. I did some research online to try and figure out what was causing it and came across the reviews on Amazon. This product should be taken off the market."
4.00,"I liked the mouth wash from Crest. It was a bit strong the first time I tried it but after a few times using it I realized that my mouth felt fresher longer throughout the day. I used at night before going to bed and in the morning I still tasted the mint flavor and my mouth felt cleaner and fresh tasting."
5.00,"I love the toothpaste. I have used for over a month now and my teeth feel and look like I just went to the dentist"
5.00,"This is by far my favorite rinse -- works and tastes great."
5.00,"I love this toothpaste. My teeth feel nice and clean. Great taste."
4.00,"I could not expect much more than what I bought toothpaste. It does the job very well! I am happy with my purchase!"
1.00,"This is a terrible product. After three days of use, yes three days,my lower front teeth were so sensitive that I could hardly eat. If I touched the teeth, I was in horrible pain. I also ended up with blood blisters inside my mouth. The pain stopped after I stopped using the mouth wash, but I wondered and still wonder what the product did to my teeth."
3.00,"Great product. It is a key part of my dental routine."
5.00,"I'm using the sensitive teeth formulation of this product and it seems to be doing a very good job of cleaning while not causing any pain."
4.00,"very great product keep teeth and breath fresh and clean been using for a long time now i luv crest pro health as well as the mouth wash."
5.00,"The clean refreshing taste will keep me purchasing this and the plaque fighting is an added bonus."
4.00,"It has a good taste and leaves your mouth clean and fresh feeling. Not sure that I could tell if it whitened any. All in all, I was pleased."
5.00,"Does not sting or give bad after taste when done using product! :D GREAT for cleaning and not hard on my gums!"
5.00,"I love the fresh, clean feeling I have in my mouth after using the Crest Pro-Health Rinse, and it lasts a long time. I would definitely buy it again."
5.00,"It was great my teeth felt soo clean after I used it."
5.00,"My husband uses a lot of this product. I have to keep it in stock. He doesn't want to run out."
1.00,"This is seriously deceptive. The seller, as you can see in the picture, has photoshopped out the background. He also doesn't give the size of the bottles in the listing. Most people, myself included, wouldn't have thought they made bottles this small, and assumed based on the edited picture that these were regular bottles. However, they are tiny sample-sized bottles good for only 1 or 2 uses. Total rip off. For chrissakes the full-sized 1L bottles are only $6.99 at publix."
4.00,"The new trend in mouthwash is \"antibacterial/antimicrobial\" mouth wash. Like any mouthwash of this type, this comes with a warning, \"In some cases, antimicrobial rinses may cause surface staining to teeth. This is not permanent or harmful and may be prevented by adequate brushing or removed at your next dental visit.\" This is a common side effect of antibacterial mouthwash. The other common type of mouthwash is antiseptic mouthwash, and it uses alcohol. So, most alcohol free mouthwashes will be antibacterial, and will thus have the possibility of discoloring your teeth. Personally, I don't have any discoloration issues with antibacterial mouthwash. (I was told to use an alcohol free mouthwash during my pregnancy.) The taste of this particular mouthwash is pleasant enough and leaves my mouth with a clean enough feeling."
1.00,"I NEVER WRITE REVIEWS FOR ANYTHING AND HAVE BEEN SHOPPING WITH AMAZON FOR OVER 5 YEARS, BUT I MUST WARN PPL ABOUT THIS. IT HAS KILLED MY TASTE BUDS COMPLETELY AFTER ONE USE, HAVE NOT USED IT FOR 2 DAYS NOW AND I STILL DONT HAVE ANY TASTE. MY TONGUE BURNS AND LOSS OF TASTE, I REALLY HOPE THIS IS NOT PERMANENT. THIS GARBAGE NEEDS TO BE RECALLED IMMEDIATELY ARE YOU JOKING ME!?!?!"
4.00,"I've only used the product for two weeks and so far I am impressed with the results. My teeth feel very clean after every brushing."
5.00,"I am enjoying the Crest Pro Health Plaque control toothpaste. It leaves a long lasting clean feel to my mouth. I would buy this again."
5.00,"Love this toothpaste. Will be our new brand from now on!"
4.00,"This product was good, left teeth feeling clean and mouth refreshed."
5.00,"I've read some things about this product that were not favorable, but for me this product has my dentist telling me what healthy gums I have, etc.  I wear a night guard and so I was concerned about bacteria build up and so I looked for a product with no alcohol as I also have dry mouth.  I hope Crest never stops making this."
1.00,"don't buy it. i rarely write review. i am an easy-satisfied customer. however, not for this toothpaste. it's like liquid/gel toothpaste, like those you'll find at .99 store. this has harsh taste. it's like put bleach in your mouth after brushing. don't buy and waste your $$$. trust me"
1.00,"I DO NOT LIKE THIS FORMULA AT ALL. IN MY CASE I MUST BE ALLERGIC. INSIDE MOUTH & ON LIPS SKIN PEELS OFF. ALSO SEEMS WATERY. I JUST DO NOT LIKE PRO-HEALTH TOOTHPAST."
5.00,"I absolutely love the new Crest toothpaste. I love the taste of it and it cleaned my teeth better than any toothpaste I ever used. I highly recommend it!"
4.00,"My teeth felt squeaky clean after using this product. I would definitely use it again."
4.00,"I like using Crest ProHealth products. The paste specifically had a great taste and left my teeth fresh and clean. I dont see difference on my teeth being whiter, but i still like the product."
4.00,"My teeth felt very clean after using. It was not too strong a flavor. I would definately recommend it."
4.00,"This was a really great toothpaste for the price. It worked really well and left my mouth feeling clean and refreshed."
5.00,"Gingivitis is a B and then you die. Is that how the story goes? Not so fast my friend. Let Crest help you stand up to deadly victimize-r. Let's get clinical."
1.00,"Beware. I started using this toothpaste and started getting a white mucus in my mouth. It's apparently the skin coming off from the inside of my mouth because of this toothpaste.  Stopping use of this product I would have preferred something that didn't take the skin off my mouth. I don't know how they can sell this junk."
4.00,"I received a sample at the dentist's office, Made my teeth feel smooth, the same sensation I get just after a teeth cleaning."
4.00,"I had been using Sensodyne Pronamel Gentle Whitening Toothpaste, Alpine Breeze, 4-Ounce Tubes (Pack of 3) since my teeth are sensitive. I decided to try this Crest toothpaste since it seems similar. Both have similar tubes/caps - I like that they stand up taking up less room on the counter. However, I like the Crest flip cap better - easier access. Since I've been using Crest - I have not had any sensitivity coming back, so I think that part works. I've not noticed any difference in whitening. The taste is very strong (and stronger than Sensodyne). The biggest thing I noticed is the texture - it seemed thick and a little gritty. After I rinsed, I didn't feel there was anything left in my mouth, which was good. I did not experience any irritations like some people have mentioned. I think its a good paste, but it depends on whether you want something that is strong and thick or not."
4.00,"Yes it does have an effect on your taste buds and does burn a bit while using it but it goes away the next day or so. Do it at night before bed. It DOES keep the fuzzies/Gingivitis off your teeth for a while too and it may ROLL back Gingivitis too so it's a good product. It MAY do the browning everyone mentions if you don't brush BEFORE using it as the germs etc stuck on your teeth \"die\" and turn brown. If you brush beforehand you're fine! My recommendation is use it once or twice a WEEK, NOT once or twice a DAY and you'll be fine. It's even been cut in half in price at most stores due to reviews here and elsewhere so get it while it lasts! Crest needs to just fix the recommendation of daily use as well as needs to emphasize that you NEED to brush thoroughly immediately BEFORE use."
4.00,"This is a good mouthwash, not too strong to wash with, but it leaves my mouth not able to taste anything else for a while afterward. It's good if you're not going to eat or drink anything afterward for a long time."
4.00,"I like the way it foams up. I don't find much difference between the regular kind and the night version. It's also a little pricey it's nice for my gum issues."
5.00,"I love this product; it leaves my mouth with such a clean, fresh feeling. Would definitely recommend."
4.00,"I have been using it for a long time and it is a great product but feel it is no longer on the market. I have not been able to find it in any stores. I would prefer the larger size."
4.00,"This toothpaste helped make my mouth and teeth feel cleaner and after using it over a period of time my teeth seem to even be a little brighter and whiter. I am hopeful the dentist will tell me next visit my plaque problems have improved after using it, too!"
1.00,"I Bought This Last Night at Walmart thinking it was going to do wonders because its crest and i do love there toothpaste but this stuff that i have on used twice my teeth started hurting my taste buds feel like they have been burnt off i wonder what did they do and why is this being sold still im so glad i read reviews today and didnt use it long enough for my teeth to turn brown but i wonder why they are still selling this and from this i no longer want to use any crest items"
5.00,"This is definitely a very good quality toothpaste and it works well, but I think I picked up a flavor I didn't like because I had to force myself not to grab the other tube of toothpaste the whole week I was trying this one out. My husband didn't mind the flavor though."
3.00,"This Crest \"Pro-Health For Life\" mouthwash is OK tasting and does freshen up my breath, but I have not noticed any significant improvement in my gum health since starting to use it. This is likely a product that will take several months to show any real health improvement but I find that it does effect my sense of taste, so will not use it anymore when this bottle is empty.CFH"
5.00,"This mouthwash is better than any other I've ever used. It makes my mouth feel very clean and doesn't taste medicinal. Love it!"
4.00,"No problems at the dentist and brushing longer at home"
4.00,"Time will tell, but I would buy this again and I would recommend it to friends."
5.00,"crest mouth wash is absolutely amazing. if you havent tried i would highly recommend it. i have been using crest productsfor years and my teeth look amazing!!! my breath smell great and my gums look super healthy."
4.00,"Teeth looked whiter, mouth felt cleaner. When I used Crest Plaque Control toothpaste."
4.00,"I noticed a huge difference with how clean my teeth felt after using the Crest toothpaste. The fresh clean feeling lasted throughout the day. I will buy this toothpaste again."
4.00,"This product was good, but I was shocked by how expensive it was. I was glad I bought it when there was a sale and I had a coupon. I liked it, but I'm not sure it is worth spending the extra money on."
5.00,"Loved the way it moves over my teeth soft and tender..... Nice one enjoyed brushing my teeth with it."
4.00,"Perhaps I should preface my review with the following admission: I must admit that I'll use almost any toothpaste that's available to me for free, and given how frequently the various major brands will give away tubes of a new variety of toothpaste it's pretty easy to never buy toothpaste. Most of the time I get this free toothpaste at a major drugstore chain, but in this case I was sent this product as part of Amazon's Vine program. I've used Aquafresh, Colgate, Rembrandt, and Crest most recently, but over the years have used other brands as well such as Tom's of Maine, Close Up, and Pepsodent. I typically like Crest the best, and this variety is no exception: Foams up just the right amount when brushing, has a good flavor, and is easy to rinse out when done. As to how effective it is: Well, I cannot say that either my dentist or I have ever noticed any difference in my dental hygiene as I've switched brands of toothpaste. In other words, they all do a reasonably good job and it is, in fact, the brushing and flossing techniques that make a difference in terms of how well a toothpaste performs. That being said, apart from yellowing of my teeth that hasn't been touched by ANY brand of toothpaste or tooth whiteners I've tried, I don't have any tooth or gum sensitivity that might respond better to some brands more than others."
5.00,"If you want the next best thing to that just from the dentist clean feeling, than you have to get Crest plaque control! It is amazing!"
5.00,"LOVE this!! Really helped make a difference in the feel of my teeth and the plaque build up. Looking forward to my next dentist appointment to see if my dentist also notices a difference."
1.00,"After two days of using this product, my tongue was numb throughout the day and my sense of taste significantly reduced. I carefully followed the directions for use on the bottle. Then, I decided to conduct a web search and found that several people were experiencing the same symptoms/problems. I then decided to discontinue using this mouth rinse and contacted P&G's customer care dept. via their website. The customer care people were pleasant and helped me obtain a refund. For the help I received, I rated the product better than I really wanted. The product itself doesn't warrant any stars at all."
5.00,"The Crest Pro Health mouthwash makes my mouth come alive. It's very refreshing and takes action immediately followed by hours there after."
4.00,"I've always used Crest Pro Health toothpaste because of sensitive teeth so I wanted to give this a try..I really liked this toothpaste--kept my mouth feeling fresh for a long time and didn't irritate my sensitive teeth."
5.00,"My dental hygienist suggested that I start using toothpaste to protect my sensitive, receding gums. She gave me a sample of Sensodyne and after trying it (three different times - denial), I decided that having sensitive gums is better than that gaggy, horrible \"flavor\" Sensodyne has (and leaves behind). So, after getting scolded at my last teeth cleaning appointment, she, again, strongly suggested that I try the Crest Pro-Health version. So, I did. And I'm happy (and relieved) to report that this is a great toothpaste and it tastes MUCH better than Sensodyne with no gagging involved. My gums have definitely improved and the sensitivity to hot and cold has become less so. Hooray for that! I'm glad I'm being proactive with my dental care and Crest Pro-Health Clinical Gum Protection Toothpaste has sure made it easier to do so. If you're older and you want to save your gums, one brushing at a time, this is the product for you."
5.00,"Crest Pro-Health has several benefits including: preventing cavities, preventing gingivitis, preventing plaque, modest whitening, helping with sensitivity, and eliminating bad breath. It has two powerful ingredients: Therapeutic Stannous Fluoride to protect against gingivitis, plaque, cavities and tooth sensitivity; and Sodium Hexametaphospahte, which is a stain-fighting ingredient. I loved the gritty texture that helped scrub my teeth clean and left my mouth feeling fresh and the minty taste lingered until I drank my first cup of coffee. I like the ease of extracting the toothpaste from the tube and the fact that is stands on the counter for easy reach. I would buy this again."
5.00,"I also tested Crest Pro-Health Clinical Deep Clean Mint Rinse, which I thought was a horrible product. It made me feel like there was a coating on my teeth. This Crest product however is a lot better and is more like every other mouthwash on the shelves, meaning it doesnt leave a weird taste in your mouth. I liked it and think it did an excellent job of cleaning my teeth and giving me fresh breath. It still had that weird taste in my mouth after I would eat my breakfast 30 min after, but it wasn't as intense as it was with the clinical deep clean rinse. This one doesnt have the omg my mouth is on fire feel either, that you get with some mouth washes. Overall, I liked this product and would buy it in the future."
4.00,"I am usually quite particular about my toothpaste and the Crest pro health series has always delivered on good experiences. I typically use the whitening version or the cavity protection version, but as my teeth tend to go through sensitive moments in life I gave this a go. The texture is slightly chalky, exactly what I have come to expect from a toothpaste for sensitivity, but the flavor was more dull than normal products I use as well. This will not be a product I use on a continuous basis, but it seemed to help with sensitivity after just a few days of use."
1.00,"Someone in my house bought this a while back; it was the purple variety. It left a terrible bitter aftertaste on my tounge. It tasted fine as I was rinsing with it, but a minute or two afterwards, I had a bitterness coating my tongue and it wouldn't go away. I used it before bed, and the bitterness was still there the next day. It hung on all day, giving all the food and drinks I had a bitter quality. Plus, when I was rinsing with it, it burned my mouth. I don't know what did this, since it has no alcohol, but it still burned. I tried it again recently, because someone in my house bought another color. I thought maybe it was just the purple one that was the problem, but it was the same. The person that bought it and one other person in my house don't seem to have this problem, though. Maybe I have a strong sense of taste or something, but it was awful for me. I am not going to use it again, so I don't know if it would stain my teeth like some people are saying here. I'm just sticking to Act brand from now on."
5.00,"I'm loving this pro-health toothpaste. My teeth feel clean and are not as sensitive as they normally are."
5.00,"I think the Crest toothpaste is a good option to maintain healthy teeth & gums. It leaves your teeth feeling clean and your mouth fresh."
5.00,"A fresh, polished clean feeling is what I have when I am using my Crest Pro Health toothpaste. The feeling stays with you well into the day. I really like this toothpaste!"
5.00,"another great tasting Crest product, left a clean feeling for hours"
5.00,"Crest toothpaste always makes my teeth feel clean and my breath fresh. I have three children who prefer Crest products too."
5.00,"This product is great tasting and gives a very clean feeling. My gums feel great and my mouth overall feels amazing."
4.00,"I love the way it leaves your mouth feeling clean and fresh. The taste is good to."
5.00,"I go to the dentist 3 times a year because of plague. My hygenist did not have to work as hard to remove the plague. She said my teeth looked better than they usually do. This is a plus for me and for her. I will continue to use the Crest toothpaste for tarter control."
5.00,"great toothpaste! My husband won't let me buy anything else!"
5.00,"This product really makes my mouth feel clean and fresh."
5.00,"Makes your mouth feel fresh and clean!!! I love the quality in Crest products....it makes a difference!!!!"
4.00,"This product cleaned well, had good taste, and did not \"burn\" my mouth like some of the other mouthwashes. I loved it and will purchase and use the product again."
5.00,"I was very happy with the way it went on and stayed on my teeth so I could brush it around. I did feel that nice smooth feeling on my teeth that I get from a dentist's visit. I would recommend this product to others."
5.00,"Really makes your mouth feel fresh, but is a little pricey."
4.00,"The crest plaque control toothpaste was pretty amazing. You very rarely get that \"dentist\" clean\" after leaving the office. This toothpaste helped keep the plaque away so it was a pretty close 2nd to a \"dentist clean\""
1.00,"I bought this product and used for 2 days as directed. After 2 days I can no longer taste anything, the entire inside of my mouth is incredibly painful, and I'm in process of scheduling an emergency trip to the dentist. This is my first review of any product on Amazon. I feel strongly enough about it to waste time where I could be working to get on Amazon, search for the product, figure out how to write a review,and actually write a review. My experience was HORRIBLE with this product. Stay away from it."
5.00,"This did a great job on my teeth. Made them feel really clean."
5.00,"A little pricey but you get what you pay for and this is a great product. Hopefully effective to save more visits to the dentist. My dentist supports this brand of products so that is good to know"
1.00,"I started using this toothpaste a couple of weeks ago and, like others, noticed some irritation and peeling about a week later. I didn't associate it with the toothpaste but yesterday, when I was getting my teeth cleaned, my hygenist noticed that I had several areas where the tissue in my mouth was sloughing and asked if I was using Pro Health. She said that she's seen tons of people who use that brand and have similar issues and sent me home with a tube of basic Crest. Her advice was to avoid any toothpaste with extra \"bells and whistles\" and stick to the most basic formulas."
5.00,"Hey, Crest! Thanks for the toothpaste. I haven't been to a dentist in like a decade, so my teeth are pretty decayed. Then out of the blue I got a dental student to clean my teeth for free. So, now I will start brushing again. This tooth paste claims a smooth mint flavor, and I won't dispute that. It also claims to strengthen enamel and help with sensitivity, like Sensadyne. This is pretty good toothpaste for the price (full disclosure: free to Vine Program Reviewers)."
5.00,"I have found my new favorite toothpaste! Makes my teeth feel GREAT!"
5.00,"I was excited to try this product since I regularly use Crest mouthwash as it is the only brand that doesn't irritate my sensitive mouth. It did not disappoint - fresh, clean feeling with no after-burn, and my teeth are whiter too. I will be buying it again!"
4.00,"I think the product is good.It kept my mouth fresh all day."
4.00,"I would still use it. I think there could be slight improvements made that would make this a wonderful toothpaste."
5.00,"This has a lot of grit which gets that yellow and plaque off your teeth. Best on the market in my opinion"
5.00,"I always LOVE Crest products and I was not disappointed with the Clinical Pro-Health line. It kept my mouth feeling fresh and clean."
5.00,"Love the smooth clean feeling my teeth have after using!"
5.00,"Love it. will buy again. leaves your teeth sooooo clean for hours."
1.00,"I did not like this toothpaste for the following reasons: it did not foam enough for me which means it probably did not get down underneath the gumline to help loosen plaque, it did not freshen breath unless you brushed 2x back to back, and after brushing the toothpaste left alot of film. I even tried wiping my mouth with a towel after brushing to get rid of the film that was left behind, but even after that, there was still film which is a pain when you are in a hurry to get ready. My dentist said that it seemed I had more plaque this visit than usual, so I will not be buying this particular toothpaste again."
4.00,"Quiet abrasive, so be careful. Definitely cleans the mouth. It did leave a strange film on my gums when I first started using it. Almost as if my gums were peeling(they weren't) but that has since stopped."
5.00,"I really love this toothpaste!! It makes my teeth feel really clean. I know it has great benefits and I can't wait to see if my dentist notices the change."
3.00,"The toothpaste made my teeth feel clean, but I did not like the runny texture. The toothpaste spilled out a lot of time while it was sitting by the sink and I had to evetually thow it out because it kept getting messy"
4.00,"Not too minty. Seems like it really works. Refreshing!"
4.00,"This toothpaste is awesome! My teeth felt really smooth and clean afterwards, and the effect lasted for quite some time."
5.00,"I loved this product. My teeth felt like I just left the dentist office. I know eveyone says that, but they felt so clean. They were smooth and I could feel and see a difference in about a week. I will for sure be buying this product on a regular basis."
3.00,"This mouthwash left a very disturbing film in my mouth."
5.00,"This toothpaste is great and and leaves a refreshing feeling in my mouth."
5.00,"This toothpaste really gets my teeth clean, and it lasts a long time."
5.00,"Flavor is good and my mouth and teeth felt clean and fresh all day!"
4.00,"I really like that way this mouthwash left my mouth feeling clean and fresh breath."
5.00,"I love the clean feeling I have after using it. Would recommend to everyone"
5.00,"this stuff works GREAT!!! I had such a result from the first use, that i began to use it twice a day. It was then, I did notice, like some of the other reviewers, that I had the sensation of numbness at the tip of my toungue. took it back to once a day and have had no problems since. My dentist has noticed the change in my gums, too!"
5.00,"I used to use another brand toothpaste but am now switching to Crest Pro-Health. It provides all I want in a toothpaste-whitening, cavity prevention and a fresh mouth. It's wonderful."
5.00,"This product was actually recommended by my dentist. It leaves your mouth feeling clean for a long time, and unlike Listerine, it doesn't burn to use it. That allows me to swish it around in my mouth longer!! I alwayst trust the Crest name. This didn't let me down."
5.00,"I like that Crest ProHealth are all-in-one products, so I don't have to use 8 other products along with it. Makes my teeth feel smooth and clean, too."
4.00,"This leaves my mouth feeling fresh without that burning sensation. My dentist said my teeth and gums are looking great!"
5.00,"Although a little bit more pricey, I loved this toothpaste!"
5.00,"I love this toothbrush my teeth feel so clean.It does a nice job on your teeth,"
5.00,"I love this line. It makes my teeth feel sparkling clean and fresh."
5.00,"I had been looking around for this product but could not find it. The family has always used crest pro health and we were glad to find it. It works wonders for your teeth and mouth."
5.00,"My teeth felt great after using the toothpaste. I really like the pro health toothpastes, but the clinical seemed to me to give your teeth that almost polished feeling. Love it!!!!"
5.00,"I thought this toothpaste was overall good. My teeth felt very clean afterwards."
4.00,"This toothpaste has a great taste and leaves you teeth feeling just cleaned fresh, it helps my sensitive teeth feel better. The extra benefits from this toothpaste is worth the extra cost."
4.00,"One good thing about this toothpaste is it's whitening properties.                                                                     However it's very gritty, like having sand in the mouth and the flavor isn't very good either.                                                                     I will recommend it for it's whitening effects and it's not too strong where it would wear down tooth enamel."
5.00,"My problem with the Crest Pro Health toothpaste is in the dispenser itself. For the past three tubes I have purchased, they have ALL had the hinge break on the flip top and when standing up, it oozes the toothpaste out - very frustrating and messy. Perhaps your R&D can come up with a better dispenser. Otherwise, I have used Crest since my early childhood and love the mint gel. Thank you for your consideration of this review."
5.00,"My family uses this toothpaste everyday. Crest always has good products."
5.00,"It makes your mouth feel fresh and clean !!! I liked it... It does not burn your mouth !!!"
5.00,"I found this product worked extremely well and will buy it again."
5.00,"I was very pleasantly surprised at how well the toothpaste worked! A lot of toothpaste brands claim they will deliver with that clean feeling that lasts but they never hit the mark. This one did! My family and I love how fresh and clean our mouths feel after using it. And it lasts for a long while and I am a smoker so that is hard to do. I also noticed our teeth looking whiter then they ever had, again being a smoker not an easy thing to do. I stand behind this one 100 percent!"
4.00,"I have only used this a few days. It taste good and smells fresh."
4.00,"I really liked the toothpaste, but agree that it is a little expensive. I haven't seen it go on sale as much as other toothpastes either. I enjoyed the clean feeling and the taste!"
5.00,"I tried the clinical toothpaste. While initially I wasn't a fan of the flavor, I got used to it quickly. I generally like a really strong toothpaste flavor, and this one is more mild. My teeth always feel super clean after I brush with this toothpaste. I Definitely recommend it!!"
5.00,"I love Crest! The toothpaste worked really good. Left my teeth feeling great and looking whiter"
4.00,"This product left my mouth feeling fresh all day. I could see my teeth getting whiter after a few days. I would certainly recommend this product to my family and friends."
5.00,"Love the clean feeling I got after using it and it seemed to last. Great taste also."
5.00,"The only floss that doesn't break or shred while I floss is Glide. It's the only floss I use now because it easily \"glides\" between the teeth."
4.00,"As a few other have mentioned, there does seem to be a bit of a numbing effect to using this mouthwash. Something I can't say I've ever noticed it with most other versions of Crest mouthwashes, and definitely don't recall ever having a numbing issue when using Scope. Also, the mouthwash burn sensation is very strong with this formula, and I'm guessing if my mouth wasn't so numbed by it, the burn would probably feel even stronger. But I'm a bit of a wimp when it comes to the mouthwash burn anyway. My husband who seems immune to the strength of every mouthwash out there, seems fine with this Crest formula and has no problem washing with it.One thing I do appreciate is that Crest did not use Yellow #5 food coloring to make this, since most companies use that color to produce the green hue in their products (including Scope). Some people, myself included, have a food allergy to Yellow #5 and can't use or eat anything with that food coloring it. For those with this condition, note that Crest has used Yellow #6 instead, to create the mouthwashes green color.I haven't had any problems with the mouthwash turning my teeth colors or causing any kind of build in my mouth, and neither has my mouthwash addicted husband, who uses it several times a day. So it seems to work well, it's just super strong in flavor!"
5.00,"I could really tell a difference in the cleanness of my teeth. They definitely felt cleaner using this toothpaste than other brands I have tried."
4.00,"Made my mouth feel fresh and clean ;) I'll buy it again."
4.00,"The toothpaste tastes great and my teeth felt really clean afterward. My only problem with it, is the cost. It is more pricey than similar toothpastes. But I do love it."
4.00,"This product was ok, but I didn't notice anything different about it from other mouthwashes."
5.00,"This crest was wonderful it made my teeth feel like I just left the dentist office, I would recommend it."
4.00,"I like the way it left my teeth and mouth feeling cleaning and fresher for longer after brushing than my previous toothpaste."
4.00,"This product felt extra clean and refreshing! A great way to wake up and feel clean and energized. Price is a bit high though which is why I'm only giving it 4 stars."
5.00,"I LOVE this toothpaste. It leaves my mouth feeling dentist office fresh. It also lives up to all its claims. I highly recommend."
1.00,"I've used this for a couple of years. I thought my teeth were stained from tea, but it turns out that the stannous flouride in this stuff is what was doing it-according to my dental hygienist. She cautioned me that while it prevents cavities, it stains the enamel. So, off to find another toothpaste for sensitive teeth that doesn't have stannous flouride in it."
4.00,"It feels good to do whatever I can to prolong the life of my teeth. Crest pro health makes me feel I'm doing what is healthy for my teeth."
5.00,"First tried this toothpaste after buying it at Walgreens. Since I liked it a lot I decided to order another few from Amazon. It makes my mouth feel clean and the minty taste lasts for a while."
5.00,"Mild taste without taking your breath away when you use it. Works great."
3.00,"Ok so I tried it and its ok, its just like any other toothpaste. I did like that my mouth felt fresh longer."
4.00,"This is advertised as a toothpaste for those over 50. I guess it is formulated to the conditions that people over 50 face with their teeth like sensitive gums. I was looking for a new toothpaste after I found out that Total uses triclosen (the same ingredient in hand sanitizers!). This product seems to be a good alternative. It tastes good, whitened my teeth and yes, my gums did feel better. One bad point, which I take to be just a random flaw, was toothpaste came out the seam of the bottom of the tube. I hope this is not a quality control issue."
5.00,"I love the taste and benefits this mouthwash brings! Helps me in my busy life with my oral health Thank you!!!"
5.00,"this has saved us lots of money go to the dentist keeps are breath in good shape I will keep buy this all the time"
4.00,"I bought this product after I noticed some redness and swelling around my gumline. I'm happy to say that after a few days using the rise, all the redness was gone! I don't know why some people have reported horrible-side effects (an allergy or sensitivity maybe?), but I've experienced nothing out of the ordinary: no burning, no sores, no spots, and no loss of taste. I'm giving this a four out of five instead of a five because of a couple of minor issues: 1) The taste is kind of weird and it does stick in your mouth for about half an hour afterwards 2) The rise leaves this weird slimy, foamy stuff in your mouth that takes a LOT of spitting to get rid of. It's gross but tolerable. Overall, it's a good product but maybe not for everyone."
5.00,"My 4-year old son wants to brush his teeth 10 times a day. I'm not kidding! He is so excited to have Jake and the Neverland Pirates on his toothpaste I have to slow him down. Not only was the price right, but the packaging was a no-brainer. The toothpaste is a blue gel and is berry flavored. It makes the grade as far as we parents are concerned (meaning the toothpaste will keep your child's teeth in great condition) and it certainly makes my son smile...pun intended. I will buy again."
5.00,"Crest Pro Health is great! I loved the way my teeth felt after. They felt so clean! I felt like I had just been to the Dentist! I would recommend this product to everyone!"
1.00,"I used this product for a month or so and discovered as others have posted that it stains your teeth yellow. Now my teeth look horrible. I just purchased Crest whitening strips. Clever sales tactic, Crest."
1.00,"I recently purchased this item at Publix two days ago. I bought this one because it includes fluoride and no alcohol. I have used it three times in total. When I first used it, it was really harsh on my tongue but I concluded that it was a normal symptom since I hadn't used a mouthwash for three months. BUT I have used it three times in total so far and now I have a scar under my tongue. It's extremely harsh! I couldn't fall asleep last night because my tongue was hurting. I have sensitive teeth so that could be a reason so if you have sensitive teeth, please don't use it."
5.00,"I've used this toothpaste for nearly 2-years, and my dentist tells me my teeth and gum condition fall into the top 10 percent of what he sees at bi-annual cleanings. He also reported, \"I wish I could do as well with my cleaning as you.\" Toothpaste took a little time to like in the beginning because it so much stronger than what I had been using. It also leaves a film coating that was a surprise. However, as the mouth condition seemed to improve, the film coating seemed less. To some extent, I also attempted to rinse more so as to reduce the film's appearance on my lips in the morning. Now film it is barely there. When I travel I don't take large tubes, but instead use the samples my dentist puts in his cleaning bags. Those popular brands might work, but I surely wonder how much given how much better I'm doing now with Pro-Health. I'm at then end of my 5th large Pro-Health tube, and wonder what else I would have to accept if it were no longer available, but my reflection to this last thought is never encouraging."
5.00,"Love that it doesn't burn. It was very refreshing."
2.00,"CREST is a legacy brand of toothpaste, having been around since almost forever. Crest was introduced in the United States in 1955. At first it used stannous fluoride, as the active ingredient. The composition of the toothpaste had been developed by Drs. Muhler, Harry Day, and William H. Nebergall at Indiana University, and was patented by Nebergall. Procter & Gamble paid royalties from use of the patent and thus financed a dental research institute at this university. The active ingredient of Crest was changed in 1981 to sodium monofluorophosphate. The product under review is unusual, in that the tube is bulky and fat, somewhat like the new breed of ketchup bottles that first appeared, perhaps, in the 1980s. The packaging is quite glitzy, at least, in terms of the amount of health-related information that is printed on it. For example, we read that the uses include the indications of gingivitis, plaque, bacteria, painful sensitivity, cold sensitivity, and acid sensitivity. However, the \"active ingredient\" is the same as it always was, namely, \"fluoride.\" In looking to the \"inactive ingredients,\" we find silica. Silica, as we know, is sand, which is one of the hardest of all of the compounds that are commonly encountered. This is striking contrast to SILICONE, which does contain silicon atoms, but in a structure that is totally different from that of SILICA. SILICONE is a very soft compound, and it is sometimes known as synthetic rubber. As I used this product, I could feel the gritty silica particles between my teeth. Although it is likely that these were scouring my teeth and removing the decades of Peet's coffee stains, I was worried that the grits of silica were damaging my enamel. Thus, I am not so sure about this product. DOWNGRADED. Initially, I gave this product THREE STARS. But now, I downgrade it to TWO STARS. The reason is that the cap is flimsy and needs extra care to attach securely. The cap does NOT attach very easily. You cannot have the same kind of confidence in the cap, as you can have with the lids of TUPPERWARE containers. Anyway, I was keeping CREST product in my \"food drawer\" at work, and the toothpaste leaked on my bagels. At first, I thought that it was growing fungus, because of the bluish color. But then, I realized that it was the leaking toothpaste. A few days later, I noticed a blob of toothpaste on the carpet at work. (I work in a law firm.) Obviously, the CREST product had leaked out of the tube on one of my trips to the men's room to brush my teeth. The engineers at PROCTER AND GAMBLE need to design a better cap. The present cap is way below standard. The problem arises not only from the poor cap, but also from the viscosity of the toothpaste. The particular formulation used for the toothpaste under review is more watery than a conventional white toothpaste. In other word, the present toothpaste is runny, which causes it to leak out of the cap. Because of the runny toothpaste, a better cap would have been a conventional screw-on cap."
3.00,"I love Crest but wasn't super impressed with this product. Its a good product I would use it again. But not the greatest"
5.00,"Fabulous product. Husband has been loyal to Crest Pro-health for years. Now with the clinical addition to the brand he loves it even more! A real winner here!"
5.00,"Thank-you very much!"
5.00,"The toothpaste made my teeth feel very clean. The tase was light and not overpowering. Thanks you Crest."
4.00,"My teeth felt nice and clean. I haven't tried the Plaque Remover one just the regualr. I still use it. Unable to find the Plaque remover one."
3.00,"Reading other reviews, it seems results will vary, so don't necessarily let this one deter you.It took a while before I put two and two together, but it turns out that this toothpaste was somehow drying out the corners of my mouth to the point where they were cracked and raw. It's unfortunate though because I basically liked everything else about it (nice clean taste, generally healthier gums, nice-looking dispenser). Whenever I stopped using it for a while, the damaged area healed up.Again, don't let this keep you from buying it, but if you start developing sores in and around your mouth, try switching toothpastes for a while."
5.00,"I love a toothpaste that makes my teeth feel clean. This one does that for me."
1.00,"I also got skin or something that would peel off from the inside of my mouth. It stopped happening when I stopped using this toothpaste."
4.00,"Love the way it cleans your teeth. The flavor is not bad either."
5.00,"My husband uses this because he has gum problems. The dentist recommended it, and my husband has seen a change in his gum line."
4.00,"I love the crest pro health line. My teeth always feel very clean. I brush twice a day and I notice less build up on my teeth at night. I aso like how it doesnt burn your tongue."
5.00,"I loved pro health toothpaste and am willing to pay the extra price for the results."
5.00,"Love the fresh taste my mouth has after using the rinse. The taste lasts longer than most other mouthwashes. I like it!"
5.00,"I like the idea of a healthy mouthwash, and this was a wonderful product! The fresh taste and clean feeling I got when I rinsed with Crest stayed with me for a lot longer and I Love that!"
5.00,"I absolutly love this mouthwash! It makes my whole mouth feel so clean and fresh! I love that it has added protection that help me put my freshest mouth forward! I have recommended this product to everyone I know! My family now only uses Crest products!"
4.00,"I liked it I didn't love it! It was nice and refreshing. I felt clean after it, but it didn't feel any different then my regular mouth wash :("
4.00,"crest always have great products, was fantastic! thanks so much for letting me try out products, I'm so much more inclined to buy if I'm able to try"
5.00,"Love it and my teeth feel so clean. Love that it helps with plaque control"
5.00,"Pleasant taste, clean feeling. Works extra hard by the slight foaming action. I will buy this again. I love Crest products."
4.00,"Quality product! Good taste. My teeth feel really clean."
3.00,"I really liked the way my teeth felt after brushing, but the after taste was not that great. In fact, it was pretty bad. It did not have the normal Crest taste that I know and love. Other than that, it was pretty good."
5.00,"I wished from my old toothpaste when I tried the sample of Crest. It makes my whole mouth feel fresher longer!"
5.00,"i'M 87 years old. Teeth the dentist predicted would soon have to go are still good and causing no pain when I use Crest Pro Health."
1.00,"I literally have chemical burns on the inside of my lower lip and roof of my mouth from using this product this morning/last night. I'm like incredulous that they would allow this product to be sold!! But who can I even complain to? I'm going to have to just wait for my mouth to heal itself, but seriously, wtf Crest..."
1.00,"I will purchase this product - it left a fresh clean taste in my mouth."
5.00,"The Crest toothpaste does an excellent job of cleaning my family's teeth. A product I would definitely recommend!"
4.00,"this is a \"good\" product. Seems to work well for my breath. My teeth feel cleaner longer too."
4.00,"I purchased this after sampling. I hope to see an improvement in the general overall oral health on my next dental visit."
5.00,"I really like this stuff, I wasn't sure about it at first, but the taste is nice, and it does what it is supposed to do, it is mouthwash, however compared to the scope that I was using, I prefer this, it taste better, leaves my mouth feeling cleaner, and I can tell its whitening my teeth! I have subscribed to this now, and would recommend it to anyone!"
1.00,"After using only 1/2 of a bottle of this horrible concoction, every tooth was stained, and I had to have my teeth cleaned with a baking soda blaster at the dentist's office. I will never again buy any Proctor &amp; Gamble product."
4.00,"Cleaned my teeth just fine!! Quality was excellent."
1.00,"After 2 days of using this product both my husband and I have burning sensations on our tongues. I got the worst of the deal with swollen membranes throughout my mouth and under my tongue. We also experienced a \"dry\" sensation on the under part of the tongue, it seems to stick to the bottom of your mouth even if you are adequately hydrated.                                              We racked our brains for foods we both ate or drank and then my husband realised that we had just changed our toothpaste. We have stopped using it but my mouth is still a mess after 2 days of non-use. I am going to call Crest and leave a formal complaint."
5.00,"I would definitely buy this product again. It left my mouth feeling refreshed and clean."
5.00,"I love Crest Plaque Control tooth paste. It leaves my mouth feeling so fresh and clean after each brush. I have noticed that my gums are less sensitive."
5.00,"Crest has always been my fav toothpaste and this new formula did not disappoint. I am a coffee drinker and worry about stains and my teeth look great. It seems to soften the tartar enough that it is easily removed with continued flossing."
4.00,"So I already reviewed this product but Vocalpoint sent me a message saying I have not, so here we go again. I really liked the Mouthwash and how it helps me fight stains, and kill germs, etc. I also use it to rinse my retainer after each use. My Husband likes the taste."
4.00,"left my teeth feeling great and clean. refreshing feeling"
5.00,"Tried it , and loved it! Love the way my teeth feel after I brushed, will buy again!"
5.00,"I like the taste of this mouth rinse and how it makes my mouth feel after rinsing. I also like the fact that it alcohol free and has fluoride. My dentist wants me to use a fluoride rinse before going to bed so I was excited to try this. I am troubled by a warning that it may stain teeth because of the fluoride in it. The back label states that in some cases rinses may cause staining of teeth and that adequate brushing may prevent the stains which are not harmful or permanent and can be removed by a dentist. Crest toothpastes that contain stannous fluoride have the same warning as do products other that contain this type of fluoride. I think people need to check with their dentists if they are concerned, as will I, when I my dentist is a couple of weeks. As for the product I like the taste and the way it makes my mouth feel. Fresh Mint is a nice flavor. I gave this five stars because of that and because in the week I have been using this I have not noticed any stains."
1.00,"I bought Crest Pro-Health Clinical Mouthwash so I could prepare for an upcoming dental visit and ease some of the symptoms of gingivitis. The first day after I used it I noticed my tongue felt like I'd burned it by drinking a scalding hot liquid. I tried to remember what I had consumed that would have caused the burn but couldn't think of anything. I also started experiencing an extremely dry mouth.By the third day of using the mouthwash I had developed small red spots on three of my taste buds, further proving they were being burned. It was then that I realized the only thing I'd been doing differently in my daily routine was incorporating the new mouthwash.Crest Pro-Health Clinical Mouthwash is absolutely toxic. I haven't used the mouthwash in over 24 hours and my tongue still feels burned with a slightly numb, tingling feeling. Eating has been uncomfortable and the first inch of my tongue has lost the ability to sense hot or cold. That mouthwash is going straight down the drain (along with the money I paid for it).Want to know the scary part? What if a child were rinsing with this product? Or what if someone accidentally swallowed a mouth full? If this stuff is capable of burning a person's tongue after just three uses, I'd hate to see what it could do to a person's stomach.It should also be noted that product review submissions on the Crest website are \"unavailable.\" This is why I came to review the product on Amazon. Something seems fishy. Don't use this product. It's not worth it."
4.00,"I felt my teeth were really clean after using it and it had a good flavor. It also made my breath feel fresh for awhile. Would buy again!"
4.00,"NEEDED A TOOTHPASTE THAT OFFERED SENSITIVITY VALUES. CREST DISCONTINUED THEIR SENSITIVE BRAND APPARENTLY AND OF ALL THE PRO HEALTH PASTES, THE NIGHT FORMULA SEEMS TO HAVE THE PROPERTIES I NEED. I USE TWICE A DAY - NOT ONLY AT NIGHT."
5.00,"I regularly buy this exact toothpaste and just happened to see the terrible reviews for it. From reading a few recent ones, it sounds like crest is sending us flesh-eating fiberglass laced meth toothpaste. Some of the reviews sound horrible, and I'm truly sorry for those that are experiencing any symptoms. I'm not sure whether I have unique anti-fiberglass chemicals in my mouth, or if I'm immune to all pain, but I actually like this toothpaste quite a bit. My requirements for toothpaste aren't that tough: doesn't brush away enamel, leaves me feeling clean, tastes good, safe and good value. This toothpaste checks all those boxes, that's why I'm buying it again. I'm sure that if this multibillion dollar global brand of toothpaste caused everyone's mouth to rot away, the folks at P&G would have soiled their pants and recalled it day one. It would be in their best interest to do so."
3.00,"not for me, it tasted like peroxide and kind of foamy, i prefer something more minty"
5.00,"I asked my dental hygenist which toothpaste I should use. She said the important thing was to brush so a person should choose a toothpaste they like. She said she uses Crest Pro-Health because she likes it. I like the way it cleans my teeth but doesn't seem abrasive."
5.00,"I used this in conjunction w/the toothpaste. It made my mouth feel clean & healthy, & I noticed less of that \"Plaque\" build-up feeling when I wake up in the morning!"
5.00,"My family and I use only Crest complete and Glide Floss both products are superior to all the other toothpastes and flosses thank you Crest for continuing to make your products better and better!"
4.00,"My teeth feel so smooth - just like I left the dentist's office!"
5.00,"The toothpaste works great. Teeth feels smooth and toothpaste taste is not to strong."
5.00,"The mouth wash is great and keeps my teeth feeling clean all day long. I love it."
5.00,"Love the taste! It really makes my teeth feel clean! Would definitely recommend it to others. Will be buying it again in the future."
5.00,"I use a Braun electric toothbrush and I really like this toothpaste. My teeth and mouth feel very similar to when I come back from the dentist and it feels that way all day long. It's kind of a little detail of life, having extra clean teeth but I like it."
1.00,"I used this stuff for a couple of days. After the second day I realized I couldn't taste anything except spicy, salty and sweet flavors. Can't taste anything sour or any type of unique flavors. It has been 3 days and I still have tastebud impairment."
1.00,"The exact same thing was happening to me and I had no idea WHAT was going on. Then I read the reviews here which made perfect sense!!! Left me with random brown spots in my teeth (I thought they were cavities at first) I bought two packs of it and is through 1/2 of one of them. Now I have to throw them away or something! such waste of money!"
5.00,"My kids (8 and 10) have been washing their teeth with this toothpaste for 1 year and no cavities since then. It is great for their breath."
5.00,"This is the best toothpaste I've ever used. I am very picky about my oral products and this one gets 5 stars. I just wish it weren't quite so expensive. I went to buy it at the store and it appears to be the most expensive one out there!"
1.00,"I had no idea of the cause but when I googled peeling skin I came across several people and one common thread...this toothpaste. Really horrible stuff."
1.00,"I bought this instead of the regular crest pro health rinse thinking it would be better.. It is better.. Kills all the germs and your taste buds too! Thought I had something wrong with my mouth and was going to go to the doctor until I read these reviews and now I think I've found the problem, the mouthwash! Makes your mouth feel like you drank something too hot and burned your taste buds off! Also have pink bumps on the very back of my tongue! This stuff should be recalled!!"
5.00,"I have been using Crest ProHealth since it first came on the market about 2 years ago(?)                                              I love this toothpaste!  My daughter and I both use it twice a day.  I've even gotten a couple of my friends hooked on it as well.                                                                     I use this toothpaste with my Sonicare and feel like I've just gotten a professional cleaning!  It has polishers--feels like \"grit\" but they dissolve quickly  (reminds me of the old Pop Rocks candy in miniature).  Also, the consistency is a runnier than the old-fashioned paste.  However it has a nice flip-top cap which snaps closed.  So I've never had an issue with a mess all over my counters.  One thing that I've seen most other reviewers complain about is skin sloughing.  I experienced this for a day or two when I first started using the product.  It wasn't that bad!!!  My assumption is that dead skin is a breading ground for bacteria."
1.00,"I too experienced the horrible brown staining by the gumline. My dentist was appalled and coudn't get it all off. It was from the highly promoted \"alcohol-free\" mouthwash. It is disgusting that this is allowed to be pushed to the public with no warning. Beware!"
5.00,"I thought this new Crest toothpaste was pretty great. The flavors and freshness really helped me to feel super refreshed after I brushed my teeth. I also like that its at a clinical strength, but I can still afford it! :)"
5.00,"THIS IS A FANTASTIC PRODUCT! I would definitely recomend it!"
4.00,"I do not like the flavour much, but I like clean feeling I got. I still prefer the regular Crest Pro Health product I use better."
1.00,"Always make sure to read the back of the box of anything before you purchase. \"May Stain Teeth\". Enough said."
3.00,"I enjoy Crest toothpaste, the clinical protection line is one of my favorites. I love the orginal in this line. That being said this is a good addition to the line up. For my personal taste is the flavor was off and it left a weird taste in my mouth. I had my bf use it and he loved it. He has teeth that need a little extra attention. The aftertaste did not bother him at all."
5.00,"Hi, boy all the other review are scathingly bad, but I've had nothing but good luck with it. I'm on my third tube with none of the problems that others are describing, and one of my best dental checkups ever. I don't have issues with sensitive gums, but I do have problems with soft enamel and this has seemed to do the trick for me. Luckily you can get your money back via the 800 number if you have problems, but I really do like it, it seems to cover the range of dental issues I'm concerned about."
4.00,"I really like the way my mouth and teeth felt after using the product!"
1.00,"This mouth wash is awful! I used it, went to the grocery store, came home to make lunch, and then couldnt taste ANY of the food bought! I thought \"wow, this salsa is terrible.\"...and then tasted the new lemonade \"this lemonade is awfully watery...\" and then I knew something was wrong when I took a bite of my sandwich and didnt taste ANYTHING i had put in it. I figured it must have been my new mouthwash! TERRIBLE!!! I hope this goes away! It happened yesterday and I still can't really taste very much. Not even worth one out of 5 stars!"
4.00,"I like to head off \"morning breath\" with a swish of good mouthwash when I get up each day, and I've tried several different brands to see what works best for me. Basically, this product from Crest has a very nice flavor, and it feels like it's doing the job very well. As for the claims about gingivitis and plaque, who knows. I think it would take a controlled study to validate whether this product does a better job than the others at preventing these problems. The way I look at it, it might help, and I strongly doubt that it does nothing. I'll continue using it based on my subjective like of the flavor and how it feels in my mouth and on my teeth."
4.00,"My teeth and mouth felt cleaner i will buy again i will be trying the rinse next."
5.00,"Crest Pro Health uses stannous flouride, which is a superior dental agent but which was replaced in mass market toothpastes by sodium flouride because the latter had a longer shelf life and lowered manufacturing costs. I enjoy the taste and have had a great experience using the product since it debuted.As for the complaints and one-star reviews, I have never had anything like those issues. I brush and floss daily and go to the dentist. Based on what I've read the complaints seem more common with a Pro Health mouth rinse products, and are the result of dead germs and skin in the mouth. So this product may be less than ideal if your dental hygiene is less than ideal, but I have not had any issues."
5.00,"Left my mouth feeling fresh and clean and tasted better than the stuff I got from the dentist."
5.00,"We have used the Clean Cinnamon Pro Health for years....for some reason, the stores in our area don't carry this flavor any longer. They only carry the gel stuff which we don't care for. The Clean Cinnamon is not a gel and thats why we like it. We have to buy this online in order to get it. Frankly, I don't get it. Why don't the stores in Oklahoma carry Clean Cinnamon? They did several years ago, now nothing but gel. In any case, the wife and I like this so much, we buy it online in quantity so we don't run out. You really must like a toothpaste to go to the trouble of buying it in bulk online, huh?"
4.00,"Worked great without that strong alcohol taste! I love using Crest Pro Health, it is the only mouthwash I will use."
4.00,"loved the toothpaste, left me feeling clean until lunch time. will buy again"
4.00,"It's good to have a variety of products to choose from. Sometimes I like Crest Pro-Health mouthwash because it leaves my mouth feeling clean without alcohol. Sometimes I like something a little stronger. The foaming action takes a little getting used to, but then at least I know it's working."
4.00,"This tooth paste has the quality that you would expect from this brand. It leaves your teeth feeling clean for a long time."
5.00,"My husband loves this; he says it makes his muth feel, \"fresh.\" It is a little strong for me, though...but I am not really a mouthwash person at all. I was glad to get the chance to try it, as we usually buy the green color mouthwashes (spearmint) instead of blue (peppermint). This is hubby's new favorite."
5.00,"I loved how this product made my mouth feel so clean"
5.00,"My Hubby loves the Pro Health mouth wash. It is very refreshing and long lasting."
1.00,"who had a horrible reaction to this toothpaste. Same thing as everyone else: the skin in my mouth started sloughing off. I agree that this product should be recalled. Does anyone know what ingredient is causing these bad reactions?"
1.00,"I spend a lot of money on my teeth.  Dentists, endodontists, oral surgeon, you name it, I've had it done to my teeth.  I've spent a fortune on them and a lot, LOT of time at these specialists.  I have my teeth cleaned twice a year and I brush twice a day and floss every day.  I decided a couple of months ago to add mouthwash to the routine.  Since my husband had bought a Crest ProHealth a while back, just figured I'd use that up before buying Listerine (which I've read is the best).  Within a month or so of using it daily, I now have brown stains all over my lower teeth!!!  I was so freaked out!  I used to drink 1/2 a cup of coffee a day, but I even stopped that about 2 months ago, in order to be healthier.  I drink nothing but water and club soda, so they cannot blame the teeth stains on my drinks.  After looking online and seeing all the complaints about this product, it boggles my mind that this product is still on the shelves!!  Come on P&amp;G, do the right thing and get rid of it already!"
5.00,"i love the crest pro health toothpaste. its leaves my breath minty clean and does not have that awful aftertaste that other brands have. would definately recommend"
2.00,"I am going to compare this product to , which is my go-to product.Active ingredients in Listerine:Eucalyptol 0.092%Menthol 0.042%Methyl Salicylate 0.060%Thymol 0.064%Inactive: Alcohol 21.5%Active ingredients in Crest Pro-Health Alcohol free:Cetylpyridinium chloride 0.07%Inactive: Methlyparaben & Propylparaben (Listerine contains no parabens but does have benzoic acid, poloxamer 407, and sodium benzoare)Impressions:Listerine burns because of the high alcoholic content (close to 1/4 of the bottle is alcohol) and there is no burning feeling with the Crest bottle. However, I experience an amazing clean feeling right after using Listerine. With Crest? not so much. In fact there was a flat chemically taste while rinsing and the chemical taste stayed for 30 minutes later.While the Listerine had no warning labels on its bottle, I was alarmed by this warning label on the Crest:\"In some cases, antimicrobial rinses may cause surface staining to teeth. This is not permanent or harmful, and may be prevented by adequate brushing or removed at your next dental visit\".removed at your next dental visit? I don't have dental coverage, and the dentist is too expensive to pay for damages caused by a mouthwash. Its been documented that in a small group of individuals, the Cetylpyridinium chloride 0.07% makes your teeth look like you been chewing tobacco for years (a hard brown-yellow shade)Also I use and I used them last night and found my teeth hurting after using this mouthwash. I did NOT get this with Listerine!VERDICT:I feel I am playing russian roulette when I use this mouthwash. Will it stain my teeth? I rather have piece of mind with Listerine. Atleast that one doesn't have a warning on the bottle about stains that \"can be removed on your next dental visit\". Going to the dentist is a luxury for me, and a beautiful WHITE smile is a necessity. Also I love the CLEAN feeling that mouthwashes give you. I did not feel clean when using Crest. I will use stick with Listerine."
4.00,"I tried the Crest Clinical Pro-Health products and they were great. My teeth seemed 60% more clean than with my usual toothpaste and the mouthwash left my mouth feeling clean and fresh for a very long time. I would recommend this product to anyone."
1.00,"This Crest toothpaste is by far the worst! I actually like the flavor, its that about two days after using it my mouth has about 5 canker sores and feels like it has been cut up. I have made this mistake with this toothpaste before because it is similar to the Crest that I actually like and unfortunately it takes a long time for my mouth to heal after this happens. I once bought a three pack of this at Costco and as soon as I realized what I had purchased I gave it to my friends, but with warning! Be careful, if your mouth is sensitive it might not be the best option. Crest has better options!"
4.00,"Although they are somewhat expensive, they do work very well. I have been using Crest products for years and they are still my favorite."
1.00,"I used Crest Sensitive Shield Pro Health for about 2 weeks. I did not have the same problems as some of the posters what happend to me was very dry mouth, burning sensation on my tongue, itchy throat, swollen tongue, reddness inside my mouth and it seems all my taste buds disappeared. It's been one week since I stopped using this product and the symptoms are subsiding but not gone. I hope it goes away soon because of these symptoms my Thanksgiving dinner was tastless and painful :( I had to share this and would like to know if anyone else experienced the same problems?"
5.00,"I'm not exactly sure where to begin for a toothpaste review. . . This is my favorite toothpaste and the price from amazon really can't be beat. If you're a fan of toothpaste with little crunchy crystals in the paste, you'll like this one."
5.00,"This toothpast is my favorite one so far. It is great at reducing tooth sensitivity, it has a very handy snap on and off cap. It also seems to whiten well, and makes my teeth feel clean, but not a strong peppermint that can sometimes feel too strong. This toothpaste has a mild mint taste. Since using it, eating ice cream no longer hurts my teeth. If you have sensitive teeth, get this stuff, you will love it. Even if you don't have sensitivity, you will still like it because it is a great all around toothpaste."
5.00,"Left my mouth feeling fresh and clean a lot longer than other mouthwashes I have used. I would definitely recommend it to family and friends."
5.00,"I am hooked. I get great dental checkups using these products!"
5.00,"I really like the Crest Clinical products. I felt like the toothpaste really cleaned my teeth and left my mouth minty fresh. It didn't leave the after taste that other strong toothpastes usually do. I would definitely recommend this toothpaste to family and friends."
5.00,"I love the way my teeth feel super clean after visiting the dentist, and the new crest clinical toothpaste had the same effect for me! It left me with smooth, shiny teeth and fresh breath. It is great to produce theses results on a daily basis without having to sit in a dentist's chair!"
5.00,"Left my entire mouth minty fresh for hours! Teeth were smooth. Not too overbearing with mint flavor. Love the mouthwash!"
5.00,"I had never tried this product before, so I was very eager and excited to purchase it. First of all I like the taste and immediately I could tell the difference in this product and the store brand mouthwas that I was using. My mouth felt so refreshed and clean, I had the confidence to face the day and to approach people knowing that my breath was clean and refreshed. Crest pro-health mouthwash, clean night mint•Prevent and reduce gingivitis for healthy gums. The things that I love about this product is, it will: •Avoid the burn of alcohol. •12-hour protection against plaque and gingivitis by using in your daily oral care routine. •Keep teeth cleaner longer, versus brushing alone. Thanks for giving me the opportunity to tr this product , I will spread it around and inform others and now I will switch and pay the extra for this great product."
5.00,"Left my mouth feeling fresh and clean for a long time. Would absolutely buy it again."
5.00,"I really felt that fresh just left the dentist feeling! It wasn't gritty and my teeth felt very smooth after using it."
5.00,"I got the gum protection type of toothpaste, and I absolutely love it. It has all the features I need I have sensitivity, fighting gingivitis and it tastes AWESOME. It's a great flavor, and I am very happy with the way it makes my mouth feel...which is super clean"
5.00,"Left a nice clean feeling and no afterburn. Will use again."
5.00,"My husband and I both really loved this toothpaste- our teeth felt so clean. It was like we just got back from the dentist!"
1.00,"Like so many other people, my teeth developed grey-brown stains. I had no idea that this product was probably the cause. The risk should have been clearly and prominently noted on the bottle.They told me and others: \"[staining] is reported by a very small percentage of people. Less than one-tenth of 1% of people... have raised this concern.\"That might lead you to think that only one in a thousand people experience stains. But according to a story posted at newsinferno.com dated August 24, 2009 \"Proctor & Gamble has said that 3 percent of all Crest Pro-Health users will experience such staining.\" That's one in 33 customers (if you believe Proctor & Gamble). Which raises a question: If the company knows the real statistic, then why are they giving out a misleading statistic about how many customers complain when you ask them how many customers get staining?The bottle, in a place I didn't notice, says, misleadingly in my view, that the staining \"may be prevented by adequate brushing or removed at your next dental visit\". I brush for several minutes a day - is that not \"adequate\"? And my dentist worked hard at getting the stains off, but he didn't get it all. Their wording, like that of their response to customers, might be technically true but, in my opinion, doesn't leave the average reader with an accurate perception of the risks and of the prospects for successful treatment.I called the company (1-800-285-9139) and asked for the staining statistics. I said right off I *don't* want to hear the number of people who have complained. The rep went away, then came back. She then said 99.9% of customers have not complained. I said that wasn't my question - I want to know what percentage of people get stains. She said research showed there was no difference in staining between their product and a control group, but she couldn't cite the research. She said I could find the study at dentalcare dot com in the section for professionals. I looked. Didn't find it."
3.00,"Crest Pro-Health Fluoride Toothpaste is for sensitive teeth. It helps fight cavities, gingivitis, tartar and plaque. It helps whiten your teeth and freshen your breath. The active ingredient in this toothpaste is stannous fluoride. To use the toothpaste, apply at least a one inch strip of it on a soft bristled toothbrush (I prefer to wet my brush first) and brush your teeth for at least a minute twice a day. I did not read the reviews for Crest Pro-Health Fluoride Toothpaste before I picked it and I have to admit that if I had read the reviews I wouldn't have picked it - some of those reviews are scary! However, I've been using the toothpaste for a while now and I don't find it to be nearly as bad as some of the other reviewers do. Yes, the toothpaste is a bit thicker than I am used to and is definitely an acquired taste - I find it doesn't taste bad when I am brushing my teeth but I'm not fond of the aftertaste when I spit it out. The toothpaste does a good job of cleaning my teeth and does seem to be designed for sensitive teeth which my teeth definitely are. I am a bit nervous that stannous can stain your teeth but I've been using this toothpaste for quite a while and have yet to notice any staining. Not everyone will like Crest Pro-Health Fluoride Toothpaste but I haven't had any real issues with it."
5.00,"I love the way it leaves my teeth and gums feeling so clean! The taste is great and my whole mouth is refreshed. It's a great product and I'll definitely keep using it."
4.00,"I loved the way this toothpaste left my teeth feeling so clean. I was not crazy about the taste though."
4.00,"Great product, works better than many other toothpastes but expensive."
4.00,"this had a good minty taste and did a good job as I expected as I have used crest products for years I have seen cheeper products out there but havent tried them they might not work as well."
1.00,"Do not use this product!! Unless you want your teeth a nice shade of BROWN. This stains your teeth worse than coffee, tobacco, red wine, and tea combined."
5.00,"I really love this mouthwash. It has a great taste and leaves my mouth feeling clean much longer than other brands do. I also love that it gives my teeth a nice clean feeling. I have been using it both in the morning and before bed and I love going to bed with that clean taste in my mouth. I definitely recommend this product to others who are looking for a long lasting fresh taste. I haven't been using it long enough to know if it prevents cavities and tooth decay, but with the way it feels like it's cleaning, I'm almost positive that it does just that. I have previously used other Crest mouthwashes and this one is my favorite so far!"
3.00,"The picture shows it, but the item is actually 8oz in total, a twin pack of two 4oz tubes. Other than that, it arrived as expected."
1.00,"DO NOT buy this product! I have been using this for about two weeks now, and my teeth are becoming brown. My teeth have also become much more sensitive in the last two weeks, and for at least a few hours after using the product, I can't taste a thing. I would really discourage anyone from purchasing this product."
2.00,"I was recommended by my old dentist to use the ProHealth toothpaste and rinse.  I gave it a try and for a couple of years, I thought it was working. My teeth felt clean, but always seemed like there was something left on my teeth after brushing. Then this white mucus like stuff starting appearing in my mouth. I didn't realize what was causing it for awhile. At my latest teeth cleaning, my new hygientist ask if I used Pro Health because she could see a filmy residue on my teeth. That's where the white mucus stuff was coming from. It was the filmy residue falling off my teeth.  She recommended switching toothpastes. That was the best advice I have received from a dentist in a long time. My teeth feel so much better after switching. And while I switched toothpastes I also stopped using the Pro Health rinse. The hygientist said it can actually stain teeth inside of making them cleaner.  Switching to a different kind of toothpaste and rinse was the best thing. My mouth feels clean again without the filmy feeling."
5.00,"Since I started using prohealth my teeth have been brighter and so has my teenage sons. Every morning I have to ask my son were is MY toothpaste. It has become a morning ritual."
5.00,"My husban and I both love this mouthwash. We don't like the washes that burn our mouths and this mouthwash is great."
4.00,"i really like the clean fresh taste and the fact that it comes in whitening"
5.00,"I bought all the products and I must say they are fabulous! I have a particular brand that I like but I was very impressed with the Pro-health toothpaste it left my whole mouth feeling so fresh and clean. The mouthwash was strong but not overwhelming. The Oral-B Glide Pro-Health floss had an appealing minty taste and the material is strong. My favorite was the toothbrush it cleansed so well and reached the back of my mouth really well. All the products were Pro-great!"
5.00,"The amount of QQ from other users is hilarious. One talks about terrible packaging because of the design of the toothpaste and talks about it leaking everywhere. I use these types of design all the time and don't have such a problem. You just don't know how to handle it properly and blame it on the design, good job. Others say it 'burns their mouth' or 'causes gooey stuff that is completely unexplainable' and can't quite possibly mean that the toothpaste is doing its job and you have a dirty mouth. I use this toothpaste with listerine mouthwash and sometimes I get the white-lining around the lips and sometimes I don't. I just rinse my mouth in the morning and it's gone. I don't get it through out the day, only when I use it before sleep and i get it in the morning. It's just dead cells in your mouth coming off. Go ask your dentist about it instead of \"googling it and being relieved that other uninformed users have told me that it is in fact the insides of my cheek burning off! Yes it must be that!\""
5.00,"This is a product that I started buying for my Husband and myself the Crest Sentive Shield. Because as we get older our teeth get more sentive. Well, My husband loves his tooth paste."
5.00,"I love the Crest Pro-Health toothpaste. The grainy substance that scrubs my teeth really leaves my mouth feeling clean. I really like the taste and feel of this toothpaste."
5.00,"I loved this! Not only is it great tasting, but it leaves your mouth feeling clean. As a mother, I don't like mouthwash/rinses that contain alchohol. This is perfect for my family."
1.00,"Crest did an awful job packaging this toothpaste formula. I have tried multiple varieties, and every single time the toothpaste leaks all over when stored and causes a big mess. This formula is in dire need of a twist cap. The toothpaste leaks onto the flip cap, making it difficult to impossible to close all the way (this is also unsanitary). When the tube is laid on its side, toothpaste gets all over the bathroom counter resulting in wasted product and a sticky mess. For this reason, I cannot recommend this toothpaste to anyone."
5.00,"I have used crest toothpaste my whole life and love it. Helps keep my teeth bright, and refreshed. Would recommend this product to everyone!"
5.00,"This left my teeth feeling cleaner than they have in a long time."
1.00,"I used this along with the blue formula and it has turned my teeth brown. I was not sure what turned them brown so I searched google to find out what could be making my teeth turn brown overnight. I was afraid I had some kind of weird dental/health issue. It turns out that many people are having this issue and Crest doesn't feel the need to let anyone know that this could happen!! Do not risk brown teeth. I have no idea what to even do about it now that it is already happened. I have never seen anything like this!!"
1.00,"I began using this product as an alternative to Listerine because it is alcohol-free.  I used a bottle or two and then went for a routine cleaning.  My hygienist noticed brown spots on my teeth and asked if I had been consuming more coffee, soda, etc.  I told her no, so then she asked what kind of mouthwash I used, and I told her I had been using this particular kind of mouthwash.  She said she had seen the stains on several other clients and found they had been using this mouthwash as well.  She called the local distributor and asked about having the item pulled from the shelves, or at least have some kind of warning put on the label, but Crest hasn't done so.  I also did a bit of online research, and other people have had this problem.  (It is only the blue bottle, not the green).  Fortunately the stains do come off, but it requires the hygienist to work a bit harder.  I've been telling colleagues about this problem so that they can avoid buying it."
4.00,"I have no doubt that this Crest toothpaste takes great care of teeth & gums. Crest has an excellent reputation for quality. The thing that will prevent me from purchasing it is the fact that it tastes too medicinal. I want a fresh, tingly-feeling mouth after brushing my teeth."
5.00,"I've been a Crest user for years and this product stands up to their usual quality. It tasted good and cleaned my teeth well. It does seem to reduce the amount of plaque on my teeth. I'd recommend the product!"
5.00,"Love this mouthwash! Loved how it made my mouth feel so fresh and clean... my husband loved it too!"
4.00,"The mouthwash coats your teeth, so that you know all areas are being treated. I really think that this is a great product to help keep my teeth white and my gums healthy."
4.00,"did what it promised. taste was pleasant.price is reasonable"
5.00,"Crest is a high quality brand! But the price for this rinse is expensive compared to other products. I do love an all in one rinse that is good for my teeth, good for my breath, and good for my overall health."
1.00,"I really dislike this toothpaste! The only good thing I can say about it, is that it leaves my mouth feeling clean and fresh, but there are other \"issues\" (which I'll get to in a minute!) that completely negates that one plus! First of all, the paste has little foam. I don't know about you, but I like a nice foamy toothpaste! In addition to the lack of foam, it has a gritty feeling/taste to it - specks of baking soda, perhaps? I don't know, but I don't like it - I have to rinse 4 or 5 times in order to rid my mouth of all the grit! It made my gums bleed, I'm guessing because it doesn't foam up. Imagine brushing your teeth with flavored water - that's what this is like! I noticed little to no improvement in the appearance of my teeth, even after using for more than a week. Furthermore, the paste leaves my mouth with this little elastic-like mucus afterwards! It's looks and feels disgusting! Although my mouth DOES feel fresh and clean afterwards, strings of mucus are a MAJOR turn-off and not worth the ONE positive thing I can find with this! I'm going back to my Colgate IMMEDIATELY!"
4.00,"I really liked this toothpaste because it covers all my oral health needs."
5.00,"This is a great toothpaste! I really do like the taste and it leaves my teeth and mouth feeling fresh and clean almost all day long."
4.00,"It makes my mouth feel so clean and whitens my teeth a few shades lighter."
4.00,"For the longest time in my adult life I avoided Crest toothpaste because I remembered that literally pasty consistency that just felt gross in my mouth. My product of choice for years and years was Colgate, but when I started using the Colgate Total Advanced Fresh Whitening Gel Toothpaste, 5.8-Ounce (Pack of 2) I developed extreme sensitivity to cold and heat. This became a problem, not just while brushing, but when eating and drinking as well. As my husband preferred it anyway, we switched to Crest. My husband has been using the Crest Pro-Health Clean Mint Toothpaste 7.8 Oz (Pack of 4)but had been leery of trying a whitening paste again because of the potential sensitivity issue. When I made the switch, however, I was happy to discover that not only has the old pasty paste been changed to a more gel-like formula, but I haven't had any problems with tooth or gum sensitivity. I actually prefer the consistency of this paste to any other. It's gel-like but with \"crystals\" in it that provide some friction while brushing. The minty flavor is rather light, and my teeth and gums feel really clean after brushing. I can't honestly say that my teeth are getting any whiter, but they do seem like they are shinier. That might be the fact that I'm paying more attention to my brushing, or it might actually be a change in my teeth, who knows. In any case, I'm sticking with the Pro-Health line of dental products. I like the variety that allows me to switch it up once in a while but that also gives me consistency. And while I haven't noticed a dramatic change in whiteness, my husband has started using the Crest 3d White Luxe Glamorous White Toothpaste Twin Pack 2 X 4.1 Oz and the difference is visible and dramatic!"
4.00,"I really liked this, tasted fresh and clean and my breath felt good most of the day"
5.00,"I love brushing my teeth with this toothpaste. My mouth feels and smells clean when I am finished."
5.00,"Toothpaste with all the attributes I need and I love the Cinnamon taste which is very difficult to find in the local stores."
5.00,"Great toothpaste, left my teeth feeling smooth and clean, and had a nice flavor not to strong."
1.00,"The toothpaste is fine but I am tired of cleaning out of the drawer, off the counter, etc. because the cap does not close. You need to change the lid NOW. Over 1/2 of the toothpaste has been wasted because it leaks out the cap."
1.00,"My hygienist recommended I use this to help with some mild gingivitis. Of course, I assumed that she knew what she was talking about and got the toothpaste. After my first brushing after switching to this, I noticed that skin was peeling from my mouth, but I didn't think much of it. Then I noticed that my mouth felt dry and that there was quite a bit of peeling, more than I realized initially- from my cheeks and lower lip primarily. I was wondering if this was normal, so I checked online, and I'm glad that I did- so many people are saying that the same things are happening or have happened to them! I've only been using this mess for TWO days... I can't imagine how my mouth would be feeling if I used it for a week or more like some others had before stopping. I can't believe that my hygienist recommended this, but more than that, I can't believe that this stuff is still being made since people have been complaining about this for years! I'll be going back to my usual stuff."
4.00,"This rinse left your mouth feeling fresh. There was no burn and teeth looked bright."
5.00,"LOVE THIS PRODUCT. KEPT MY BREATH MINTY, AND REMOVED THE PLAQUE. GREAT PRODUCT"
1.00,"I HAD THOUGHT THAT FLORIDE TOOTHPASTE WOULD BE BENEFICIAL FOR MY TEETH BUT IT TURNED OUT THAT I HAD WHITE STRINGY SKIN COMING OFF THE INSIDES OF MY MOUTHAS WELL AS I DEVELOPED RED BUMPS & BURNING ON INSIDES OF MY LIPS...I DONT GET WHAT INGREDIENT IS CAUSING THIS PROBLEM. WHEN I CALLED THE COMPANY THEY RETURNED MY MONEY PROMPTLY BUT SAID THEY HAD NEVER HEARD ANY PRIOR COMPLAINTS ABOUT THIS TYPE OF PROBLEM..THEY OF COURSE ADVISED TO CEASE USING THE PRODUCT...MY MOUTH WAS BACK TO NORMAL WITHIN A WEEK AFTER GOING BACK TO MY OLD TOOTHPASTE...WHAT IS CAUSING THIS ISSUE?"
4.00,"This works really well to keep teeth nice and clean in-between dentist appointments."
1.00,"This product sucks. I used it 1-2 times a day for about four days, and today I have no taste! I can't taste anything! My teeth are also getting yellow in the corners. Using windex would be just as good as using this blue devil's liquid"
1.00,"I bought this product, and did read the small print in the back. I thought that the message saying it would cause stain on teeth meant that some white spots could appear on teeth. Then at some point I noticed light browning in between my bottom teeth. After looking this up on internet, I realized that this mouthwash can be the cause. I have stopped using the product and just planned a visit to the dentist to have it checked out. I read that it's not permanent, I hope so!"
5.00,"I love how it makes my mouth feel. I will definitely buy it!"
1.00,"Just like everyone else, it gave me this nasty white slime on my lips and on the inside of my mouth! It was so disgusting!!! On top of that it gives me the worst taste and bad breath!!!!"
5.00,"Our family has switched! We were all so impressed by how clean and white out teeth looked and felt, that we threw out our other toothpastes, and switched entirely to ProHealth. No other toothpaste that we've tried has helped to give us that fresh-from-the-dentist clean like ProHealth has. Thank you, Crest!"
5.00,"I love this toothpaste. It definitely gives you that continual feel of just leaving the dentists office. The flavor was great, but that's usually not an issue for me, and the effects lasted a while. I love that after drinking coffee, it wiped away all smells and tastes... That's powerful!"
2.00,"I tried the strips, it was okay. Felt weird since i never used strips before but didn't whiten as much as i'm not a smoker. I do like the toothpaste very much."
1.00,"I'm not typically a mouthwash/fluoride rinse user but started yesterday due to the advice of my dentist. I purchased this brand in particular because I have heard to stay away from the rinses with alcohol - I don't recall the exact reason why - maybe it has something to do with the 'burning sensation' other reviewers mention. Regardless, I noticed in the middle of the night that my tongue felt different - almost a numbness sensation. Well, it is mid afternoon the next day and that numbing sensation has not subsided. I checked the reviews on Amazon and sure enough...I am not alone in noticing this effect - with a diminished sense of taste as well. To be honest, I find it rather alarming and wonder what the long term effects might be if used on a daily basis - especially if it affects me this much after just one use. It can't possibly be good. I guess it's time to do some research into a product with less serious side effects."
5.00,"Made my moth feel refreshed and clean, without the burning feeling."
4.00,"I love using this toothpaste... my teeth feel super clean whenever I use it! And the taste isn't bad either."
5.00,"We liked this toothpaste before buying this, but this was a bigger tube than what we normally get. More is better."
5.00,"I first tried Crest ProHealth at the recommendation of my dentist. I don't generally like the taste of any mouthwash, but I do like the taste of this one."
4.00,"Great product. Makes my mouth feel clean without the burning feeling. No bad tastes either."
5.00,"love that it doesnt sting when using, getting my kids to use more often is a great thing!"
4.00,"I love this new mouth rinse. It provides you with a fresh and clean smell I cant wait to see the change in my teeth after using it for a few weeks"
5.00,"I like this toothpaste very much--it provides a fresh feeling, even the next morning. I would recommend this product to all."
4.00,"I purchased the Crest toothpaste. It was great. It made my teeth feel like dancing in my mouth, just like after leaving the dentist office."
4.00,"We like the Crest Pro-Health Clinical Gum Protection toothpaste. The taste is fine-- not too chalky or medicinal, but I have a fresh aftertaste and feel good that my toothpaste is helping my gums as well. I didn't know it was available before, but now I look for toothpaste with gum protection every time I shop."
5.00,"Crest toothpaste has always been my brand of choice. With that being said, I love the clinical toothpaste. My teeth felt clean and i liked the flavor."
1.00,"so supposedly this toothpaste protects your enamel! I bought this at walmart and started using it for 2 months now. This product makes a thin layered of film which is what is suppose to protect the enamel. In theory this sounds good but in reality that thin layer come off if you eat anything or even drink tea or coffee. when it comes off it feels nasty in you mouth because its all sticky and you can see the white layer. So if you want this thing to work you cant eat anything for at least 3-4 hrs after brushing. Its a nice concept but just doesn't work!!"
5.00,"I Love Crest, and I love this product! Keeps my mouth feeling clean and refreshed for hours!"
5.00,"I LOVE HOW CLEAN THIS MOUTHWASH MADE MY TEETH FEEL,ALSO I LOVE THAT IT DOESN'T HAVE A MEDICINIE TASTE."
5.00,"This toothpaste is one that I've been using for quite awhile and love! I have super sensitive teeth and have tried several toothpastes to help with the sensitivity. Crest Pro-Health has definitely made a difference in my teeth. They are less sensitive and feel clean all day. I highly recommend this toothpaste!"
5.00,"I have been actively looking for a tooth paste that helps with my sensitive teeth. This is the first one I have found that has makes a noticable difference in my teeth. I will be continuing to use it."
4.00,"Has a nice mild minty taste. Leaves my mouth feeling clean."
5.00,"Crest and Oral B products are top shelf to me and my family. These produstc are tried and true and make your mouth feel clean and healthy and give just the right amount of ingredients to keep your mouth in tip top shape along with regular dental check ups!"
5.00,"I have problems with my teeth so my dentist really wants me to use some sort of dental rinse. I tried this version because it is alcohol free but still claims to kill 99% of the germs that cause plaque, gingivitis and bad breath. It does not have fluoride. I like the wintergreen taste and it does not have an alcohol taste. It makes my breath smell nice. I use a fluoride mouth rinse at night and this during the day. It is especially good if I have a snack but don't want to brush my teeth. I am happy with this product."
5.00,"At my age I don't worry about cavities, but I do worry about gum disease. Crest is a trusted name, and this product will help prevent gingivitis--and promises to reverse gingivitis in 4 weeks. It also claims to help with cavities, plaque, sensitivity, tartar, whitening, and freshening breath. This could very well become the toothpaste I use on a regular basis and replace my current favorite, Arm & Hammer with baking soda."
5.00,"This is great toothpaste and I've been using it for several years. I ordered a 24-pack that seemed like it was way too low priced... I figure it would be close to out of date or something. The date was fine, but they sent only one tube. I contacted the seller to clarify and indicate I was OK with a lesser number of tubes since the price was very very low, but they actually stood behind the product and shipped all 24 tubes. Pharma Frag did right by me - they owned up to their mistake and completely satisfied me. I'm very pleased with the results, and will do business with them again."
5.00,"My best friend is in his final year as a dental student. He recommended to me these following products: 1. Crest Pro-Health Whitening Toothpaste, 4.2-Ounce Carton (Pack of 6), 2. ACT Restoring Mouthwash, Cool Splash Mint, 18-Ounce Bottle (Pack of 4) 3. Crest Pro-health Multi-Protection Alcohol Free Clear/Clean Mint, 1-liter Bottles (Pack of 3). 4. Reach unwaxed dental floss by Johnson & Johnson 5. Oral-B Triumph Professional Care Electric Toothbrush. This is the regiment he advised me to follow: 1. Use the toothpaste morning and evening. 2. Use the Act mouthwash in the morning because it has a really potent amount of fluoride in it and it's the best time of day for using fluoride. 3. Use the Crest mouthwash at night because it has a protective film it leaves on your teeth to prevent plaque from building at night. 4. Use the Un Waxed floss once per day at night prior to the mouthwash. The un waxed floss scrubs the teeth way better than waxed floss and especially better than Glide. The reason is the Glide \"glides\" right past the plaque and food build up leaving the teeth unclean. The un waxed floss is not for the faint of heart and will take a few weeks to get used to. It is harder to use because it \"grips\" the teeth and you do have to use a sawing left to right motion to get it between some close teeth. But, it's way worth the effort. After months of using the un waxed, I don't even think about it! 5. I used to use the Sonicare for years but my friend convinced me that the Oral-B Triumph cleans better and it does if you do the research. This model also has a handy 4 stage 30 second prompt so you don't have to wonder \"did I brush good enough\". It tells you when you are done! CONCLUSION: My dentist friend says that if you follow this routine, you will probably never have a cavity again! I have read a lot of criticism about some of the products on this list but, they seem to be from people who have poor dental hygiene. I use the tooth paste with the electric toothbrush on high and have had no problems whatever. My teeth are clean and gums healthy. Once you get through \"the tunnel\" using this type of regiment, your gums will never bleed and you will have great oral care! I wish you happy, healthy teeth!"
5.00,"This toothpaste is great. Keeps my teeth clean and bright."
5.00,"This product is wonderful! It leaves my mouth feeling extremely clean!!"
5.00,"I absolutely loved this toothpaste. It made my teeth feel so clean and they stayed that way through the day!"
5.00,"You know how you can feel the plaque on your teeth? I hate that feeling. Well with this toothpaste I didn't feel anything but smoothness. I drink a lot of tea and I didn't feel like I needed to brush my teeth again to be able to get them squeaky clean. This is a must buy!"
5.00,"My teeth felt cleaner and smoother, after using crest plaque control. Just like after leaving the dentist office!"
5.00,"have used this a few weeks now and it makes my mouth and teeth feel wonderful"
5.00,"teeth felt so clean, I loved how my breath smelt after as well."
5.00,"This toothpaste worked very well, when I was done brushing my teeth and mouth felt very clean. I can believe it does work harder to prevent plaque for that reason."
5.00,"I use this tooth past. I ordered one and received a value pack.              What a nice surprise. The price was what I pay for only one tube."
1.00,"On the plus side, this mouthwash cleared up a bad case of halitosis with just one use. I used it for three days. On the negative side, it's been 34 hours since I stopped using it, and food still doesn't taste right. The taste of salt is completely gone, along with sweetness. Just to test it out, I licked up a fair quantity of salt grains. It was as though I had nothing but grit on my tongue. Currently, I wouldn't be able to tell the difference between Coke and Dr. Pepper in a blind taste test. Running searches on this product revealed many complaints related to diminished taste and browning teeth. Interestingly, I've used other mouth washes with the same cetylpyridinium chloride active ingredient, but at a lower concentration, 0.075%, without issue."
5.00,"This product leaves your mouth feeling clean and fresh."
5.00,"I really like this product and also the mouthwash.It helps with whiter teeth and fresh breath."
4.00,"I found this product to leave my mouth feeling fresh and clean. I would recommend this product."
5.00,"I like this mouthwash because it leaves my mouth feeling clean and refreshed, without the sting of alcohol."
5.00,"The great feeling that it left in my mouth much longer than with my old brand, made me want to use it even more!!!"
4.00,"I'm no dental expert, but my Dental Hygienist told me that gels are better than pastes; so first off, Crest Pro-Health Clean Mint Toothpaste (actually tooth gel) gets one star right off the bat. It's a little thinner than tooth \"paste\" and it slid off my standing electric tooth brush; however, I shouldn't leave my tooth brush standing around with tooth gel on it. It tastes fine; so that's good. In the list of active ingredients, there's only one: Stannous fluoride. That's also in the water, but on a tooth gel, you can get more where it needs to be. The inactive ingredient list all of the things that make it a gel and taste good is also provided, but I didn't recognize anything that was harmful or even interesting. Using my Braun electric toothbrush, it acted just like every other toothpaste (or gel) I've ever used. Once I was done, I stood it up on it's cap. There ought to be a law that requires all toothpaste tubes to have a similar cap. It's big and flat and with the gel standing vertically, it takes up less room in the bathroom. Besides, the remaining gel runs to the bottom where it comes out and so you don't have to keep curling up the bottom. A final note: in the past I seem to remember Crest not tasting so hot. It was known for its fluoride. This new version tastes just fine. In fact I like it; so I can recommend it."
5.00,"After using this toothpaste, it felt like I had just had my teeth cleaned by my hygienist! I would highly recommend it."
4.00,"This is a great product. It leaves my mouth feeling very fresh, and when I wake up my mouth seems fresher then normal. It kills bacteria that causes bad breath without the alcohol that's in other mouth rinses such as. My dentist told me alcohol drys out your mouth and can increase halitosis especially if you already have dry mouth to begin with."
4.00,"The mouth wash was great my husband and I both loved it. He is more the mouth wash user than I but I thoroughly enjoyed using it as my teeth felt extremely clean through most of the day. It is a little pricey but worth the money to keep that clean feeling in between dentist visits."
5.00,"My fav is still Crest with Scope and whitening, but I did like this product."
3.00,"I tried Pro-Health toothpaste upon the recommendation of my dentist. It had been years since I had purchased a Crest product. The toothpaste itself is not bad in regards to flavor, but it does lack the foaming action of the brand I have been using for the last 5+ years. The packaging is inferior in my opinion. The tube is too broad/ rigid at the neck. The lid is also too large. It is a serious challenge to utilize the entire product once the tube borders on empty. I am on the fence as to whether or not I will switch back to my old brand, due almost exclusively to the current tube design. I cannot stress enough the need for Crest to change to the traditional tube and lid design."
4.00,"I started out with the Pro Health mouth wash, loved it & moved to the tooth paste also, I am now on my 3rd tube. BUT…I want to know why the inside of my lips peel when I use this? Happens to my wife too. I ran a search online this morning & saw where other people are complaining about the same thing on other websites. So, it's not a problem with our mouths, it's a problem with this. I love the toothpaste & would like to keep using it, but I'm a little alarmed & would like an explanation."
1.00,"(0 ZERO stars!) I first used this after some dental work, and developed the WORST tooth ache and sore throat EVER. I also had deep pain along my jawline that made me think something was terribly wrong! But, I didn't know it was the rinse. A few months later (two days ago) I used it again. OMG!...I have had the worst sore throat for 2 days now, and this morning I woke up so hoarse I couldn't even talk! This stuff is DANGEROUS and should be BANNED by the FDA! As soon as I find out where to report it, I just reported this harmful crap to the FDA! [...]"
5.00,"I have used Crest products and this by far is their best formula to date. My dental appointment isn't until next month, but I am expecting a good report..."
5.00,"I'm very picky with this sort of thing! I tend to stick with what I know and don't like change with this stuff! I tried this and thought it actually was a great product and left my mouth feeling very clean! I would definetely try this again!"
5.00,"This toothpaste gave my mouth a clean feeling that lasted longer than other toothpastes. It helped me feel like I was probably caring for my teeth & gums."
5.00,"I switched from Sensodyne to Crest Pro Health. Crest does more then Sensodyne. It proctects your gums, fights plaque, cavities, gingervities and so on. I've been using Crest pro health for a year now."
5.00,"I need sensitive toothpaste, so I really like this because it's sensitive with all of the other benefits as well, and there's no weird taste!"
1.00,"My hygienist recommended this product because alcohol-based mouthwash makes my teeth sensitive. Initially, I was very pleased with this--it didn't sting like those based on alcohol. The minty taste lingered for hours, but it wasn't unpleasant so that didn't bother me. However, while preparing lunch, I noticed the olives didn't taste salty. I thought something was wrong with them, but then discovered the pickles didn't taste salty either. I tried straight salt, and it was also flavorless. None of the foods I tried had much flavor, but salty and sour things were especially flavorless. I thought I must be getting sick, but thought it was weird that a cold would influence salt and sour (I can usually taste that even if my nose is stuffed up). Hours later, my sense of taste began to return. It wasn't until I used the product again a few days later that I began to suspect that is was Crest Pro Health mouthwash causing my loss of taste. I did a bit of internet searching and discovered other people had the same problem, especially with salty foods. Beware!"
5.00,"I loved this toothpaste! It leaves my breath feeling fresh for a really long time, better than any other toothpaste I've tried. My teeth feel nice and clean after using it too!!"
5.00,"I love this product! It taste great and doesn't have the alcohol in the mouthwash! It leaves my mouth feeling fresh without drying it out!"
4.00,"I like the way your mouth and teeth feel. It is a great product and does what they say."
4.00,"I loved the mouthwash it left my mouth feeling fresh and clean. It was not harsh on my gums.. Will definitly recommend to friends."
5.00,"It made my mouth feel fresh and clean all day and reduce plague build up."
5.00,"I wear a retainer all day and usually end up with bad breath by noon...this toothpaste gave me fresh breath until dinner and my teeth felt super clean!"
4.00,"Loved the Fresh and clean feeling this product gave my mouth. A bit pricey though"
5.00,"I love this mouth wash, you breath is fresh and it doesn't burn your mouth like Listerine."
4.00,"CREST HAS OUTDONE THEMSELVES WITH THIS TOOTHPASTE."
4.00,"I love that this tooth paste made my teeth feel smooth and squeeky for most of the day. Even after eating"
5.00,"This was a great Value at a Great Price. I normally don't look for things like this on AMAZON but I did a search and found this. It is a lot cheaper than what you would find at the Grocery Store. I saved half of what I would have paid at the stores."
5.00,"Buying this mouth wash has never disappointed me and the company lives up to its reputation.Never leaves a after taste."
5.00,"I loved the taste of the toothpaste and the way it left my mouth feeling clean. My teeth looked great!"
4.00,"I didn't find this toothpaste to do much of a different job from the other forms of Crest I've used. I still love it and love this brand. Perhaps I'll see better results after using it a while longer."
4.00,"Used it for about a week before writing this review. The flavor is okay (I don't really care for the taste of most toothpastes) and my teeth felt really clean after using -- maybe just a little cleaner feeling than other pastes I've tried. Good product -- I would purchase again."
4.00,"My teeth felt so incredibly clean. My mouth was fresh!"
4.00,"I really like the way this toothpaste leaves your teeth feeling so clean and white, the after taste is not bad either."
5.00,"the crest products worked very well and made my mouth feel fresh and clean.. this is a very good product to use..."
5.00,"I love Crest and the overall clean feeling that your mouth has after brushing. And I like that there are different \"flavors\" that you can get so you don't get tired of the toothpaste. It has so many great things such as getting rid of bad breath, preventing plaque and gingivitis."
3.00,"I will give the product this, your mouth and teeth feel clean. On the other hand, it is extremely expensive for a small bottle, and it has the weirdest flavor. I would almost call it nasty. Both my husband and I wanted to gag after using it. If the flavor was better, I'd recommend it. As is, I cannot."
4.00,"I've been using the Crest Pro Health Night rinse for at least a year and it's been very good. My dentist just complimented me on how well taken care of my mouth is despite secondary Sjogren's Syndrome and several medications that make my mouth dry.  This is the last thing I do before bed.  It doesn't sting and my mouth doesn't feel and smell bad in the morning.  I have no more brown on my teeth than is normally caused by all the coffee I drink, so I'm not sure what the other reviewers are talking about."
5.00,"This is our families new toothpaste! Both my husband and I will use it, it makes my teeth and mouth feel so fresh!"
4.00,"Love this product. Refreshing and clean feeling. Has great benefits, too!"
5.00,"I have a crest household and the pro-health did not not dissapoint! It leave your mouth feeling fresh and clean."
5.00,"I liked this toothpaste. I thought my teeth felt cleaner, and I would buy this again."
5.00,"My mouth felt clean and fresh after using the toothpaste. Excellent product!"
1.00,"Like other reviewers here have reported, this product caused nasty brown stains on my teeth that could not be brushed away. My dentists' office informed me that the ingredients in CREST PRO HEALTH products were the problem, and that some (not all) people have a problem with it. You can gamble to see if it will affect you or not, but it took a professional cleaning to get rid of the stains for me."
5.00,"Definitely one of the better brands in the market today. It does offer great protection from plaque and gingivitis. Provides clinical results that would please even my dentist."
4.00,"I really liked using Crest Prohealth. It left my mouth feeling clean and protected. I always have to use a mouth rinse and Crest always seem to get the job done. Thank you for the sample."
1.00,"My girlfriend and I switched to Crest Pro Health Sensitive + Enamel Shield toothpaste about 3 months ago. I immediately noticed that my lips were chapping more but I thought it was just because with summer here, I was getting dehydrated. Then, when the inside of my cheeks started shredding and peeling CONSTANTLY, I mentioned it to my girlfriend and was amazed when she told me her cheeks and the roof of her mouth were doing the same thing. A little research and I found out the same thing everyone here is complaining about, it's CREST PRO HEALTH TOOTHPASTE that was causing it. We switched to another brand and the problem INSTANTLY went away. So, I was curious if people using the other Pro Health toothpastes were having the same issues. Obviously, they are. When I read a review making fun of the person who complained about \"gooey stuff that's quite unexplainable\" I INSTANTLY understood what they meant. That' EXACTLY how I felt when I started noticing the \"stuff\" in my mouth. Finally, after wondering where it was coming from for DAYS, I was running my tongue around inside my mouth and realized the skin in my mouth was COMPLETELY SHREDDED and the \"gooey stuff\" I was finding was all the DEAD SKIN that was slewing off the insides of my cheeks! Do a little research people, this stuff is BAD FOR YOU. It is eating the skin right out of your mouth and turning it into a gooey slime. That doesn't sound very \"Pro-Health\" to me!"
4.00,"I liked the way my teeth felt after brushing... Fresh and clean! Great taste too."
4.00,"I have been using Crest Pro Health for a very long time now. It has a nice minty flavor that I really like. I tend to have sensitive teeth and gums and this toothpaste helps with that. I like that this toothpaste has whitening properties to it. After all the coffee and tea that I drink, I could use all the whitening help I can get."
5.00,"I found the Crest ProHealth left me with clean teeth and refreshing breath. I will continue to use it to keep plaque under control."
5.00,"Pleasant taste and not abrasive. I enjoy using this product"
4.00,"would buy again! no nasty \"mouthwash\" burn or alcohol after taste."
4.00,"I tried the mouth rinse and I liked it because it didn't burn my mouth like other mouthwashes have. It tasted good but it wasn't so strong. It did remind me of the mouthwash from the dentist flavor wise, just milder."
2.00,"So Crest ProHealth is supposed to do just about everything: fight cavities and plaque, whiten teeth, freshen breath, and help sensitivity. When a toothpaste makes these sorts of claims, I get instantly suspicious, personally. The whitening and plaque/tartar fighting claims are true of regular budget toothpaste, it's just marketing doubletalk. Notice that the box copy will always say \"polishes surface stains.\" That's whitening in a sense I suppose, but not the sense that people take it to be - the type of whitening treatments newscasters and celebrities get. Some rudimentary googling will confirm this. Anyway, I will move on to sensitivity and freshening breath. I think the flavor is pretty good and it does seem reminiscent of toothpastes that feature \"Scope\" mouthwash flavor. So if you're into that sort of thing, you will find it here. On the other hand, I not only found that this was not a good sensitive mouth toothpaste, but it actually made my teeth feel more sensitive! And this is coming from someone who doesn't have particularly sensitive teeth. There is a grittiness to the toothpaste that was unpleasant. Your mileage may vary of course, but if I were asked to pronounce a verdict, I'd say just save 50% and buy a regular toothpaste. You'll get the same \"surface polish\" whitening, and the same dental hygiene elements. The only thing this offers as an extra is the mouthwash flavor, and I think it's pretty poor on the sensitivity front."
5.00,"Leaves my mouth feeling SO fresh- and I love the taste!"
5.00,"I've been a dedicated user of Colgate toothpaste for many years, but I tried the Crest Pro Health Clinical toothpaste and my mouth has never felt fresher, truly clean. I have officially made the switch to Crest. Thank you."
4.00,"I was thrilled to try this product with my family.Crest is a known product in our family so when we tried the mouth rinse we were all really impressed!Its clean,crisp taste left us feeling refreshed and knowing it was helping to dimishe the plaque was just a bonus!HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
1.00,"After only using it for a bit less than 2 days, I lost my taste totally. At first, I thought it is the food. Then, I realized that I was the only person who keeps complaining about the food in a party. I stopped using it on the 3rd day and my taste slowly came back after around 4 days. It is a terrible product. The worst part is that the manufacture admits this significant side effect, but, never put them on the label."
4.00,"The product left my mouth feeling clean, but it is not a good value."
5.00,"I have been hesitant to use mouthwash because most of them \"burn\" your mouth. I was pleasantly suprised that this did not. It made my mouth feel clean and fresh."
5.00,"I love the taste of this mouthwash...protection. After using it for just a few days, along with the toothpaste, my teeth feel a lot better and I believe they are getting stronger. These were delivered quickly."
5.00,"My dentist was impressed in my teeth and gum health with the use of this product. Always a great feeling after I brush with this tooth paste."
4.00,"My teeth felt like I had just come back from the dentist. I also felt like it helped keep my teeth cleaner throughout the day"
1.00,"My gums and the insides of my cheeks peeled when I started using this product. It was highly unpleasant, but stopped when I discontinued use. I definitely recommend against this toothpaste."
4.00,"I thought this toothpaste had a little different taste which I didn't like but overall it seemed to work well."
5.00,"I love the way my teeth felt after using the product!"
5.00,"I was finally able to try the Crest Pro-Health toothpaste and I am thoroughly impressed! I honestly didn't think that it would be any different than the normal Crest toothpaste but after brushing, I was pleasantly surprised. My teeth felt squeaky clean. My breath felt fresh and I felt like I had just left the dentist office!"
3.00,"so fresh and so clean, clean. This is my choice for toothpaste. It is a bit harsher than some and can cause some cheek cell luffing. I like it because it is strong."
5.00,"I am a convert. Thank you for the opportunity to try something new."
5.00,"I have very sensitive teeth and can not use many different kinds of toothpaste. This product is well worth it! My teeth feel extra clean and are not so sensitive any more."
5.00,"This product left my mouth feeling as though I had just left the dentist office every time I used it."
4.00,"I have used Crest all my life - so I was expecting it to be similar to what I use now. However, it was completely different - and I'm not sure how I feel about that. I didn't really like the flavor - but it did feel like my teeth were very clean and stayed clean for a long time. I think it's a bit expensive - but it does what it claims to do, so it's probably worth it!"
5.00,"I really like the Crest Pro Health Clinical Plaque Control Toothpaste I recieved a sample of.First of all it has a very pleasant minty taste without being too overpowering.Second this toothpaste leaves my teeth feeling super clean and my whole mouth feels fresh.I felt it did an excellent job at cleaning my teeth and getting rid of plaque. I would definately recomend this product to everyone."
4.00,"My husband and I thought this was a great product."
5.00,"I haven't used the product long enough to notice any difference in gums but I do like the taste, feel and fresh feeling of paste. Have always trusted Crest so I think this is probably an innovative and highly researched product and will deliver on it's promises."
4.00,"I love this product. I have problems with plaque buildup and this toothpaste is great!"
5.00,"Terrific, anything to help keep me away from the dentist!"
5.00,"I loved the taste and the way it made my teeth feel after using it. Absolutely love it and definitely recommend it."
5.00,"This works wonderful. I'm a big coffee drinker and normally by mid day I can feel (and taste) the plaque. After I started using Crest Pro Health clinical plaque control I could definitely feel (and taste) the difference. It worked all day. This is the only kind I use now. The taste of it is no different than any other Crest toothpaste I've tried. If you have a plaque problem (like I DID :) I would highly recommend trying it. You'll never want to use any other toothpaste again."
4.00,"I love this!!! Using the products individually and combined my teeth feel fresh from the dentist clean!!"
5.00,"My dentist recommended this toothpaste for nighttime, and it is great to wake up in the morning with clean feeling teeth!"
1.00,"I really liked it because it doesn't burn out my mouth. But, It is terrible to leave brown stain on my teeth. Very disappointed to."
5.00,"I love this product and it leaves my mouth feeling fresh and I've noticed that it keeps my teeth nice and white."
4.00,"In a rush this is the best fastest cleanup teeth item out there."
5.00,"This toothpaste taste good and makes you mouth feel so clean. I'm lovin it!"
5.00,"It tastes great and really cleans your teeth. We love it!"
4.00,"It is refreshing and leaves teeth feeling clean. The taste is a nice mint favor. love it!"
4.00,"Crest is my favorite brand. This toothpast gets my teeth clean and I like the taste."
5.00,"It does excellent on cleaning teeth. I would recommend the product to everyone."
5.00,"I thought it worked as gd as the other whitening toothpastes. I liked how clean my mouth felt after using it."
5.00,"It made my mouth feel very clean and fresh! Will buy again"
5.00,"Our teeth feel clean and our breaths smell fresh! The whole family is happy with it."
4.00,"I like the way my teeth feel and the clean and fresh breath. I would use it again."
5.00,"Crest has a bunch of specialized mouth rinses, and the Pro-Health Multiprotection rinse in Wintergreen is one of the best. There's no alcohol in it, so no pain or stinging when you swish it around, but the taste of wintergreen lasts long and gives a refreshing taste that lingers in the mouth. I've been working hard on reversing the gingivitis in my mouth through a variety of methods. My dentist has been very pleased at my progress. Crest Pro-Health products are part of that regimen. Depending upon your taste, I can't recommend them highly enough."
5.00,"My teeth felt exceptionally clean & my mouth clean!"
4.00,"I'm not really a mouthwash person, but I enjoyed using this product. It tasted great and kept my mouth feeling clean."
5.00,"I loved this toothpaste. My teeth felt so clean after I used it! I will be buying it again."
1.00,"It took me a really long time to determine that this toothpaste is what causes the mouth slime/scum/film in my mouth. But, I didn't want to just speculate. So, I located some information on Crest's own website:\"Q: Since using Pro-Health toothpaste, I've noticed a \"shedding\" of the lining of my mouth. It is like a layer peels off each time I use it. My mouth feels cleaner than ever, but I'm not sure if this is normal.\"\"A: The shedding that you have noticed in your mouth is not unsafe and is a result of the natural process to remove dead cells from the skin surfaces in your mouth. The cleaning action of both Crest Pro-Health Toothpaste and Crest Pro-Health Rinse can accelerate this process and often results in the skin coming off in sheets, making the removal of dead skin cells more noticeable.\"[...]I've been using Crest for the majority of my life and have had almost zero cavities. So, I'll continue buying Crest, but I will NOT be buying 'Pro Health' any longer."
5.00,"Amazing products yet again from a wonderful company! They live up to the company description!"
5.00,"I love this product! It leaves your teeth feeling fresh and clean."
5.00,"This product made my teeth feel cleaner. It left my mouth feeling refreshed."
5.00,"Toothpast really does wonders. Love the aftertaste and keep my teeth from plaque buildup that would otherwise make my teeth feel dirty."
5.00,"The Crest Pro-Health Clinical oral rinse is the best i've tried so far! Cool and refeshing mint taste. Light and bubbly rinse. No harsh alcohol after taste, since it is alcohol free! All in all I love this product! This is the perfect oral rinse with everything myself and my family have been looking for!"
5.00,"I really liked this product..made my teeth feel extra clean"
5.00,"This product worked well... The price in store is higher than others but would be worth it."
1.00,"A disgusting white film forms in your mouth after you use this product. It feels disgusting, and it's embarrassing to be trying to get it out of your mouth. I highly recommend SOMETHING ELSE."
3.00,"The Crest Pro series is a hit with my 17 year old. He refuses to use any other variety or other Crest product. It keeps our teeth clean and feeling fresh in a way superior to other toothpastes."
5.00,"Love the whole Crest pro health line of products. Toothpaste and mouthwash are the best."
4.00,"Very nice toothpaste. Keep my teeth feeling cleaner for longer than the typical toothpaste I use."
1.00,"Terrible product. After the first day of using it I started to get blisters on my top gum line and a burning sensation. Please do not buy this product!"
5.00,"I enjoyed using Crest Pro-Health toothpaste. It has a nice taste and my mouth felt fresh all day."
1.00,"Is this dissolving the skin in my mouth? After using this toothpaste, there is a substantial amount of clumpy mucus in my mouth that i have to spit out. I'm glad I'm not the only one experiencing this."
5.00,"I love Crest toothpaste. I have tried a lot of others out there & it is the BEST. My teeth just feel cleaner after brushing with it!"
4.00,"I really thought the product did a nice job of cleaning my teeth and mouth. There was a nice feel on my teeth. The only thing I would have liked was a stronger peppermint flavor."
5.00,"I love the feeling of having clean teeth all day. I used this and plan on purchasing it again in the future. Great value or an amazing product."
4.00,"Great product and taste, Does not leave an after taste and does not have that strong mint flavor that others have. Would recommend to anyone"
1.00,"I am a general practitioner and have noticed many of my patients who tried this product (never recommended by me) have experienced burning sensation in their mouth, sores and a sloughing of their top layer of their gingiva. In addition many Pro-Health products stain teeth and it wasnt until recently that crest started to post this warning on their label. Overall I do not recommend this product to any of my patients and advise readers to not use it, due to its many negative side effects."
1.00,"This product is horrible. I picked it up when the market didn't have my usual Listerine. My teeth end up feeling far less clean, my breath less fresh and EVERYTHING tastes like soap for hours and hours afterwards. Do not buy this product."
5.00,"This is without a doubt, the best toothpaste that I have ever used in my life! I'm 49, and may have some form of gingivitis (which this toothpaste fights) I've been using this product for about 6 weeks, and my mouth has never felt cleaner. So many other toothpaste have always seemed like their interacting badly in my mouth leaving my breath in question. And believe me, I do the flossing, tongue scraping, mouthwash, but this is the first time in awhile that I feel good about my breath. (even after eating) This is by far your best product to date, so please continue making it . Change the cap if you want to, but please keep the clean mint gel formula the same. Thanks"
4.00,"Love this product because it has no alcohol which means no burning!!!"
1.00,"My dental hygienist recommended this product. Why? After only one use my tongue felt like I had been eating metal. It has been over a week and my taste buds are still off. Does it ever get better? Or are my taste buds permanently damaged? Why does Crest still  market this product? Of course, I can't get my money back because the sales receipt is lost. The only receipt I've lost in five years! Purchase of this product is a definite NO-NO. Have to give it one star as zero star is not an option."
5.00,"I've never had a toothpaste before that gave me that 'fresh from the dentist' clean. Love it."
1.00,"Add me to the list of people shocked from the side effects of this product. I am accustomed to some foods tasting funny for an hour or two past using an intense mouthwash, but this is beyond the pale. I used this product at 8pm last night, and almost twelve hours later at breakfast I still had that post-mouthwash/ metallic/ medicine taste in my mouth...and yes, breakfast was ruined. This sent me running to Whole Foods to try a natural mouthwash. I am not shocked to see the overwhelmingly bad reviews here of people having a similar experience."
2.00,"This product provided no benefits for any part of my mouth that I could see, and tasted bad."
5.00,"The Kid's toothpaste was in low price, and I bought one for my litter sister. She will like the cartoon design."
4.00,"The product is great, a little bit of a \"sweeter\" taste then what I prefer but overall the product meets my expectations!"
5.00,"Better than the \"other\" toothpastes I used in the past. It does cost a bit more, but the benefit outweighs the cost difference."
4.00,"This tastes much better than the \"L\" alternative (not sure I should mention the other brand!), but it does have a little after taste to me. It is much better than the higher alcohol-content of L which tends to make my mouth uncomfortable. I will see if there is less plaque at my next routine cleaning......."
1.00,"I have never had periodontal or gingivitis issues. We got these samples at my work so I decided to try it. About 10 minutes after I finished brushing, my gums began to feel VERY sore and when I checked them out in the mirror were so red! They remain that way the entire evening and when I woke up, I felt a film over all the areas that seemed like they were burned. The film began to peel off and I realized that this was my gums! Will never use again."
4.00,"My breath really smelled great and my mouth felt clean for a long time after using!"
5.00,"Upon using the rinse I was very pleased at the way it made my mouth feel so clean and refreshed. Recommended it to all my friends."
3.00,"It's not a whole lot different than regular Crest paste. It is a bit \"smoother\" than the regular mint as they state. It's a little milder and doesn't feel as minty as the original stuff. Does the job though. Cleans, protects, and helps keep your teeth white and clean. I guess anyone who wants this type of paste as an option won't be let down. I just don't see the difference between this stuff and regular Crest."
4.00,"It really made a difference in my daily oral routine! My mouth feels so much cleaner and I love it . Now I feel confident going tobthe dentist knowing I won't be lectured !"
3.00,"Yeah, it's Crest toothpaste, and so, decent toothpaste. The packaging designer should be drawn and quartered, or at least banished to where he can never harm consumers again. Why do you need a giant plastic dongle at the end of the goddamned toothpaste tube? Why does it need a huge cap that doesn't even seal the hole where the toothpaste comes out? The plastic dongle makes it difficult to get the paste out; my girlfriend ends up squirting toothpaste all over the place (or else it just leaks out when unattended). The cap makes it impossible to seal the damn thing. Why did they do it? To be \"modern?\" Modern people don't like the idea of giant plastic things which served no useful purpose in the first place sitting in landfills for the next few thousand years. I'm no earthy-crunchy type, but I found it wasteful and stupid: and it doesn't even work right! The venerable plastic or foil toothpaste tube works *just fine* -we do not need \"innovations\" like this monstrosity."
5.00,"I like how clean my teeth felt after using it. I think it's a great product for the money - good value."
5.00,"I loved how clean it made my mouth feel, and it lasted all day!"
4.00,"Although I have tried toothpaste with the same outcome, I really enjoyed the taste and feel of this toothpaste. My teeth really did feel clean and I felt confident my breath smelled good."
4.00,"it has good taste,and it is not too strong. always a reliable brand"
5.00,"This was a really great toothpaste. The taste was refreshing and my mouth felt clean. Looking in the mirror I could see a difference in the appearance of my teeth after the first use. My teeth were literally \"squeaky\" clean. I highly recommend this toothpaste."
3.00,"makes my mouth feel cleaner& fresher and doesnt burn."
5.00,"I don't think my mouth has ever felt so clean after brushing."
5.00,"Crest products are my preference products for oral care - their new toothpaste is no exception - Great as always!"
4.00,"We go through a lot of of mouthwash in my house. This product did a GREAT job, but did not have a great taste. Overall, I would buy it again, and liked the product."
5.00,"I like this toothpaste a lot. It has a great taste and keeps your mouth fresh and clean. Great for removing plaque."
4.00,"really satisfied with this toothpaste and wouldnt expect anything less from crest!"
1.00,"I just bought this toothpaste today at Walgreen's.  It came with free mouthwash.  I needed new toothpaste because after a month or so of using the same toothpaste, I bore of it.  After reading the back of the box with the active ingredient being Stannous Fluoride...which it says \"Products containing stannous fluoride may produce surface staining of the teeth.\"  Ok, I'm confused, it says this toothpaste will whiten my teeth, but an active ingredient in it may cause surface stains on my teeth?  Heh.  I'll give this toothpaste to my mom or something."
5.00,"LOVE Crest but really love this new brand! Leaves you feeling fresh, clean and makes you feel like it really cleaned your teeth."
4.00,"Love that it has gingivitis and plaque protection, but wish it had enamel strengthener also. I'd definitely switch then."
4.00,"This mouthwash truly does help my mouth to have that \"just visited the dentist\" clean feel and it lasts all morning too. This would be esp wonderful for those long flights on a plane to use to keep that fresh mouth feeling between brushes."
5.00,"This toothpaste leaves an invigorating clean feeling in your mouth!"
4.00,"This is the first mouthwash that I've actually liked to use! It tastes good (not too strong) and morning breath is no longer a problem. My mouth feels clean and fresh."
5.00,"First of all, I will continue to use this product. I found it not to be harsh tasting, but to have a somewhat sweet taste. It does fight plaque, gingivitis and bad breath and I believe it to be safe and effective. My continuing great dental checkups proves that changing to this product has not done anything to decrease the great dental checkups I have had over the past 2 years."
5.00,"I absolutely love the new crest pro health toothpaste, mouthwash, floss and toothbrush. I purchased all four products together and have used them as a unit i recommend everyone to use them. I will purchase these products again. As a matter of fact after using the pro health and i was so delighted with the results i purchased 3 extra sets for my 2 daughters and son in law."
4.00,"My husband is a firm believer in this product now!"
5.00,"Crest has outdone themselves giving is a produc that makes us feel good about our teeth and gicing us a great smooth taste that does not offend the taste buds in any way. I was impressed with the whitening power as well as the subtle taste that left my mouth feeling clean throughout the day. What a winner!"
4.00,"I have always trusted Crest products and this toothpaste delivers. My teeth felt very clean after using Pro-Health."
2.00,"This product is great at getting your teeth really clean but the aftertaste is awful. My mouth feels very dry after I use this product. Not minty fresh like I am used to with their other products. Will not buy again."
5.00,"I have always loved Crest and their products keep getting better!"
5.00,"Crest is great, this made it better. My dentist said he'd never seen my smile so bright."
4.00,"I have used an off-brand toothpaste my whole life, but switching to this one was simple, and made my mouth feel cleaner!"
4.00,"Pretty good toothpaste, kids like it; 3 year-old enjoys the fact that it has Jake on it and the 5 year-old likes the taste, I tried it once and it has pretty good flavor."
1.00,"Actually bought this in a local store thinking it would be a benefit over normal mouthwash. After one use I noticed a distinct foam that I was spitting out well after rinsing. After a second use, I noticed pain in my parotid salivary glands (in front of the ear, near the back of the jaw). Eating lunch seemed to exacerbate the discomfort, and when I went to the bathroom I noticed my left jaw was horribly swollen! I looked like I had the mumps! I looked in my mouth and could see the opening to the glands themselves seeming puffy.DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT!!! It is harmful, damaging and should not even be on the shelves."
5.00,"I would definately use this as my toothpaste. I like the way it foams up while using it. It leaves my mouth and teeth feeling really clean."
4.00,"I do not normally use this brand, I might consider changing after trying it."
5.00,"Super clean feeling after use. Would definitely recommend purchase."
5.00,"I liked the toothpaste, it left my mouth feeling and tasting clean."
4.00,"Crest Pro-Health Multiprotection Rinse in Cool Wintergreen has a pleasant wintergreen flavor but lacks the invigorating tingling that I enjoy because it is alcohol-free. It does leave a little aftertaste and it doesn't have fluoride which is helpful for people with sensitive teeth."
5.00,"I'm really pleased with the long lasting quality of this product"
5.00,"After using the Crest toothpaste I felt as if I had just had by teeth cleaned professionally at a dental office. My teeth felt smooth and extremely clean. I highly recommend this product."
4.00,"The clinical plaque control crest toothpaste left my teeth clean and fresh after each brush for what seemed to be much longer than other competitor brands."
5.00,"I can tell a difference. No icky taste like other mouthwashes and whitening is a plus! Will buy again."
5.00,"I really love it kept my breathe alot fresher then average toothe paste.the clean is remarkable I won't go to another product I will purchase it from now on crest is the only brand I trust for myself and my children.. THANK YOU CREST"
5.00,"This is great toothpaste. It leaves my mouth feeling clean and fresh. Hopefully I'll spend less time with the hygienist next time with the plaque control."
5.00,"We have found our new mouth wash! It leaves our mouths feeling clean and refreshed!"
5.00,"I love how this rinse makes your mouth feel fresh and clean like you just left the dentist!"
4.00,"my teeth felt clean and looked brighter, and I love that there was no burning sensation while rinsing..."
4.00,"Started using right after getting my teeth cleaned at the dentist and so far so good! Good taste...refreshing"
5.00,"since it's toothpaste, I don't know what else to say. They arrived on-time and in tact. I bought via the subscribe program because I could save money and don't have to go the grocery store after work."
5.00,"THIS TOOTHPASTE MADE ME FEEL LIKE I JUST LEFT THE DENTISTS OFFICE WHOA"
5.00,"i keep reading all the negative reviews on this toothpaste, and i find these reviews appalling. This toothpaste is getting a bad rep for no good reason... I've been using this toothpaste now for over a year along with my Sonicare toothbrush and i think it is the most amazing toothpaste i've ever used. After brushing, my mouth feels smooth & minty clean. I read a reviewer's complaint that this paste leaves a slimy, mucus like film in the mouth???? i really don't understand that statement, because i just don't see that \"film\" in my mouth after i use it. This toothpaste is all i use. i even bought three 5.8 oz tubes of it to have as a spare just in case Crest decides to stop making this product. I highly recommend this toothpaste. It is truly amazing."
4.00,"I really enjoyed using the Crest Pro-Health line. The toothpaste has a nice smell and texture and made my teeth feel really clean without much effort. The clean lasted a long time too. I am very pleased and will be purchasing again!"
4.00,"I really like this oral rinse your mouth really felt clean and fresh."
3.00,"I bought this b/c I've used Crest for years and have preferred the gels. Thought this sounded like something I'd like. The gel is okay, but I haven't really noticed that it's much different than previous products. The packaging is the worst!!! Flip cap won't stay down, gel oozes out of the tube no matter what I've tried, and it's almost impossible to squeeze from the bottom. PLEASE, Crest - Can't you put a screw cap on this?"
5.00,"I love this toothpaste. My teeth feel clean for hours after brushing. I love the whole experience!"
3.00,"I am not big on minty toothpaste, so this is a bit strong for me. It works well though and kept me feeling fresh."
5.00,"I used the Crest Pro Health family of products and they clean much better than I expected. They really made my mouth feel clean and fresh. Definitely recommended to all!"
4.00,"Both my husband and I loved it! Would definitely buy it again."
5.00,"I have used Crest since I was a child and the Pro Health is the best for making your teeth their cleanest. You have the clean feeling for hours after brushing. I drink alot of coffee and can see some of the stains are defintely lighter. Thanks again P&G for another great product"
4.00,"i liked this product, was not too harsh on teeth and gums like some others can be yet helped keep my teeth white."
2.00,"This is not the first time I've disliked a Pro-Health product. But it's been a while since that first entry by Crest, so I figured it was worth a shot. And it is better, but not by a lot. I'm not sure what the \"smoother formulation\" for folks over 50 is actually all about. It's a bit thicker and stays put on the brush. That's nice, but it's the only thing I liked. The packaging is fine; no problems there. The only active ingredient is stannous flouride, which can stain teeth. The package notes state this and indicates that \"this Crest is specially formulated to help prevent staining.\" Why not use something else like other toothpastes do? Personally, I'd rather not risk any staining from my toothpaste. I want it to help remove stains and whiten my teeth. The tube lists several benefits regarding preventing gingivitis. In fact, it claims that it's a toothpaste for anti-gingivitis. Then why not include an active ingredient for that? This toothpaste helps only in the way that any toothpaste helps, by brushing your teeth with it. Nothing special. The Colgate I'm currently using has Triclosan for preventing gingivitis. Sensitivity.... I only use a toothpaste for sensitivity if absolutely necessary; I find they taste off and leave an unpleasant taste in my mouth. I'd just as soon use baking soda or swish around salt water. Cheaper, too. And then there's the taste. Others have liked it. I hate it. I want my mouth to feel clean and my breath fresh after brushing. To me, Crest Pro-Health for Life tastes like old bubblegum. Gross. I actually WANT to use Listerine afterwards to get the toothpaste's taste out of my mouth. Thanks, but no thanks. I'm giving it two stars simply because it's better than the first Pro-Health I tried, which had me avoiding any Pro-Health product for years. I will never use this one again, no matter hold old I get."
5.00,"My husband is a big mouthwash user and this is his favorite yet. He liked the flavor and the way it left his mouth feeling fresh and clean for hours. keep up the good work."
5.00,"This is our family favorite toothpaste (I was never a Crest fan until this one came out) & I got this on Subscribe & Save so the price was ideal for the quantity/size. Unfortunately, I got an email that it's no longer available on Subscribe & Save. Still, it's a great toothpaste & leaves our teeth feeling very clean. I will continue to buy no matter what."
4.00,"Crest comes thru again! My teeth and mouth felt extremely clean all day."
5.00,"Crest is the best out there for ANY oral hygeine products! Will only use their toothpaste & toothbrushes. They work the best (and taste the best) for those of us who have sensitive gums and need the sensitivity products. Won't ever switch from Crest!"
5.00,"My teeth felt very clean after using, & kept that feeling through out the day. Great fresh breath, and prevention too! After using for about a week, I noticed less build-up of that \"Plaque-feeling\" overnight."
5.00,"It feels like i have just left the dentist ever time i use it. It doesn't burn and it doesn't taste bad. overall it's good"
4.00,"I liked the mouthwash. My mouth was minty fresh for hours after use."
5.00,"I absolutely loved this toothpaste! The taste of the toothpaste was great, not to mention it left my mouth feeling so clean!!! I would recommend this to everyone!"
5.00,"I had my teeth cleaned in the 2nd week in April. I vow to keep my teeth even cleaner each time I go in. This is awesome at maintaining my teeth so they feel just like they did when I left the dental office. I trust Crest."
5.00,"Tastes great, makes gums feel good, mouth actually feels clean. Keep breath fresher longer. The only toothpaste my husband will use due to the anti-gingivitis ingredient."
1.00,"this product indeed do cause stains, especially the bottom teeth. I have been wondering why my teeth keep staining right after my dental visits. After I read the reviews on here, I made the connection. You would think a mouthwash in blue color would not cause brown stains... think again. Yes, I do drink tea but not a single drop of coffee though. Even the tea I drink mostly raspberry... not those 100% brown colored tea. This product should be pulled from the market in my opinion since the stains really destroys the purpose of cleaning."
5.00,"My husband and I absolutely love this. Mouth still feels clean in the after waking."
5.00,"This is a great product and one I'll use time and again."
5.00,"I really liked this product because it wasn't harsh tasting and my teeth felt very silky after its use."
1.00,"Yes, the sore tooth feels better, but I can no longer taste food. Not worth the trade off. I want my taste buds back."
5.00,"i love the Pro health tooth paste !! Leaves my teeth feeling very clean and my breath fresh."
1.00,"I had been using Crest Pro-Health Clinical Plaque Control for about a week. I immediately started to get an ulcer in my month. At first, I ignored it, and didn't connect the two. Then, as the days progressed, I started developing more and more ulcers. I had approximately 5 ulcers in my mouth at once after a week's time had passed. The only change I had made was I starting using this toothpaste. I immediately switched to Tom's toothpaste (which my dentist recommended &amp; I HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!) and within a few days, my ulcers went away. The Crest team needs to seriously consider recalling this product. The FDA should not allow stannous flouride to be on the market- the active ingredient. I contacted Crest, but have yet to hear a response from them. A product like this should not be on the market. IT IS NOT SAFE FOR YOU FAMILY. The toothpaste is far too abrasive. I will never but another Crest product again. DO NOT USE THIS TOOTHPASTE."
5.00,"This toothpaste is great for my sensitive teeth and my teeth and mouth felt clean longer than with other toothpastes! I will definitely buy this again!"
3.00,"The whole family loved this!!!! Even my daughter who is really picky."
4.00,"I tried the sensitive variety. I liked how fresh and clean my mouth felt after using it! Not yet sure how much it will affect my sensitivity."
5.00,"My mouth felt so much cleaner with this toothpaste than with the regular ProHealth. I love Crest products, but this is my new favorite."
5.00,"This is a great product. It leaves my mouth feeling very fresh, and when I wake up my mouth seems fresher then normal. Also this doesn't burn like so many mouth washes, and the foaming on the teeth is not as extreme. I realize that the burning and foaming is not a bad thing, but this seems to work just as good without it."
2.00,"So this stuff has the \"better\" form of fluoride (Stannous Fluoride) that also allows that possibility that your teeth might temporarily stain. The taste is a little off from anything that would be considered refreshing...and, the reason it's 2 stars instead of 3 (average) is that the stuff is crunchy. Seriously, who would think that people would clamor to use toothpaste in particles of crunchiness in it? I'm certainly not going to. Besides those factors, for my mouth, my original toothpaste is a better toothpaste for flavor, breath stays fresher longer, mouth feeling clean and refreshed, and it keeps the slimy feeling off my teeth for longer. Wouldn't recommend this stuff...Crest has plenty of other average toothpastes that are better than this, but as of now, I'm sticking with Tom's of Maine."
4.00,"I've been using Crest toothpaste on and off since I was a young boy in the mid-1950s. So there should be little doubt that I am definitely in the target-group for their recent product Crest Pro-Health For Life (Selected for ages 50+). According to Procter & Gambles' advertising on the package, this product \"Defends against dental conditions people over 50 experience.\" Of course, I wanted to know exactly what those conditions were. In various places on the packaging Procter & Gamble, the company that manufactures Crest toothpaste, included all of the oral problems its \"Pro-Health\" toothpaste combats and corrects: Cavities, gingivitis, plaque, weak enamel, tartar, surface stains (includes a whitener), tender, inflamed gums, tooth sensitivity, fluoride and freshens breath, too. Quite an impressive list I must admit. However, I still wasn't sure why Procter & Gamble pinpointed the 50+ aged adults for this particular product? It would seem to me that most adults experience these oral needs at one time or another. So, why is Crest marketing this toothpaste to this select group? It wasn't until I spotted the following printed in powder-blue lettering next to a daub of the tooth gel: \"SMOOTH MINT.\" Ah ha! Notice that they didn't just say \"mint\" or \"minty flavor.\" What immediately jumped out at me was the word \"SMOOTH.\" Evidently, Crest customers have let Procter & Gamble know that those in the 50+ age range don't like dry, gritty and abrasive toothpaste. The following is printed on the box indicating why they produced this toothpaste for people over 50: \"All Crest� PRO-HEALTH� adult toothpastes protect against plaque, gingivitis, and sensitivity. This toothpaste was selected for people over 50 because it has a smoother formulation.\" So far I have referred to this produce as \"toothpaste,\" even though I don't consider it either a paste or a gel. It's something in between. But since the box lists it as a toothpaste, I'll do the same. I've been using this Pro-Health For Life (50+) toothpaste for a number of weeks now and I like it. It is very SMOOTH (especially when compared to that gritty polish the hygienist uses at the dentist's office), it's minty flavor leaves my mouth tasting fresh and feeling clean. Yet I will probably need to use it for an extended period of time before I can comment on whether it prevents or combats the other oral problems that Procter & Gamble claims it will, like tooth decay, gingivitis, sensitivity, tartar, etc., etc. The Crest toothpaste I have is a 6 oz tube. I can't say for sure whether this 50+ toothpaste also comes in a larger tube or not. The 6 oz tube should be enough right now to determine whether it really matters if I use the 50+ toothpaste or any of the other Crest toothpastes. One thing I do want to pass on to the reader at this point is regarding the SMOOTH texture. This toothpaste is so SMOOTH that when the cap is removed and the tube is turned cap-side down, the toothpaste virtually oozes out of the tube by sheer gravity; no squeezing necessary. Now that may sound like a great idea, but one better have their toothbrush underneath the tube nozzle first or the paste will be coating the bottom of the sink rather than the toothbrush. Also, the gel is so SMOOTH that is has a tendency to ooze right over the top of the toothbrush, down the side and...you guest it...right into the the sink (No need to despair, though, because I think everyone knows the 3-second rule is always in affect concerning toothpaste!). Before I wrap up this product review, I'd like to point out a couple of things in small print from the back of the package that few people bother to read. WARNINGS: \"When using this product, do not use for sensitivity longer than four weeks unless recommended by a dentist.\" DIRECTIONS: \"Use by adults and children 12 years and older (?). Do not swallow.\" (The following quote is from the side of the toothpaste box: \"Product designed for the adult stage of life.\"). SURFACE STAINING: \"Products containing stannous floride may produce surface staining of the teeth. Adequate toothbrusing (sic) may prevent these stains which are not harmful or permanent and may be removed by your dentist. This Crest is specifically formulated to help prevent staining.\" (Huh?)(I'm sorry, but it doesn't seem sensible to include an active ingredient that may cause staining and then have to add something to shield against staining. Furthermore, this also doesn't sound like the teeth whitening benefit they promised on the front of the box to me.) As I mentioned earlier, I do like this toothpaste. Whether it is really needed for the designated age group or not, is still up in the air as far as I am concerned. Procter & Gamble has a lot of good products, so do they really need to produce another product so similar to the others in this product line? Of course, there is the SMOOTHER formulation to consider when answering this question. Post Script: After posting my product review I took a look at the other reviews of this product. There were so many differences and contradictions from one reviewer to another that it made me wondered if we all actually sampled the same product."
5.00,"Love it. My teeth feel so clean after brushing - it really feels like they've been scrubbed."
4.00,"i just returned from my dental hygienist for a six month cleaning and she told me there's no guaranteed way of eliminating gingivitis, that brushing with the gum protecting toothpaste probably kills more bacteria--and if that's all to be expected, then it's not bad. she said what all dental hygienists say: brush twice a day and floss and use a mouthwash, a regimen i follow. mint is a common flavor in toothpastes; the mint in this brand isn't overwhelming. let me put it this way, i will continue brushing my teeth and when i shop for new tubes, if i see this brand i have no reason to avoid buying it."
4.00,"My teeth very felt clean, the flavor was minty and cool."
5.00,"Okay I have been using this product for six months now. When I went to the dentist for my six month checkup and cleaning my dentist said \"Whatever you have been doing keep it up your gums and teeth look great.\" I have never heard these words from my dentist before. I think I will keep using Crest Pro-health. Oh and by the way the smooth mint is very nice, not too strong or too weak."
4.00,"I've been looking for a good mouthwash and this would be it if I could afford to buy it all the time. Great product with high price."
5.00,"this is so much better than listerine whitening. great results"
4.00,"I love the way my mouth feels after rinsing with this. Have not yet been to the dentist - hope there are good results there too!"
5.00,"This toothpaste is great. My teeth felt really clean. My husband also loved it!"
5.00,"I love this stuff. For years I refused to use mouthwash because it burned my mouth. Now with Crest it does not burn at all and I use it all the time. Does what it says and leaves my mouth feeling nice and fresh."
5.00,"I just won't provide my opinion but what the dental hygienist said during my last dental cleaning. \"Your home healthcare is excellent\". Good results with no side effects."
5.00,"i really liked this toothpaste...i felt like it cleaned well...will purchase again!"
4.00,"My dentist recommended this to me and I love it! My teeth feel like I just got back from a cleaning after using this!"
4.00,"I do not love the mint taste of the toothpaste but can say that my teeth feel pretty clean after using the crest pro health. My teenage daughter loves this brand of toothpaste and will not use another kind."
2.00,"I began to suspect today that switching to this toothpaste last week may be the reason for my swollen, irritated lips. I found these reviews after searching to see if others had any problems. Wow, I cant believe it. Now I am sure and Im getting new toothpaste tomorrow. Disappointed because I hoped this would be a good thing for me."
5.00,"I love this toothpaste; feels like I'm doing something really healthy for my teeth and gums."
5.00,"I love this toothpaste. Makes your mouth feel extra-clean. I wish the company hadn't discontinued making the nighttime toothpaste. Hard to find."
5.00,"I really found pro-health toothpaste to be a great product. It lived up to the Crest name and my expectations of it."
5.00,"My dentist turned me on to this, it reminds me of the polishing compound he uses, complete with those groovy abrasives. Problem is, in a small town of limited choices, this disappeared from all shelves some time ago. Like retailers always say, \"No, but we can order it for you...\" I am so sure. Thank goodness for Amazon."
3.00,"I don't like this stuff. It isn't the flavor or the cleanliness of my teeth after using it. It works as any toothpaste should. What I don't like is the heat. When I brush my teeth I want it to cool my mouth, this stuff feels almost physically warm, it is not too spicy, it feels hot."
5.00,"Excellent product, cool flavor, made my mouth feel fresh and clean!"
5.00,"After using this product my mouth felt so fresh and clean. I enjoy using this product."
4.00,"I used the sample I was sent. I would like to try it for a longer time to see if I would really notice a reduction in plaque. It was kind of a foamy toothpaste, but the taste was pretty good."
5.00,"This is the best mouth wash I've ever tried. It leaves my mouth feeling fresh and my teeth feeling clean and white. I don't generally use mouthwash, but with this one I've been more consistent on my use."
5.00,"It makes my mouth feel like I am taking the best care I can of it. My teeth stayed cleaner and brighter longer."
2.00,"For some reason Crest is not my preferred toothpaste. I think because it doesn't foam enough."
5.00,"The toothpaste was great. It really makes the teeth white. Would recommend this product!"
4.00,"My teeth felt clean and fresh after using this product."
4.00,"This did a great job giving me the just from the dentist clean feeling. I felt fresh and was confident after using it."
5.00,"I always feel so fresh and clean after I use this product. I feel like it cleans better than most other products I've used."
5.00,"This made my teeth feel so clean! I love it! I will continue to use this toothpaste."
1.00,"I used CrestPro-Health (Clinical Gum Protection ) for the first time this morning. I immediately had an intense burning sensation in the right side of my cheek. With in 10 ten minutes I had a large blister form in the right side of my cheek. Several hours into my work day, I could not move my neck to the right side. I felt a huge lump under my right ear, and the right side of my face was swollen, hot and red. Thank god I work in a medical facility which administers Chemotherapy and knows how to handle reactions. I went to my nurse manager,who then went and got our Physician Assistant and Head Pharmacist. I told them about using the Crest Pro-Health this morning. I was immediately given 50mg of Benadryl and Prednison. They all agreed I was having a severe reaction to the Crest-Pro-Health. I was repeatably asked if I was having trouble breathing. I remained calm but I was terrified. Later one of the nurses printed off your reviews for me. I guess I'm not alone. Why is this product still on the market? I use different tooth pastes all the time, I have never experienced anything like this . I am so glad I was at work when this happened.                                              Terrifying experience."
5.00,"This is my absolute favorite toothpaste! It taste great and it feels clean for hours!"
5.00,"I used to use another product with similar qualities, and this product was just as good and more affordable."
1.00,"I believe that the crest pro-health multi-protection clean mint rinse created yellowish brown stains on my teeth. I just returned home from a dental visit to have stains (developed since my purchase) removed. I couldn't tell where the stains were coming from until I read some of the other comments on this page. I love Crest tooth paste, it works well but from now on I'll just stick to Listerine mouth wash."
5.00,"My husband has been using it for a week and loves the results. He was having gingivitis issues and this product has helped him."
3.00,"another great product from crest but not sure it is worth the extra money"
4.00,"Very good Quality product. Price is high for everyday use. Hope price to align with Listerine."
5.00,"This mouthwash left my mouth feeling fresh and clean. My whole family really liked it and I will be buying it again."
5.00,"OMG!!! I FEEL GREAT USING THIS PRODUCT, LOVE IT LOVEIT. THANKS!!!"
3.00,"This mouthwash works really well. I will buy it again."
5.00,"LOVE this toothpaste!!! You could really tell a difference in the morning compared to using a regular toothpaste. VERY DISAPPOINTED that Crest chose to discontinue it. Greatly hoping they change their minds...."
5.00,"I really liked the way my teeth felt so clean. I would tell all my friends to about this product."
4.00,"My mouth feels so clean and fresh. I floss, but im always looking for extra boosters to help with plaq"
4.00,"It really tasted great and made teeth feel fresh and clean. It was a good value for the money."
4.00,"I was impressed with this brand of Crest toothpaste. I am a Colgate user so I may be switching brands."
5.00,"I've always loved the Crest brand of tooth paste and the pro-health formula did not disappoint. I definitely recommend everyone to try it!"
5.00,"have been using this toothpaste for about a week and have to say I am very pleased with this product. It really helps with the gums, family is also loving the product. I would recommend this product to anyone having problems with their gums, such as bleeding or inflammation. This product really helps and in a very quick time."
1.00,"It's the strangest sensation I've ever had. After using this product according to the directions printed on the label, I lost all ability to taste for at least 18 hours. I used this product at bedtime and wasn't able to taste anything until dinner the following day. Just to be sure, I used it again last night and sure enough, I can't taste anything today.Other similar Crest products have proven to cause brown staining on the teeth and loss of the sense of taste. Add that warning to this product, too!"
5.00,"Love the way my teeth feel after using this product!"
5.00,"I love Crest Pro-Health Clinical Rinse. It's a regular part of my tooth routine, morning and evening. My mouth doesn't feel as fresh and clean when I forget to use it. I don't know if I can credit Pro-Health products completely, but since I started using them a few years ago I finally stopped having new cavities!"
3.00,"good but not my favorite i don't like the taste more than every other"
1.00,"I used this product and have had mouth ulcers and numbness on the right side of my mouth since using it. I googled this product and found I was not alone with an allergic reaction to this toothpaste. Please do not use this product. If you do chose to use it and have symptoms be sure to stop using and see if symptoms improve. Also if you have symptoms after using be sure to contact Proctor and Gamble. They need, at the least, to put a warning on this product!"
1.00,"Used for a week. My tongue burns and is numb. My gums are sore. I have a sore throat. My daughter's gums bled profusely. My lips are raw. Never thought it was the toothpaste until right after I brushed last night, the pain from my tongue made me cringe it hurts so much. So I went on-line to find that many other are having the same problems as I."
5.00,"I really like this toothpaste. I have always been a Crest toothpaste fan."
4.00,"The Crest Pro Health toothpaste did help my teeth feeling clean after my dentist check-up. I do believe that it also helped my teeth stay whiter but not quite as much as I was hoping but overall I liked the toothpaste alot and will buy again"
1.00,"After using Crest Pro-Health Clinical three times in the past two days, I am completely disgusted and in a BUNCH of pain. The tip of my tongue has developed painful blisters with a numb/tingling sensation, along with swelling. I have sores all over my gums, on the insides of my cheeks, and swollen lips with cankers sores. After using the product I also noticed a white substance (which I was told was dead gum tissue) coming off of my gums. I believe that I have received a chemical burn from this mouthwash. From my research of this product, I see that the common census of this product is that it is worthless, as these sort of symptoms have happened to an uncountable number of people. How horrible of P&G to keep something on the shelves that is known for its miserable side effects!! I know that I will stay away from any P&G products from now on. The amount of unnecessary pain that this company has brought on to its customers with this product is not excusable. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!"
4.00,"This is Crest plus, with some kind of tingly-feeling bursts (think pop-rocks candy) as you brush, along with somewhat gritty paste. I've used Crest for years almost exclusively, and this one seems to have extra whitening properties. Though there is definite grit included, the high level of mint leaves me with a very fresh, sparkling clean feeling, though it is a little sugary for my taste. The mint is monumental.The reason for not giving it five stars is two-fold.One - the cap. Instead of the old screw-on variety, the cap is a fold up type, which might work well except for:Two - the consistency. This toothpaste has a different viscosity from 'ordinary' Crest toothpastes that places it somewhere between a gel, silly putty, and melted cheese. The best way to describe it is that it is somewhat stringy, and does not clear the tip well after putting it on your toothbrush. You have to either wipe off the tip of the tube after each use or face gobs of toothpaste drizzling out and filling the flip cap, eventually running down the outside like blue lava. So, the effect is unappealing. If you're not sharing a tube and don't care or if you're a middle of the tube squeezer sort of person, this may not bother you. For me sharing a tube of toothpaste with a spouse, when it has dripped and gooed up the dispenser part is kinda yucky. If you're going to carefully wipe it after each use, or clean the lid every other day or so, the product is worth the trouble.In short, I really like this toothpaste. Not so much the distribution method."
5.00,"My visits to a dentist office are infrequent, after using this product my teeth felt like I had just visited a dentist. Excellent product made me feel confident and I kept looking at my teeth in the mirror."
1.00,"I had been using but later, when comparing the efficacy of Listerine v. Crest Pro-Health, I found some dental discussion boards and more than a few reviews which alleged that the blue mouthwash stained people's teeth. P&G even admits it, thus you'll find a warning to this effect on the rear label of every bottle of Crest Pro-Health no matter the tint of the mouthwash (yes, even the clear mouthwash contains this warning). I immediately dumped the remainder down the sink even though I hadn't experienced such negative results (yet). I didn't want to risk getting blue teeth. I took a chance on this product because I bought into the advertisement stating that it is the most effective way to keep a clean mouth months after a dental cleaning. The mouthwash is clear - so, no problem, right? The taste isn't all that pleasant, but I attribute that more to the hydrogen peroxide than anything. I figured that if the product worked well in keeping my teeth clean then I could eventually get accustomed to the taste. Unlike other reviewers, I never experienced any swollen glands, but I can't speak to whether or not I experienced loss of taste because I only used this product in the evening right before bed. What I can say, though, is that after using the product every evening for the past month or so, I have noticed dark stains between the gaps of my teeth. It looks as if my teeth are rotting! This seems odd for someone like myself who flosses every day, brushes twice a day and uses two types of mouthwash. The only rationale points back to the warning label (again) on every bottle of Crest Pro-Health. Do a simple Google search and see for yourself the number of complaints related to the Pro-Health mouthwashes and tooth staining."
5.00,"I really love using Crest ProHealth products. I feel like I'm doing something good for my mouth and my health when I use any of the products, but especially the tooth paste."
1.00,"I recently had my wisdom teeth removed, and after a week my dentist told me to start rinsing with half-water, half-mouthwash.  Typically, I use Listerine--I know it's pretty harsh for most people, but I've always kind of liked it.  However, this time around I figured maybe that burning sensation wouldn't be such a good idea on tender gums, so I tried this stuff.                                                                     The aftertaste immediately turned me off.  It has that same sort of clinging-to-the-back-of-your-mouth stickiness that Scope does, but I decided to stick with it.  There are worse things I've had to deal with.  But THEN I started having issues with a strange sort of numbness on my tongue.  It's hard to describe.  It was JUST on the other side of being a burning sensation, as though I'd spread benzocaine all over it.  Worse, I realized I couldn't taste anything.  For several days, I chalked it up to that 'weird taste' people describe when their tooth extraction sites are healing, despite the fact that I've been staying right on top of my oral hygiene.  But there was still a nagging suspicion that the mouthwash was to blame, and sure enough, after a quick online search I discovered there are a TON of people who've had adverse reactions to the stuff.                                                                     Researching mouthwash is not one of those things I would have ever thought to do.  It seems pretty straightforward: you swish it around your mouth for a bit, spit it out, good to go.  I never would have thought something that is THIS consistently bad would still be on the market, but here it is!  Luckily, I didn't experience the tooth staining, but losing my sense of taste for several days was quite enough.  Count this as one more reason why I hate Crest!"
5.00,"Made my mouth feel scrubbed clean, fresh,and whitened!"
5.00,"I don't know how this great stuff could cause all the problems the negative reviewers have claimed, I've been using it since it first came out, I'm almost done with my 3rd tube, and I have zero complaints.  I think this stuff is wonderful, I started using it cuz my dentist told me my gums are beginning to recede. Since I've been on this stuff he now doesn't remember why he told me that.  He says my gums are great.  I would recommend this product to anyone, I'm still using it for maintenance, its great stuff."
5.00,"I loved this mouthwash. It left my mouth feeling very clean, but it did not take my breath away as most mouth washes seem to do."
5.00,"This Crest toothpaste is awesome! Great taste that leaves your month feeling like you've just had a professional cleaning done. It's the new favorite of my family's and is preferred over all the rest."
5.00,"I am a lifelong, never had a cavity, user of Crest. The fact that theyy continue to improve their quality lets my children enjoy the same benefits I did when I was growing up. I appreciate a product that has committed to quality and when it does change it is always for the better."
4.00,"I thought this toothpaste was great, it has great flavor & makes my teeth feel extra clean :)"
3.00,"My mouth feels clean and fresh after using this product."
4.00,"I love this toothbrush! I have the Oral-B Pro-Health all in one with crossaction bristles toothbrush in medium. It cleans my teeth amazingly well. It says it has 7 benefits. They are: 1. Removes hard to reach plaque. 2. Reduces gingivitis. 3. Cleans along the gumline. 4. Polishes away surface stains. 5. Removes odor causing germs on tongue. 6. Stimulates gums. 7. Gentle on enamel and gums. I will testify that my teeth felt clean all day after using this toothbrush. The toothpaste - Crest Pro-Health - is why I'm not giving this 5 stars. It's gritty and not something I'm used to. It doesn't foam like other toothpastes which is great but it also makes you wonder if you got enough on your toothbrush. The flavor is cool peppermint and it was pleasant. The mouthwash is, for me, like any other mouthwash. It makes my mouth burn and I can't use it for the duration it requests, 30 seconds. The dental floss is one of my favorite flosses. It's flavor is nice and minty. It's called cool mint. The floss is more like a flat ribbon rather than a string like some flosses are which enable it to glide between your teeth easier."
4.00,"Left my teeth feeling awesome! I would buy this product again and would suggest others give it a try."
4.00,"It works good. I like the peppermint taste and my teeth feel clean. I like the consistency of the past also."
4.00,"I was very impressed with the clean feeling of my teeth and tongue. The clean feeling lasted a long time unlike some of the other brands that i have used."
2.00,"The crystals that are in it are really annoying. The taste is really sweet, it seems that you are brushing with sugar. It does not give a clean feeling."
4.00,"The floss is strong, the taste is minty. It does a great job."
1.00,"Add me to the list of people who get canker sores from this stuff. I'm prone to getting them (I'll also get them if I bite my lip/cheek/tongue or if I chew Big Red gum) while my wife is not. She bought this toothpaste and hasn't had any problems. I used it on two occasions about ten days apart (right after my first set of canker sores healed) and got two or three sores almost immediately both times. It's supposed to be good for your gums but it damages (what seems to be) about half of the reviewers' gums instead...                                                                     It's not worth the risk!"
4.00,"As a mouth rinse, it is pretty good. It cleans and leaves your mouth fresh. However, I do not like the amount of hydrogen peroxide in it. I really hate the feel of peroxide in my mouth, so this is not a product for me. If you have not objections to that peroxide feel and taste, then it is a great mouth rinse."
1.00,"I have very sensitive teeth and was using Aquafresh for Sensitive teeth for years with great results. Lately you can't find that brand in stores and I had run out. I bought what I thought was the Crest equivalent. Not even close. The Crest is now in the trash and I've ordered a supply of Aquafresh on-line. The longer I used the Crest, the more sensitive my teeth became. I didn't realize what was happening at first, actually not until I noticed I was having trouble with cold drinks, then hot soups, and after 6 weeks it hurt to chew. That's when I took a close look at the Crest label and compared it to Aquafresh. No wonder I was hurting!!!! The active ingredient in Aquafresh, potassium nitrate, was missing from Crest. Crest's active ingredient was fluoride--that's it, nothing for sensitivity. What a rip off! I probably should mention that it tastes awful, leaves an awful tasting yuck in your mouth, and is so gooey that the cap won't close after a few uses so the goo spreads to wherever you set it down. Plus it's twice the price of Aquafresh for Sensitive. I find nothing about this product to recommend. It's really awful."
5.00,"I got a sample of this toothpaste at the dentist office. I love fresh feeling after toothpaste. Teeth feel polished and breath have freshly mint smell. Very refreshing, cleans greatly, keeps teeth smooth and shiny. I want to brush more often with a toothpaste like that. Awesome freshness!"
5.00,"It's practically the only thing I get. I had to stock up on it before I spent a year in England because I was not sure they'd have this brand there. Sure enough, they didn't for the first several months I was there, but right when I was ready to leave they go it in and I bought before I came back home to the States. Makes my teeth feel fresh, clean and helps with the gums and sensitivity I have."
4.00,"While I was impressed with the product's claims I wasn't a fan of the taste. That being said, my husband really likes it & has been using it daily. I would encourage anyone to give it a try ~ anything someone can do to improve his/her oral health is good. :)"
4.00,"This is probably one of the best mouthwashes I've ever used. My mouth feels fresh even after my morning coffee. Will def purchase again when I can get a good deal."
5.00,"Good toothpaste, doesn't burn my mouth like some brands."
4.00,"It taste good and leaves clean feeling and is not to strong."
4.00,"Just like Crest Pro Health, Crest Pro Health Clinical Mouthwash is the best out there! It doesn't have that strong alcohol taste, so it would work great for kids and adults. Plus, it won't leave a strong taste in your mouth lingering for several hours after use. The flavor, clean mint, is like a mint explosion in your mouth that is refreshing while providing good hygeine. It will freshen up your mouth. Definately recommend this product and this brand!!!"
5.00,"Been using the TP for 5 years and love how it cleans and the taste is good too. It is hard to find so I am glad Amazon has this product."
5.00,"Excellent product - really helps control plaque - will buy again"
4.00,"I love the clean fresh feeling that I get from using the Crest Health toothpaste. The clean fresh feeling is long lasting and makes my teeth feel smooth and clean all day."
5.00,"I tried the Clinical formula of the mouthwash and love how it doesn't burn and leaves my mouth feeling fresh and clean. I am totally hooked and will NEVER buy another brand again! Crest rocks when it comes to oral health. I'm off to get the floss and a new toothbrush this weekend!"
5.00,"Crest Pro-Health has been a trusted brand for me. I use this in conjunction with the Crest Pro-Health mouthwash. I have yet to experience anything negative with this product."
4.00,"The entire line of Crest Pro-Health products are great, but the Clinical Plaque Control toothpaste is among the best. It does a terrific job cleaning my teeth, freshening my breath and helping me maintain a healthy mouth."
4.00,"Great to have a toothpaste that does so many things!"
5.00,"I really loved how this cleaned my teeth. It felt like a dentist clean after brushing. Taste was great, I just wish it came in a bigger tube."
5.00,"Left my teeth with a great clean feeling like I just came from the dentist!"
5.00,"I have had plaque and periodontal issues in the past, so I see my hygienist four times a year to ensure that everything is in order. I used a tube of Crest Pro-Health toothpaste and she asked me if I'd been doing something different! She was very pleased with my oral health and told me to keep up the good work. I'm a convert!"
4.00,"It left my mouth feeling the cleanest it's every felt from just a toothpaste alone. Thanks for a great product."
5.00,"This is the first mouthwash I have ever had that tastes OK, and I like to use. I often use it for additional freshness before bedtime and durig the day."
5.00,"This rinse was terrific. After brushing, you want to make sure you've gotten all the gunk off of your teeth...after using the rinse I was confident I had the cleanest mouth in the house!"
2.00,"I bought the crest mouthwash and was not to impressed by it. every time i use it its just a yucky feeling in my mouth. a very gross foamish type feeling. i have to rinse it out quite a bit. and it doesn't taste very good. will not buy again."
4.00,"Does what it says is does. Good product for the price."
5.00,"Unlike some other reviewers who had issues - i love this product and have had no issues with my teeth, gums, or the lining of my mouth; and i have very sensitive teeth and gums. I recommend trying the product for yourself and coming to your own conclusions.  I just bought 6 tubes because i can't get enough of it - go figure. My teeth have become less sensative and my teeth and gums feel healthier since i started using this product.  I have even started to brush 3 times a day because i actually enjoy the result."
5.00,"Enjoyed the flavor and the way it made my teeth feel after brushing."
5.00,"this toothpaste works wonderful. it whitens very quickly and tastes great. its also not very expensive which i love! i would definately recommend this toothpaste."
5.00,"I love the Crest ProHealth line...talk about feeling and being clean!"
1.00,"I bought this product from my local grocery store. My mouth felt very dry the first time I used it. Then I noticed skin inside my mouth began to peel off. I did a quick research online and realized that it is a common problem. I can't believe with all the people who had problems with this product, it is still being sold without any warnings. I am definitely not going try any other Crest products."
5.00,"THIS TOOTHPASTE BLEW ME AWAY!!!IT DID EXACTLY WHAT IT SAID IT WOULD DO. MY TEETH LOOK A HUNDRED TIMES BETTER AND IT TASTES GREAT TOO. 5 STARS!!"
5.00,"This toothpaste left my mouth feeling clean and fresh. My children actually started asking to use it instead of their regular toothpaste!"
5.00,"Loved it! It is hard for me to find a product that leaves my breath fresh for long but this toothpaste did!"
3.00,"I have no complaints about this product. It works just as well as my usual mouthwash. I did not feel like it changed the appearance or feel of my teeth in any way."
5.00,"I often switch brands/flavors just to give new ones a try. I like that Crest Pro Health helps fight plaque against the gumline, plus helps in many other ways as well."
5.00,"This is a nice set that would work well as a care-package for someone away at school. It includes mouthwash, toothpaste, floss, and a toothbrush. The toothbrush is the same kind that my dentist gives out, so I've used these ones quite a bit and like the different bristles that get into all the little spaces of my teeth. The floss is a standard easy-glide. The mouthwash has some sting/burn to it despite being alcohol free; however, it goes away fairly quickly so that my mouth just felt fresh--I didn't feel I needed to rinse with water. The toothpaste doesn't have the bite that some mint toothpastes do, but does have a grittiness that I felt was similar to the polish used at a dental office."
3.00,"This is a great product. Leaves your teeth feeling fresh."
5.00,"Love the Crest Clinical mouthwash. Great flavor and my mouth feels fresh for hours. Highly recommend this product to all, even my husband uses it and he isn't a mouthwash type of person!"
1.00,"I began to look for things in my diet that might be causing the lining of my mouth to slough and was about to stop drinking my favorite tea when an Internet search helped me determine that it was my new toothpaste that was causing the problem.  CREST Pro-Health, Sensitive plus Enamel shield was causing swelling of the lips and sloughing of the lining of the mouth.  Having seen multiple similar accounts of bad reactions to this product, I'm wondering why it has not been taken off the market?  Also, to my horror, all complaints pages on the Internet are accompanied by ads for the offending product!  DUH?!  AND...the packaging does not include a complete list of ingredients...is that legal?  My next move is to contact the FDA."
4.00,"This product was GREAT! It left my mouth feeling fresh and my teeth feeling clean. And best of all it didn't burn my mouth! Great taste too!"
5.00,"Has a clean refreshing taste and aroma. The texture is smooth, almost like satin. My teeth felt clean, refreshed, and smooth."
4.00,"I was very impressed with this toothpaste. Not only did I feel like my teeth were extremely clean after brushing, but they remained clean-feeling even through my morning coffee. I highly recommend this brand, although I feel that their retail prices tend to be high."
5.00,"I LOVE Crest Pro Health Clinical Plaque Control Toothpaste. It left my teeth squeaky clean and so fresh. It felt as good as a cleaning at the dentists office."
5.00,"PUTTING ALL THE PRODUCTS TOGETHER LEAVES YOUR TEETH AND BREATHE AMAZING. I LIKE TO FEEL MY TEETH WHEN THEY ARE CLEAN AND SMOOTH."
5.00,"This toothpaste is amazing! I thought it tasted great and left my teeth feeling really clean!"
5.00,"Kind of expensive for such a small tube of paste. No minty smell or taste. The dentist said my husband's problemed gums are starting to look pretty good now after 6 mths of use"
4.00,"I was excited to try this product and was not disappointed with the results. What I hate most about mouth wash is the strong alcohol flavor and this product accomplishes the same result without the bad taste."
5.00,"Loved how this made my teeth and mouth feel so fresh and clean."
4.00,"So far this toothpaste has been the best feeling in my gums, it doesn't feel too \"stripping\", its fresh and cleans well but it doesn't tear up your mouth the way the whitening pastes do. I did notice my gums were slightly red when i started using and would bleed in certain areas when flossing and this paste has reduced some redness and also the bleeding in most areas. The only issue and this is more of a personal taste is the \"flavor\" of the toothpaste, I find it to taste like Icy Hot, or Bengay cream, but i have this issue with some types of chewing gums as well. The testure of this paste is between a gel and a the usual white paste. Definitely recommended if you have sensitive gums or redness, it helped me without really thinking i needed the help."
5.00,"Left my mouth feeling very clean and fresh, would highly recommend."
4.00,"It seems to work well, and overall, I really like it. I think it's a good buy and gives high quality results. My only concerns about it are relating to my preference for all natural toothpaste. I do like the clean feeling after brushing, but I have found all natural toothpastes I like as much. It is all in your preference."
4.00,"This is a great product that does not burn your mouth like other ones. It leaves your mouth feeling fresh and clean."
4.00,"I wouldn't pay extra money for it and would probably only buy with a sale and coupon. Fresh taste but nothing different than other mouth rinses."
1.00,"I usually use Listerine and have successfully for years.  Bought this because it was on sale and I have lost my job. I was trying to economize.  Now it will cost me more to remove the brown stains that have developed atop and between my bottom front teeth!  FDA site still does not pull up problem in search so they are evidently not taking this seriously.  Complaints are all over the internet though!  Wish I had known this would happen before using though.  I have never had staining in my life--even when I used to drink lots of coffee and soda (caffeine now makes my heart rate elevate too much).  This is disgusting!  The Crest website claims that this is rare (doesn't seem to be from the volume of complaints that I find online--there are surely many more who have not complained online) and even that this is a good sign of dead bacteria!  What a load!  I used Crest for many years, but this has soured me.  I will not use any of their products now.  Not sure how I am going to get rid of these stains."
4.00,"I really enjoyed this toothpaste. My mouth felt clean and fresh and my breath was great! I would truly recommend this product."
1.00,"Using this stuff along with the mouthwash and began to get white strings of mucous inside mouth. I went on line and found huge numbers of people with the same complaints. Also causes a loss of taste."
5.00,"I loved the crest. It kept my teeth feeling clean and plaque free!!"
4.00,"leaves my mouth feeling fresh and clean. doesn't leave a bad after taste in my mouth like some other \"clinical\" toothpastes."
5.00,"It really cleans your teeth and really love the freshness feeling in my mouth."
5.00,"This toothpaste is amazing! Leaves my mouth and teeth feeling so fresh and clean. Love it!!"
5.00,"I would definitly recommend this product. Crest pro health toothpaste leaves a long lasting clean feeling that I am not getting from my current toothpaste. I find myself asking myself if I actually brushed my teeth! I loved the clean feeling this toothpaste gave me. I was sad when I ran out."
3.00,"I'm not a huge mouth wash afficianado but found this to be an average product."
4.00,"I think it was ok. But my preteen LOVE it! thats all she use and wont to use"
4.00,"My teeth feel so clean after using the pro health. I love that fresh clean feeling. Amazing totally worth it !!"
5.00,"I loved how clean my teeth felt after using. The price was a little high but you do get your money's worth."
2.00,"Bought in bulk so I wouldn't have to buy for a while. They ended up sending product that expired the next month, defeating that purpose."
4.00,"I was expecting this toothpaste to be like all of the others, but it worked beyond my expectations. My teeth felt very clean much longer into the day. I love this toothpaste and will continue to use it!"
5.00,"I have very sensitive gums and because of this, many products irritate them. Not this mouthwash! My mouth felt clean and fresh for hours!! Best part.. NO burning or irritation! Thank you crest!"
5.00,"The mouthwash is very gentle. Doesn't irritate or burn your mouth, like some others. I like how the mouthwash also doesn't leave an aftertaste of mint in my mouth."
5.00,"I have enjoyed using Crest toothpaste for many years and I believe the Pro-Health brand is instrumental in ensuring my continued excellent oral health. I enjoy the minty taste of this toothpaste and although the cap is not a revolutionary invention, the fact that I can stand the tube up on my cabinet (rather than having it prone) frees up much needed counter space and is an added bonus. Regarding the whitening ability, it does lighten surface stains and brightens teeth however if you're looking for true whitening power - you should consider purchasing a teeth whitening kit since they are the most effective in producing pearly white results (these products stay on the tooth enamel longer hence brighter, whiter teeth). This toothpaste however is an excellent supplement to teeth that are already whitened in that the results experienced from your whitening product will last MUCH longer through daily brushing with Crest Whitening Pro Health. Enjoy brushing and remember - this product is for adults and children 12 and older."
5.00,"The Crest ProHealth mouth rinse works as soon as it hits your mouth. You can feel it working while gurgling. It makes my mouth feel fresh and clean without the added sting. It has a nice flavor that doesn't need to be rinsed out afterwards. I would gladly recommend this product."
4.00,"Been using this for about a week and have not experienced what others are saying. Maybe they aren't following the directions and that's altering their experience? The bottle says to rinse out all tooth paste from mouth before use. So maybe some reaction happens if ya don't?? As far as \"losing taste\" idk seems like ANYTIME you eat something after using mouthwash EVERYTHING tastes different."
4.00,"After using this product for over a month and then a visit to the dentist I was excited to find out that this product delivers what it says!! I had a lot less plaque and my mouth was probably in the best shape it has been in."
2.00,"While I'm not entirely disappointed with this mouthwash (the flavor is acceptable, and it certainly leaves me feeling \"minty fresh), it leaves a strange sludge in my mouth -- not unlike the consistency of snot, but an alarming shade of purple. I avoid wasting things whenever possible, so I'm going to use it until it's gone, but I won't buy it again."
5.00,"This toothpaste has all the features that are recommended by my dentist for oral health. It keeps my teeth healthy between visits."
4.00,"An excellent toothpaste from Crest! A fresh clean feeling that lasts for several hours after brushing. The toothpaste tastes great, too!"
4.00,"I tried the Crest Pro-Health Clinical line and was very happy. It left my mouth feeling clean and kept it that way for the whole day. The taste was not gritty or too minty. It was a pleasant mint taste that was smooth. I would recommend."
4.00,"The taste could be better but seems to work great!"
4.00,"The ProHealth toothpaste left my mouth feeling clean and fresh all day. It appeared to help with the plague that can build up on my teeth leaving my teeth looking cleaner and healthier."
5.00,"It leaves my teeth feeling clean like I just left the dentist office :)"
1.00,"I started using this product about 6 weeks ago -- and within a week started experiencing a horrible metallic taste in my mouth continously and food tastes differently. The only thing that helps is sucking on mints. Almost feels like my toungue has been burned. I've stopped using the mouthwash and hope that my taste buds return to normal. Do NOT use this product -- I don't know what chemical they are using, but it will ruin your taste buds and leave a horrible taste in your mouth 24/7!"
3.00,"I tried the Crest Pro-Health toothpaste & feel that it's just another average toothpaste. There was not a significant difference in the way my teeth felt from using any other toothpaste. For that reason, I don't feel the extra expense for this specialty toothpaste is worth it."
5.00,"My husband used this along with the mouthwash and it has helped him with gingivitis issues."
5.00,"This rinse left my mouth feeling clean and fresh. No burning! Loved it."
5.00,"I like the feeling after use. Taste was good. I recommend this product."
1.00,"i would NOT recommend this product. It feels like I'm just rubbing my teeth against baking soda, a powdery feeling. There is no freshness about it even though it states \"fresh clean mint.\" It doesn't leave a clean feeling afterwards. I'm not sure if it's even doing what's advertised on the tube."
3.00,"It worked fine, tasted good but the cost was just too high for toothpaste."
5.00,"I love this toothpaste. It makes my teeth look and feel cleaner and healthier!"
4.00,"I love this mouthwash. It made my teeth feel very clean with no overpowering taste."
5.00,"I love, love, love this toothpaste!! definately my new favorite and my new regular!! My teeth felt so clean!!! Thank you!!!!!"
5.00,"Liked it very much - Crest is a trusted name and this product did not disappoint."
4.00,"I really like this toothpaste and all it has to offer. I have noticed it is a little pricier at the stores than some but its worth the money."
5.00,"This may sound odd, but my whole mouth felt clean, not just my teeth. The clean was good, rinsed clean. My mouth felt fresh and clean. Felt confident talking and not worrying about babd breath because of how clean my mouth was."
4.00,"I thought that this product worked as well as any other toothpaste."
5.00,"I used this toothpaste and it gave me fresh breath for the whole day it seemed. I love this product"
4.00,"The toothpaste left a clean feeling in my mouth. It has a good flavor that lasted instead vanishing in 2 minutes."
5.00,"Absolutely love how cleen my teeth feel after brushing!"
5.00,"It left my mouth clean and taken care of helped my teeth not hurt"
4.00,"After using this toothpaste, my teeth felt so clean almost like I just left the dentist. It's a good quality product and had a nice flavor, however it's not something I would normally buy without using a coupon because it's a little pricey for my family."
4.00,"This toothpaste was a pleasant change to use after using a different brand for a long time. It rinsed out of my mouth easier, and off my toothbrush easier too. The only thing I did not like about it was that it seemed to make my tongue tingle a little unpleasantly for a second."
1.00,"Tastes like someone farted in my mouth and I let it ferment their ~ 1 month. I just picked this up and was getting ready to go out and was like \"ok let's just finishing groomin up with some mouthwash\". Gurgle for 30s. Spit in sink. Than noticed this putrid smell. At first I wondered if I had a small bowel obstruction and was regurgitating fecal matter but realized that can't be the case bc I had a successful (and impressive) bowel movement everyday for last week. I realized it was the mouthwash so tried to dilute it by swishing water around... No luck. Started dry heaving from taste. Finally after 5more minutes of putting my mouth on my kitchen facet taste is down to a baby fart. I hate you crest! My dreams will be haunted by your product tonight. I'm hesitant to throw this product away. I feel like I should burn it and read some sacred passages from some ancient text. It's that bad!"
4.00,"Crest products are good in general and this one did not disappoint!"
5.00,"I absolutely love this toothpaste. I have always used Crest but even I was surprised at the performance of this product."
5.00,"After I brushed my teeth for the first time with NEW Crest Pro-Health Toothpaste my teeth felt amazingly clean, just like the amazing clean feeling you have after a dental cleaning! I love this product and have recommended it to everyone!!"
4.00,"Leaves teeth feeling clean for a long time, great tasting."
4.00,"I recently tried Crest Pro-health clinical toothpaste. Overall I was completely satisfied. The toothpaste did leave my mouth feeling clean all day. The only downside is the price, however a healthy mouth is worth it."
4.00,"This toothpaste left my mouth feeling clean and fresh. I would purchase this toothpaste again."
1.00,"After my deep dental cleaning, I decided to try Crest Pro Health, along with daily flossing and brushing with an electric toothbrush. After five weeks of using Crest Pro Health once a day in the morning with no other changes in my routine, I was growing concerned at the brown stainings that were appearing in between my teeth and near the gum lines and becoming worse. I thought maybe I was grinding my teeth during my sleep, but how could this have happened if I did everything I did before using Crest Pro Health? I decided to research online and was upset at the hundreds of complaints I read with the majority having the same problem I did! From this experience, I am reminded to research, research, research the products I use and consume! I decided to switch to a herbal toothpaste called Auromere (with ingredients I can understand) and am going in for a deep cleaning / whitening again. Sigh, I cannot believe I have to go back to the dentist again and pay the costly treatments over a cheap $8 bottle! I do not understand why P&G have not taken Crest Pro Health off the shelves since first complaints reported five years ago in 2008? In closing, paying more for a reputable product and integrity of the company are important learning lessons for my and your health's sake!"
5.00,"Excellent toothpaste. All Crest products are of the highest quality. This surpassed it with the zing after brushing. Had a toothy smile all day!"
2.00,"I was excited to try this thinking it claimed many great things. After having used it for about a week.. I am very weary of using it anymore. Purple clumps when I spit.. not there when I put it in my mouth so I thought that was weird.. and it also leaves a weird taste in mouth. After looking up online I have found many many people with the same problem. I plan on contacting crest for a refund!"
5.00,"It's a great product. Has a great refreshing taste and keeps my teeth clean."
5.00,"I love the way this toothpaste made my mouth feel!"
5.00,"I'm sold!! This is the best toothpaste I have ever used! My mouth stayed clean feeling for hours...even after drinking soda. It has a great flavor and have recommended it to many."
5.00,"I love love love Crest mouthwash - especially the purple one, it tastes so good. The biggest benefit for me is that it defends against plaque for a looooooong time and I am constantly grazing. I also love that it doesn't burn! Now all I need to do is convert my fiance because he doesn't think it's working unless his mouth is numb lol"
4.00,"I'm not crazy about mouthwash but I tried this one. I'm glad I did. I drink a lot of beverages that stain my teeth. This helped my teeth stay white and the taste was OK. No stinging sensation. I think I'll stick with this one!"
5.00,"I have been a Listerine user for years... in the mornings I use the Listerine Whitening treatment (with peroxide) and at night I use the 6-in-1 purple stuff (that is my name for it). The Crest Pro-Health Rinse can't replace my Listerine Whitening treatment, but it can (and has) replaced my 6-in-1 purple rinse. The Crest Pro-Health Rinse has a nice minty taste that seems to stick with me until morning. Notes- - Nice minty taste with almost no burn - Keeps my mouth nice and fresh for extended time Final Verdict- If you like minty mouthwashes the Crest Pro-Health might be the one for you! 5 Stars"
5.00,"Worked wonderfully in conjunction with the toothpaste to leave my mouth feeling clean and fresh ! Love it !"
4.00,"I do like this paste as it has a pleasant and not overpowering mint flavor. The texture reminds me of a baking-powder toothpaste (although better tasting). But for the life of me I can't figure out why it's for people over 50. My 11yr old grandson is sharing the tube with us with no complaints. Cleans well and doesn't fall off the brush. (An issue with the grandson). I really like this toothpaste and will continue to buy it. I'll let you know if something amazing happens. Oh...just for the record, I've used it on my partial and it works quite well. Thank you. MEF"
5.00,"The bitter taste is normal, first off its part of their night time mouth care system, label says so on the back, don't eat or drink anything for least 30 mins afterward, so if your getting up in the morning, having a coffee after brushing your teeth then well should have read the label.                                              Also, this is the best mouth wash, for going to bed to at night, after you sleep and wake up the breath is much nicer.. Use a different mouth wash for mornings, to avoid the bitter taste, which is the stuff doing its job.  Use tieh the Crest Night time complete toothpaste for best results.                                              Dont hate a product simply cause you don't read the back label :P"
5.00,"Makes your teeth feel like you just came from the dentist."
5.00,"I love the Pro Health line! My teeth feel and look clean and I have fresh breath!"
5.00,"I am usually a different toothpaste user but I tried it because my husband liked it. I have to admit I am hooked it is great - taste great, feels clean and I believe it does help whiten my teeth."
5.00,"Love the minty taste. Leaves my teeth feeling clean and smooth."
1.00,"I bought this cause I thought it would help me get RID of my canker sores that I had on my gums. WRONG. The first time I used it it burned so badly and the next day I ended up with little cankersores (like four) on my tongue that still have not gone away yet (it's been like, a week??) It sucks because eating anything is extremely painful now!!! I WISH I HAD READ THESE REVIEWS BEFORE I BOUGHT THIS STUFF. Obviously I am NOT the only one to experience something like this. Have never had such a bad reaction to mouthwash before!"
5.00,"I bought this because it didn't contain some of the chemicals other toothpastes do. I was almost put off by the comments about it turning teeth brown, it doesn't. It is pleasant to use and does what it says."
5.00,"I don't understand why people are having such a hard time on closing this cap, I've never once had problems with the flip top cap. I simply open it and close it like it was designed to do so. The only problem I have ever had with this toothpaste is the tip where the paste comes out gets all sticky and toothpaste gets all over it. Other than that i like the taste and I like the way my mouth feels after brushing. It's not number one on my list but it is pretty high up there."
5.00,"I was skeptical that yet another tooth paste was going to \"keep my mouth feeling fresher longer\". I was wrong this is a great tasting tooth paste and it indeed does keep working longer than any other brand i have tried."
3.00,"Verdict is still out regarding this product. My son enjoys it but as a parent I will have to see if the dentist agrees."
4.00,"Wonderful but pricey. Might work on the flavor a bit but it definitely was refreshing and worked"
2.00,"I'm not sure why, but this toothpaste seems gritty to me. It's a texture thing that I cannot get over. And, the mint flavoring makes my teeth hurt. I received a sample from Amazon Vine and really tried to like this toothpaste, but it is just not for me."
2.00,"Although I thought the product felt ok initially, it didn't take long until my mouth had that no so fresh feeling...I haven't found a product yet that competes with Colgate Total which is my complete favorite!!"
1.00,"Leaves a bad taste after using it and does not make mouth feel fresh like the other mouthwashes from crest"
5.00,"teeth felt clean all day, it taste good too, cant wait too see how the check up goes at the dentist that will be the sure sign"
5.00,"I have always been a Crest kid. I'm not a kid anymore been still love these products. I was glad to try the Pro Health line for us older \"kids\". I am very pleased with this extension line and will continue using the Crest Pro Health collection. It makes my mouth feel very happy and healthy"
5.00,"I bought this toothpaste from amazon warehouse so its cheap. But its very effective. I noticed that when I used it after few days, my teeth sensitivity was minimized. It works for me."
5.00,"I love this mouth rinse! It leaves a fresh, clean feeling that lasts a long time...and my hygenist noted that I had less plaque!"
5.00,"This is a very good product. It is easy on the mouth and seems to keep my mouth hydrated for quite a long period"
4.00,"--First time user."
5.00,"Loved it! It made my mouth and teeth feel extra clean!It felt like I just had a professional cleaning!"
4.00,"Seems to work well, but the taste is kind of hard to deal with. I guess if it tasted better it would work less!"
4.00,"I really liked this mouthwash. Left my teeth feeling clean! Although it did leave a slight aftertaste to me, but all and all a good product."
1.00,"I have very bad genetic gum disease. I also can not drink alcohol or eat sugar. For a number of years, I have used Biotin's anti Gingivitis mouth rinse. That has now been discontinued (at least in the Pacific Northwest where I live; they now only offer their dry mouth product), leaving us with this Crest product (also sold separately), & and various generics (including my usual, packed as & sold by Kroger). According to my hygienist, the Crest & Kroger are doing just as good of a job as the Biotin was, at a much lower price. My only complaints are I preferred the taste of the Biotin, & the strong Blue food coloring of the Crest requires some effort to wash off of a toilet seat, if one chooses to spit it out in the toilet. As far as the tooth paste, Crest has been my go to brand for years. This one is supposed to be a combo for sensitivity & gingivitis; don't think I've used this specific flavor before. It's also an extra large 6 oz size. The floss is a high quality thick string/tape style. While I prefer the cloth style when one is moving to this quality & price point; my hygienist prefers this style. I use an electric toothbrush, so no real comments there. i am going on a trip soon, & will take this brush along; will try to report back afterwards. Summing up, several other reviewers have mentioned staining & chemical issues; especially with the tooth rinse. As Biotin has been discontinued, this is all there is for someone who can't consume alcohol or sugar.........i.e, I don't wanna know. I can state that I have not experienced any tooth staining personally & have used various Crest toothpastes all my life & have been reluctantly using the tooth rinse (& the equivalent generic) for 6-9 months). I am not discounting that apparently others have experienced it; just saying that I have not. Price could be a factor (either way) but as of today, there is NO PRICE LISTED. Also, as an aside, Amazon sent this with Ontrac; imo currently the best of all the carriers. Edit 7/13/13: I promised an update on the toothbrush. In a nutshell, it's better than most manual toothbrushes, but not even close to the cheapest Crest & Oral B electrics. Edit 7/27/13: They finally posted a price. I have lowered my rating from 4 stars to 1 completely due to the price. Bought separately at a discount store, there's maybe $20 worth of merchandise here."
3.00,"I just couldn't get past the flavor of this line. Tastes like black licorice just not for me..."
5.00,"I began using it after a cleaning at my dentist, and my teeth still feel right from the dentist fresh!"
4.00,"I tried the Crest Pro-Health toothpaste for two weeks. It's a great product and as good as I would expect from Crest. The taste is great but I could tell only a small difference in how clean my teeth felt through out the day. I may try using the whole Pro-Health line next time. I would recommend to everyone."
1.00,"I used this once, and I lost my ability to taste anything right until the next day. I used it only one more time, and I can confirm the taste side effects. It also dried out my mouth and left my tongue rough feeling, like I'd burned it.                                                                     This is a truly frightening product. I hope Crest sees a class action lawsuit over this.                                                                     To those implying that all the negative reviews are shills or lying, do a google search for \"crest prohealth loss of taste.\""
5.00,"This mouthwash is wonderful in that it lingers and keeps your mouth fresh and minty. What a unique product that my family will now use on a regular basis."
3.00,"The peroxide in this product made my mouth feel clean (and disinfected), but DH didn't like the flavor/sensation created by it. Kind of expensive, but it worked fine for me."
1.00,"Please do not buy this product. The cap design and the consistency of the toothpaste make for a mess in your bathroom and a waste of the toothpase. Even if you close the cap the toothpaste leaks and gets wasted. I would hate to think Crest purposly trying to get people to buy more toothpaste sooner. I love Crest toothpaste but refuse to buy Pro Health. It wouldn't get even one star if I had a choice."
5.00,"Looks like Crest Marketing has decided to aim this toothpaste for the over 50 crowd, which is a shame as I think anyone would like this toothpaste - especially anyone with sensitive teeth. It has a mild mint flavor, and for those with sensitive teeth, it's not too abrasive. I liked the flavor and consistency while I was brushing and I liked the results after I finished brushing - my teeth felt clean. We use Crest Pro-Health Clinical Gum Protection formula and I found this toothpaste had a milder mint flavor and a slightly different consistency (The Gum Protection formula is your standard paste, this toothpaste was somewhere between a gel and a paste) which I liked (I'm not a big fan of pastes). I actually prefer this toothpaste to the gum protection formula. Overall a winner and a toothpaste for any age group."
5.00,"I really loved how clean my teeth felt and how much whiter they became. It didn't take long either. I really enjoyed giving this product a try."
5.00,"Unfortunately, more than half the bottle leaked out on the trip home. It smells like great mouth rinse, but, I'll have to wait to find out. I am giving it an excellent rating based on other Crest products I currently use."
5.00,"I love this product. It makes my mouth feel super clean and healthy. I also got a better report from my dentist! The product works great, but it is a little pricy. However, I do feel like I am doing the right thing for my health by spending a little more on this product."
4.00,"My mouth seems to be fresher since using this today"
1.00,"I honestly don't know how they saw this as an acceptable product- I thought something was wrong with me the first few days I was was using the product. Took approximately 48 hours of non-use for sense of taste to return. How did this make it past the testing phase?"
1.00,"This is the messiest toothpaste I have ever used. The gel is more like a liquid and keeps seeping out of the toothpaste container unless the cap is put on really tight. I have two teenagers and a husband who will not take the time to put it on tight. This morning was the last straw. Even though the cap was closed, the toothpaste had leaked out during the night and caused a long line across the counter and down into the sink. So much leaks out that it is not worth the money. I threw it away."
3.00,"I love this Crest!! This Crest complete totally cleans your teeth and makes your mouth feel fresh and clean."
4.00,"Got a pack of 4 for $9 at costco.  They work pretty well so far.  For the first three weeks or so of using it, i experienced sensitivity in some of my teeth during use because of the fluoride they put in for the whitening.  It seems to work pretty well and doesn't taste too bad either."
5.00,"This is the only toothpaste my husband will use. He has sensitive teeth and it works great. Keeps your breath fresh all day long too!"
4.00,"It worked really good. I just really did not like the taste. But I am confident that this was doing what I want and need. My teeth felt clean and smooth after using it."
4.00,"I loved how it made my mouth feel clean and fresh!"
1.00,"You have been warned...Do not use this product...I used it twice...mouth was in so much pain could not sleep a wink....My tongue swelled to the point I had trouble swallowing...Tongue hurt so bad I could not touch it. 2 days later....pain has decreased...gums still sore....taste buds shot....Some skin peeling from the inside of my mouth. It's like rinsing with paint thinner...Cannot believe this product is stil on the shelves."
4.00,"cleaned well, foamed up nicely, probably won't buy unless cheaper than what I already buy"
4.00,"This product did a great job making my teeth feel clean and fresh. I like the flavor and the texture of the product."
5.00,"This rinse has everything and more. It does wonders and your mouth feels clean and refreshed. It is an added plus to your daily routine for your mouth and teeth."
5.00,"I have teenagers that are always in a hurry and don't take the time to brush properly, these products made a huge difference in their dental check ups and our dentist recommends them as well."
5.00,"I have used Crest Pro Health Toothpaste in the past. I love the gritty feeling it gives when you brush. The new toothpaste is better at giving your teeth the clean feeling."
5.00,"this product is really worth its money it is great."
1.00,"i got two tubes of this stuff one for me and one for my husband. It was like straight sugar! The taste wasn't bad but after brushing it felt more like i had chewed a wad of sugary bubble gum instead of brushed my teeth. both tubes went straight to the trash."
5.00,"When my sample ran out, I ran out and bought more! It makes my teeth and whole mouth feel so clean!"
5.00,"My teeth and breath were really fresh! My family wants me to switch to this toothpaste they liked it so much!"
4.00,"Its's a good product for the price I paid. I love a great toothpaste. It makes a difference in how my teeth feel and look. Thanks Crest!"
5.00,"I love this toothpaste. It has a wonderful flavor and does the job."
2.00,"I was always jealous of my cousin, Tony. Her mother bought crest. My mom made us use pepsodent. I can remember how wonderful crest tasted. Tony and I used to sneak into the bathroom at her house, squeeze the crest onto our fingers, and eat it! Like a treat! Fast forward many many years later and I decided to give crest a try. The idea of actively removing gingivitis made the product all that much more appealing. After ordering and receiving the crest pro-health I noticed, while reading the label, a warning that it had an ingredient that could cause staining. I researched Pro-health and staining and decided not to eat the crest anymore! Brown teeth! Stains that need removing professionally by a dentist. The reports of stringy mouth goo and tongue numbing. Now I know you can't believe everything on the internet.. but there is a lot of scary anecdotal evidence out there, and a lot of alternative products that don't use the staining fluoride found in the crest. Personally I don't choose to take the chance and find out. This is a pass for me."
5.00,"This again is a little expensive but it really does a great job of cleaning your teeth and gives a long lasting freshness!"
5.00,"I would definitely continue to use this mouthwash. It left me with a clean and fresh feeling in my mouth."
4.00,"This product leaves you with an awesome fresh mouth/breath."
3.00,"This mouthwash was nice. It leaves a film which bothers me a little but I fell like that is suppose to be there to help prevent plaque build up."
4.00,"i really liked this. It worked great for hours and didn't taste bad at all."
5.00,"this product works realy good and you get a good clean feeling after brushing"
5.00,"This product keeps your teeth feeling very clean. You breath is very minty. I have very sensitive teeth and it worked fine on mine. I can't tell that it really does any more \"whitening\" than the rest but it is good. I would recommend it."
1.00,"after using this toothpaste once, I noticed a burning, numbing sensation the minute I was done brushing my teeth. 2 days later, I woke up with the peeling that every other 1-star review talked about. the inside of my lower lip now burns, and my upper gums hurt. I got this toothpaste after I started smoking again, and I started noticing a change in my gums. the point of getting this toothpaste was to prevent my gums from receding, but I would guess that this toothpaste would do it first! the funny thing is that Sensodyne has almost the exact amount of fluoride in it (0.15% vs 0.16%). anyway, I'll need Sensodyne to fix the problem that Crest causes me. I will be taking advantage of their 60 day guarantee and getting a refund."
5.00,"My 2 year old loves this toothpaste. It has a good flavor to him, and a fun design on the tube."
5.00,"The Crest rinse was pleasant to use. It has a very good, fresh taste and left my mouth feeling clean and fresh. I will definitely use it again."
4.00,"It left me with a very clean feeling all day long. It didnt burn like some rinses can either."
4.00,"makes your mouth feel fresh and clean . Made my teeth feel polished;)"
1.00,"As I said in my title...  I didn't buy this through amazon but I wanted to review this product anyway. I bought this because I was worried about my gums because one spot on them was irritated for reasons unknown so I wanted to know if maybe this could clear that up.  Bad gums also runs in my family so I have been trying to be proactive about keeping them healthy.  I regret using this because now my tongue is so sore that I can barely talk, my lips are so dry and I use chapstick like a maniac, and the gums are red and they were pink before.  Maybe this is for people who have serious gum disease, I'll just stick to colgate."
1.00,"As many others have said, this STRIPPED my sense of taste for TWO WEEKS after only using once!  This shouldn't even be allowed on the market.  Do not buy!"
4.00,"love this tooth paste makes my mouth feel clean and it tingles and I know its working"
5.00,"Crest ProHealth makes your mouth and teeth really clean and it has a fresh minty taste. I really like Crest ProHealth and other Crest products, have found that Crest cleans your teeth better than similar products and the clean feeling last a long time."
3.00,"This is a very handy, all at once purchase of Crest's Pro-Health line. As these products will last for a varying amount of time, I feel like it's a great thing to buy if you are interested in switching brands, moving (and just want to start over with all mouthcare) or want to set up an extra set of stuff at a summer house, or a dorm or something along those lines. It doesn't seem like the type of collection that will be constantly re-ordered. As for the individual products, I like some more than others. The floss is nice - but the plastic box size is large, making it more ideal for the type of floss that stays home, rather than travels in your purse. The toothpaste has a very sweet flavor, and not as minty as I prefer, so though it works nicely, is not my favorite brand. The mouthwash lacks the burn of more astringent varieties, and has an odd, almost licorice-like aftertaste that isn't unappealing, but markedly strange. The toothbrush is probably my favorite of the grouping and has a nice, solid handle and great bristles that feel like they are doing a quite thorough job of cleaning your teeth!"
4.00,"Just love it and my mouth feels good and refreshed afterwards"
1.00,"Killed my sense of taste, like the tip of my tongue was burned. And stained my teeth too. I can't believe this stuff is still on the market !! Back to Listerine."
4.00,"This toothpaste is great transition from the bubble gum/fruity flavors for small children, into the minty adult flavors. Subscribe and Save is great!"
5.00,"I love this toothpaste. When I use it, I feel like I have just been to the dentist. It tastes great too!"
5.00,"This product is wonderful!! I love how clean it makes your teeth. I have sensitive teeth and everything bothers them. This product was absolutely wonderful!!"
5.00,"My teeth felt so clean after using this product. The taste was great too."
4.00,"The overall best thing I like about the toothpaste was the \"clean\" feeling of my teeth...some toothpastes don't have that lasting clean mouth effect but this one does."
4.00,"Very refreshing. Controls the amount of plaque so its easier to keep my teeth clean."
5.00,"I've been using Crest's Pro-Health toothpaste for quite awhile now and I love how it has reduced my plaque buildup. I can just feel how clean my teeth are and when I don't get to the dentist as often as I should I know brushing with the Pro-Health line of toothpastes will keep my teeth clean and my gums healthy."
5.00,"Love this toothpaste. It has kind of a grit to it which really seems to get my mouth clean. The minty taste lasts for hours and I feel a lot more confident about my oral hygiene using this toothpaste than I ever have, which is awesome. Thanks Crest, and thanks Amazon for this being prime eligible. Appreciated."
5.00,"Crest clinical toothpaste made my teeth feel sqeeky clean! I loved the feeling of my teeth using this toothpaste."
5.00,"I loved this toothpaste! The taste was great and left my mouth feeling clean and fresh! I woke up without my usual morning breath. Great buy!"
4.00,"This product can be given an overall rating of good. It lives up to the Crest name."
5.00,"I love the clean feeling I get after using Crest ProHealth toothpaste. It does a great job with Plaque control too! It pairs well with the ProHealth floss and rinse for a very clean mouth."
1.00,"If you like brown stains in between your teeth then this mouthwash is perfect for you! Lmao last time I checked mouthwash was supposed to clean your teeth."
5.00,"Love the great taste and smooth feeling on my teeth. Great value and keep up the great work Crest."
5.00,"Makes my mouth really clean with a nice 'soft' mint taste - it's not harsh or burning. So gentle my children even use it. Will definitely keep buying."
4.00,"At first was not sure if i would ever buy it again,But, my mouth felt so clean way to go Crest."
1.00,"The cap will not close on the tube. It has never sealed. The tube leaks when I lay it flat, when I stand it upright and even when I try to keep it at an angel with the open end higher than the bottom of the tube. Half has gone in my mouth, the rest around my bathroom."
5.00,"Really liked it! Gave a clean feeling with each use! Tasted great!"
4.00,"I've always liked Crest products, and the clinical toothpaste was great! Left my mouth feeling very clean & fresh!"
4.00,"It left my mouth feeling clean and fresh breath that lasted much longer than my nrmal mouthwash! Another great product."
5.00,"Wonderful product! The perfect toothepaste for anybody!"
5.00,"I love this toothpaste!! It gets my teeth clean, and they stay clean! I am a big coffee drinker, and this helps keep them from staining! Thanks for this product!!!"
5.00,"This is a great product. It doesn't have a strong taste and last all day."
4.00,"This toothpaste left my mouth feeling fresh and clean."
5.00,"I love this tooth paste ever since i started to use it im stuck. Not going back.. t maes my teeth and mouth feel so clean. Also i love taste and the amount of bubbles it makes in my mouth..Best tooth paste ever."
3.00,"I was excited to try this product but once I put it in my mouth the hydrogen peroxide in the mouth rinse was too overpowering. It actually made me want to spit it out right away because it kind of foamed up. I am sure it sure it does a great jog killing germs but it was a little off putting to me."
5.00,"I am trying the crest prohealth clinical mouthwash and i like it. It provides freshness to my mouth and also keeps it clean. Another thing that i like about it is that it doesn't leave my mouth with a burning sensation after use. Works great and will buy it again."
5.00,"I've always loved the Crest products and the new ProHealth line is now my absolute favorite."
5.00,"This toothpaste was smooth. The flavor was not overpowering, and left my mouth feeling amazing."
5.00,"The best toothpaste for evening ever! I only wish it wasn't discontinued. Can depend on it for clean breath and cleaner feeling."
1.00,"I've been using Pro-Health mouthwash for the past two years. In that time, I've had unsightly brown staining between teeth that accumulated quickly between dental cleanings. I was perplexed as to the cause -- for over 30 years before starting use of this product I had never had brown staining, and I couldn't identify any big changes to my diet or dental routine. I was just about to order a refill of this mouthwash online, and found these reviews that allowed me to connect the dots. Wow. Thank you, Amazon users!"
1.00,"This mouthwash is terrible for aftertaste. I would use it at night and wake up in the morning with the same disgusting taste. I don't know how to explain it but that alone is a great reason to stay away from it"
4.00,"I was pleasantly surprised by the fresh taste and feel of my mouth after brushing and especially with how long it lasted! I will be purchasing this product again!"
5.00,"I really like this product. It leaves my mouth feeling tingly clean and freshens my breath for longer than my last toothpaste. It has a wintergreen flavor which I haven't had in toothpaste before, but I find enjoyable. It looks like it has slightly whitened my teeth since using it for the last month. The product claims to help prevent tartar, gingivitis, plaque, sensitivity, whitens, and freshens breath. I like that in addition to the freshening my mouth it also has all these dental health aids. Excellent product offered at a good price through Amazon. Highly recommended!"
1.00,"I used at least a full large tube of both the clean mint and the cinnamon versions of this. As with other toothpastes I've used over the last 10 years or more, I always brush my teeth with a Braun/Oral B electric toothbrush.The only good effect of this product is that it does seem to whiten my teeth a bit compared to toothpastes without whitening agents.In the neutral category I'd put taste and the feeling of a clean mouth immediately afterward. This is no better or worse than others in this respect. Sensitivity protection is also adequate as such products go, but not as good as Crest's specific Sensitivity toothpastes which, for my sensitive teeth, work better than any others I've tried.In the definitely negative category I'd put:1. Mouth slime. Others have mentioned this, and it is real. I'm not sure what the semi-opaque thick whitish mucus consistency stuff is, but there is more production of it with this paste than with any other I've ever used. It is a constant problem when using this product routinely. It does not just form after brushing and then you get rid of it and it's gone. It keeps forming.2. Dry mouth. The longer I used it, the worse this condition got. Toward the end of my usage, the sensation was so strong that my mouth felt dry even when I was swishing water around in my mouth. Ugh!3. Sense of taste impairment. With the dry mouth came decreased sense of taste which made all food less palatable. Again, not only is taste impaired, but my mouth felt dry even when chewing on moist food.4. Bad taste in mouth. While I never got complaints from my wife about bad breath while using this stuff, within a couple of hours of use I'd get a bad taste in my mouth which eating or drinking would lessen, but not eliminate.5. Drippy. It was difficult to use this without it dripping out of my mouth while brushing. The cinnamon is more paste-like and softer and is even more of a problem this way than the cool mint which has a more gel-like consistency. Both dripped on my shirt more than any other toothpaste I've ever used.I am not a Crest hater. My favorite toothpaste long term is Crest's Sensitivity with Scope and Whitening. It has sensitivity protection second only to Crest's Sensitivity Original Formula, adequate whitening, no mouth irritation, minimal mouth slime, very fresh feeling and fresh breath, no bad taste in my mouth hours afterward, no dry mouth or taste impairment, and no drippiness. The only negative is price per ounce. I wish they still made it in a large tube like the 8.2 oz Pro.Health, rather than those ridiculous 4.2 oz tubes which they replaced the larger tubes with and raised the price at the same time . . . . Still, it's worth every penny."
4.00,"Happy with this toothpaste, no ill-effects at all. Despite using it twice a day, I still have my cheeks, gums, tongue, and even my teeth!"
4.00,"Made my teeth feel squeakey clean. My mouth felt clean and refreshed, and was a great price."
4.00,"I have used all of the Clinical Crest products for some time and love them. They keep my teeth feeling like I just came from the dentist."
1.00,"the toothpaste would easily leak out. most toothpaste i've purchased have a stronger consistency. i'll find toothpaste all over my sink if the cap isn't closed tightly"
1.00,"This may be the worst product I have ever bought. I thought it was just me but after reading all the other reviews of this product line I know it is not. I used the product as directed last night before bed. First off it burns but only mildly, but the main thing i noticed during use was the excessive foaming. I looked like Cujo by the time 30 seconds was up. Then after spitting it out i noticed the entire inside of my mouth coated in foam, worst of all my tongue was caked with the stuff. I kept spitting to get rid of it but never could. So I went to bed. This morning going on 12 hours later and I still cannot taste anything. I've been a crest toothpaste user since I was a kid and will continue to use it, but didn't anyone test this product before deciding to sell it? It is a better dieting aid then mouth wash.... though I presume if you don't feel like eating or drinking anything than there is less of a chance for plaque so there is a bonus there too."
4.00,"My teeth felt super clean after brushing. The freshness lasted a long time."
5.00,"Great toothpaste I always loved Crest Prohealth, the new clinical toothpaste is better than ever. Loved the clean feel it left on my teeth and the minty taste."
2.00,"This has to be the worst toothpaste I have ever used. It dries my mouth, leaves a film around your gums/teeth (FYI: don't `swallow it!) and I developed a sore throat which after a month made me sound like a heavy smoker with emphysema&lt;-probably because of swallowing the film/toothpaste for a month. I thought I was getting sick even went to the doctor. Doctors said it's something that is irritating my throat, maybe allergies?. I've lived in the same area my whole life why would all of sudden in my last twenties get allergic to something. Well turns out it was this toothpaste! And the only reason I found out because when I finally ran out of pro health went to the local pharmacy, they didn't' carry it so I just settled on another kind of toothpaste. Symptoms cleared up and I was back to my normal self. Although my experience was beyond strange, I would suggest you get a travel size or a small tube just to test it out, that's if you are willing to go through the possible side effects of this product. You never know it may work for you but based on my own experience, what I have read on here and other reviews..it's a no go and will never again buy this product."
5.00,"This is the only mouth wash I buy. I'm not brand loyal to many things, but I love the protection it gives our teeth. A few $$ for this saves me dental bills and helps me feel like my teeth are cleaner."
5.00,"I like this toothpaste. It tastes good and feels good on my teeth. I like that it gets the job done but is not too strong."
5.00,"This toothpaste is the absolute best. It gives my teeth the feeling of just leaving the dentist after a cleaning ...every day . Great taste , and my teeth look great !"
1.00,"This product really works. My teeth felt very clean after using it. But, it left a burning sensation on my tongue. I used it only two times but when I ate a ritz cracker with cheese the taste was off. Then looked up side effects on the interweb and found that I am not the only one with issues. It is disappointing since it seems to really work and yes I always rinse my mouth after brushing."
3.00,"The toothpaste left my teeth and mouth clean and fresh, but I wasn't thrilled with the taste. Also, it's pretty high priced as far as toothpaste goes. Not sure I'd buy it again."
5.00,"Liked the product good for keeping my mouth healthy and clean"
1.00,"I saw that this product helps kill bacteria and fights gum disease so I decided to give it a try. WORST MISTAKE EVER, this mouth wash burns very badly and your mouth foams up for minutes afterwards (like an animal with rabies). I used this mouth wash only twice and now the front portion of my tongue cannot taste ANYTHING. It's been about 12 hours since I've used the mouth wash and I am wondering when will my taste buds return to normal. This product is TERRIBLE!"
1.00,"I've had two distinct issues in the use of this product. I first experienced a decline in my ability to taste things, which was accompanied by a burning sensation (as if I'd eaten a piece of hot pizza); I used it three or four times until one of my salivary glands on the left (in front of my ear at the top of my jaw joint) became extremely swollen and tender. I was also unable to chew without significant discomfort, in the form of a burning sensation. Upon doing some research, it sounds like I'm not the only person who has experienced these reactions. Now that I've stopped using the product, I'm just hoping the swelling goes down in a reasonable amount of time."
5.00,"I am a bulk buyer so this is a good deal and it is a very good product."
4.00,"A great mouthwash! It helps keep mouth fresh and clean everyday."
5.00,"The crest pro health product line is a great product. My teeth look and feel great- worth the extra money"
5.00,"Made my mouth feel clean. The taste was not the best."
1.00,"So far I have not noticed any staining, but that may change as time goes by. I will update this review if needed. The rinse does not burn, yet it has an odd chemical taste to me. It does leave your mouth feeling clean. The hygienist said that my gums look healthier since starting the product. I use the rinse in combination with Crest Pro-Health toothpaste and a Sonic Care toothbrush. Overall, I would recommend this rinse so far.Update 3/1/13: I still haven't noticed any staining, but I have noticed a couple of symptoms that are even worse. My sense of taste is off. Things taste bland and just different. I'm not sure how to describe it. Also for the last few days I have had terribly sore gums. I can barely floss. Yesterday I noticed some odd lumps near my gum line like little blisters. I called and had the dentist fit me in. He said that he sees three side effects frequently from the Crest Pro-Health products: staining, gum soreness, and loss of taste. The staining can take up to a year to show up for some people. He suggested that I throw the Pro-Health in the trash. I took his advice. I already have two of the three bad side effects; I'm not waiting for the third to show up. I'm changing my rating from a four to a one, and I'm going back to Listerine."
5.00,"My husband and I really like this toothpaste. It's makes you teeth feel really clean."
5.00,"I recently got braces and Crest Clinical Mouth Rinse has helped my mouth feel clean after each meal. It is easy to use with no stinging sensation. It's the perfect compliment to brushing."
4.00,"Left my mouth feeling really clean.I would use this again."
5.00,"until we tried crest pro-health we would switch brands or whatever was on sale. this what we will be buying from now on. thank you."
4.00,"Good flavor, long-lasting freshness. I don't know if it will really significantly decrease my plaque before my next dentist visit because I haven't used it long enough, and it is pricey compared to other toothpastes I have used."
4.00,"I like Crest and use it more than other kinds, but couldn't really tell the difference between the plaque control and whatever other kind of crest I've used. It's all good."
4.00,"I love this it makes my teeth feel really clean and healthy"
1.00,"Used this two days in a row, morning and night, and can't taste jack. Did a google search and discovered that Crest is aware of this problem but sees no reason to fix it. NOPE. BUY SOMETHING ELSE. I'd like my tastebuds back please!"
4.00,"I really like the taste and it felt like it lasted all day. The best part is my teenagers tried it and have asked me to continue to buy it!!"
5.00,"I love crest! I tried the mouth wash and I really dod like it. It has no harsh alcohol taste to it. Keeps your breath fresh. Great Product!"
5.00,"This was a great product and will be buying it in the future! Teeth feel clean and fresh all day long!"
4.00,"I have always been a Colgate kinda gal but the Crest is a great product! Glad I was able to try it out!"
1.00,"Be very careful with this stuff! I did not have gum problems; tried this as a preventative measure. BAD idea! I started to experience a weird side effect of this stuff, but was not aware it was caused by the toothpaste. Initially I would wake up with the insides of my lip tissue peeling off. A kind of white slimy stuff. Disgusting. Within a week, the insides of my lips AND cheeks were peeling off- same thing, just a lot more of it. By then, I figured out it was the toothpaste, so I stopped using it. Fortunately I figured that out, because the corners of my mouth and lips seemed to have suffered chemical burns as well. I NEVER have that problem because I always keep my lips moisturized. It seemed like, at that point, that my lips were SO burned they were hard and the corners of my mouth were trying to crack open. It has been months since that happened, and my lips are just now recovering. I had my teeth cleaned the other day and fortunately this CRAP did not stain my teeth or cause my gums to recede. Perhaps because I stopped soon enough. I mentioned it to a coworker who told me he had also used it and it caused sores in his mouth. His dentist was aware of other complaints and told him to stop using it. My husband used the stuff and didn't have any problems, so I don't know. Perhaps some people are more sensitive than others. I just caution everyone who tries this stuff to be very aware and stop using it immediately if they notice the peeling ... because it only gets worse from there!"
5.00,"It is the only toothpaste my husband will use. Love it."
5.00,"This toothpaste is amazing! I love the way it keeps my teeth clean all day! Also taste great!"
5.00,"The Crest rinse worked well, did not feel like stingy nettles in my mouth like other brands I've tried. The taste was pleasant and fresh breath until morning."
5.00,"Crest ProHealth is one of my favorite toothpastes. I have had problems with my gums for many years and this toothpastes helps in between check-ups. Thank you!"
5.00,"I have always been a Crest fan, but I love the flavor of this new toothpaste. I also like that the rinse doesn't burn and sting, yet, you feel very clean."
5.00,"I love this mouthwash. It has become a part of my morning and evening routine. My mouth feels so much cleaner and fresher in the morning. No morning breath!"
5.00,"I received a sample of Crest Pro Health rinse from my dentist. I used it up in a couple of days, and purchased a large bottle. Once my two sons, then my husband smelled it's fresh scent and didn't hear me complain about the taste (other rinses really burn up my mouth), they all gave it a try. We were all then hooked! It made our mouths feel great, gave us all great breath, but most importantly, our teeth never looked better from any other rinse. I recommend Crest Pro Health to anyone who wants clean, healthy gums and teeth."
4.00,"Good product, makes your teeth feel nice and clean."
4.00,"Great clean feeling. My teeth felt cleaner than they have in a long time."
5.00,"& does the job! My mouth feels so fresh & clean for hours until I need to brush again. My dentist asked me what I had been doing differently b/c my gums looked so good & I told him I was using this toothpaste & he was happy, & so was I b/c I'm prone to cavities & didnt have any at my check up."
5.00,"It did not make my eyes water or burn my mouth. I would recommend this product to anyone, even my daughter likes it."
3.00,"I thought I ordered the clear liquid, not the blue. The clear has been discontinued and amazon is sneaky in the footnotes that they may alter which one they send you. P&amp;G is changing the clear liquid version to a different assortment and more expensive, and the color can stain plaque on the teeth, so brush carefully."
5.00,"This is my husbands favorite toothpaste, and I enjoy it myself. The flavor is good without being overbearing and it leaves a nice clean feeling. Wish it were more affordable though!!"
5.00,"The crest pro health toothpaste was a hit in our house! IT got our teeth squeaky clean and fresh!"
1.00,"So I swished for 30 seconds, got chemical burns to my gums and lost the ability to taste food for about a day. It was pretty bad and it took hours to get the burning and bad taste out of my mouth. It contains Cetylpyridinium chloride, which some (a lot?) of people are sensitive to. Threw it in the trash."
1.00,"This can't be legal. We are all in the same tasteless, disgusting boat. Isn't this how class action lawsuits begin?"
5.00,"this is a great product! I did not think a toothpaste could leave my mouth so clean feeling and fresh feeling!"
5.00,"Worked great -- left my mouth feeling clean and refreshed. I recommend this product."
4.00,"left my teeth feeling very clean. i also enjoyed the minty flavor."
5.00,"i will continue using it, it is a very good product."
5.00,"Plaque seems to build on my teeth fast and my plaque level is lower since I began using it."
5.00,"This works great and leaves your mouth feeling so clean. Pretty strong taste, but worth it to leave your mouth feeling great."
5.00,"the mouthwash had a great taste which is a big plus.mouthwash left a clean feeling after use."
5.00,"Great product!"
5.00,"Crest has always been used in our household. This is yet another one of their great products."
5.00,"I use the crest 3Dwhite toothpaste and the crest 3D white rinse, together they make my teeth sparkling white."
5.00,"I definitely noticed an improvement in my smile with this crest toothpaste."
5.00,"I have always liked the Crest Oral-B products and this toothpaste lives up to that reputation. It gets my teeth really clean, especially between dental visits."
1.00,"I honestly cannot believe that this product is still on the market after so many complaints. I only had to use this product one time to experience the adverse side effects that the vast majority of the reviewers for this product have experienced. Immediately after using the mouthwash, my tongue felt as if I might have been rubbing it with sandpaper (that's how harsh this stuff is). However, since it was mouthwash and mouthwash generally has that effect (though I've never experienced it so badly), I did not think anything of it. About six hours later, with my tongue still feeling incredibly odd, I tried to eat dinner and realized that I only had taste on the very back of my tongue. This was the case until the next day. I did not know that this product also turned teeth brown until I read the reviews for this product on Amazon to see if anyone else had my experiences with taste-loss and a tongue that felt like it's been scraped with sandpaper. I was surprised to learn that this mouthwash could get any worse than it already was. After reading about the brown teeth, I examined my own teeth and realized that my teeth were indeed tinged a light brown on the sides - after only one use! This was despite the fact that I had brushed my teeth thoroughly, as usual, before using this product. I mention the fact that I brushed thoroughly because I have read 5-star reviews in which the reviewers state that the only reason that this product turns other people's teeth brown is because they either don't brush well or don't brush at all. I brush my teeth as well as can be expected for everyday, at-home cleaning. I would have to get a professional cleaning to have them cleaned anymore thoroughly than they already are. Needless to say, I DO NOT recommend this product! No matter what oral health benefits this product may provide, side effects as drastic as the ones most of us have experienced should be prominently featured on the back of the bottle in at least a similarly-sized font as the rest of the information on the bottle; not in tiny print! No consumer purchases non-prescription mouthwash with the expectation that it might ruin their sense of taste and turn their teeth brown. I was not able to get rid of the brown stains until my teeth were professionally cleaned. Since the company that sells this product doesn't have the decency to adequately warn consumers, I advise people to avoid buying this bottle of acid altogether. For my part, I will not be buying anymore Crest products, period."
5.00,"The active ingredient in the Crest Pro Health Series for treating sensitive teeth is different than the active ingredient in Sensodyne. My husband and I have been using Sensodyne for years but he always had lingering sensitivity issues. I picked up two tubes of this on a whim during a errand shopping trip during my lunch hour. My husband was reluctant to change brands, but after a tube of the Crest Pro Health, he asked me to buy more not knowing there was another tube under the sink. I asked if I should pick up more Sensodyne, and he said no, the Pro Health worked and was totally controlling his sensitivity. I get the same effects from both of the active ingredients so I can use either brand. But because Pro Health is working better for my husband, we've switched over. So if Sensodyne isn't working for you, give this a try."
5.00,"My whole family used this toothpaste and had excellent results. Our teeth felt clean and appeared to be whiter. The flavor was good, not too strong like some toothpastes. I will definitely keep purchasing it!"
5.00,"I always enjoy trying Crest's new products as they always tend to top their previous versions. The new pro health toothpaste has a fresh taste and leaves your whole mouth feeling great"
5.00,"I love the clean feeling it give your teeth, it feels like you just came back from the dentist."
1.00,"Honestly...this toothpaste is the worst I've ever tried...it tastes like sandy Bengay!! It smells like Bengay and tastes like what Bengay seems it would taste like...plus other reviews say it may stain teeth and not whiten like it says??? Can it get any worse for a toothpaste?? I haven't been able to use it long enough to notice the stain factor but I'm definitely not going to continue using it...just not a good experience."
5.00,"I like knowing that I'm doing something good for my teeth besides just cleaning them!"
5.00,"I LOVE how clean this makes my teeth feel! I will absolutely keep using this! Thanks"
4.00,"My teeth looks much cleaner,and the gums are stronger."
5.00,"I bought the Crest Pro-Health rinse. It tickles my tongue and gives my mouth a fresh, clean feeling."
5.00,"I've been using this toothpaste for a little over two weeks and love it. Not only are my teeth whiter but they feel cleaner without having to go to a dentist. I recommend this toothpaste highly to anyone looking for something new and great to try."
5.00,"This Cresat product proved true to its claim. My mouth felt refreshingly clean after use!"
3.00,"I'm a long-time user of plain old regular Crest toothpaste - it's my preferred favorite and the one our whole family uses. While it works well at keeping our teeth clean and helping to protect against cavities, I was happy to give this new Crest toothpaste a try. I like the fact that it combines so many benefits in one toothpaste: protects against cavities, gingivitis, plaque, sensitive teeth, tartar buildup, stains, and it freshens breath. I was a little concerned about the staining warning I read on the product label, however after using this toothpaste regularly for a few weeks we have not noticed any staining whatsoever on our teeth. While this particular Crest toothpaste did a good job of cleaning and protecting our teeth, I have to say I still prefer the regular plain old Crest toothpaste. The Pro-Health toothpaste has gritty silica particles in it, that it uses to clean your teeth and help remove stains-you can easily see these in the paste. While they are not overly abrasive or harsh, I do find it noticeable and I don't care for the feeling of it. Also I don't find that this toothpaste foams as much as the regular Crest toothpaste - not necessarily a sign that it's not cleaning, I know, but when you get used to one thing you tend to prefer it and my preference is for a toothpaste that foams nicely when I'm brushing. Lastly the 'minty freshness' that I find when using regular Crest toothpaste seems to be lacking a bit with this Pro-Health toothpaste. It is minty, and my mouth does feel clean after brushing with it, but for some reason it doesn't seem quite 'as' minty as what I'm used to. I can see the appeal of having all the benefits this toothpaste offers in one convenient tube, but I think I will stick to using my old standby and favorite which has been working well for us."
4.00,"However, the tube I bought seems to be filled more with air than with product. I realize they are sold by weight, but this tube seemed 1/2 full after the first use forced out the air."
5.00,"this is one of those products that I don't like to run out of. Love the fact that it does multiple things without alcohol in it"
5.00,"A little pricey, but I love how clean my teeth feel!"
3.00,"I am not sure about withening part but my mouth feels clean and refreshed."
5.00,"I love all Crest products, but the mouth rinse is the best. My husband and I like how it's not overly minty/strong as comparable rinses are. And it leaves a very clean feeling."
4.00,"I liked the way it made my teeth and mouth feel clean and fresh. I didn't think the taste was all that great, but was acceptable."
3.00,"I am a regular Crest user, but I have been using this toothpaste for more than a week, and I don't notice anything different about my teeth or how my mouth feels."
5.00,"I liked the taste of this toothpaste, plus I am excited to see that it will actually help prevent Plaque from returning!"
1.00,"My dentists recently recommended I start using a mouthwash, so I perused the shelves at the supermarket and picked up some of this. After only using it 3 times I could tell that something was up with my taste buds. I thought I was imagining things, so I check on the internet. Seems to be a common problem. I can no longer really taste much of anything, salty or sweet. Food is just bland and tasteless. I'm using as directed (per the label) and it burns quit a bit towards the end of a rinse and I have some swell on the inside of my right cheek. Needless to say the rest is going down the drain. Avoid this product."
1.00,"I really did not like this mouthwash. It was like putting hydrogen proxide in my mouth. I will not use again, it was really expensive too."
5.00,"I absolutely love this new mouthwash. It is, by far my favorite. It makes my mouth feel great and I know that it is working."
5.00,"is really good, it leaves my mouth fresh and clean."
1.00,"Worst mouth wash ever. After using it for couple weeks, I start to notice my teeth have a lot of brown stains that I never have before. At first I though it could be because I didn't go to the dentist to clean my teeth for a long time and it started to get dirty, and then one day I read on the label that one of the ingredients might stain the teeth and then I did a search on Google. Low and b hold, a lot of people have the same experience. Worst part of it is that I couldn't get the stain off, now I have to spend $100 to see the dentist, hopefully he can remove it."
4.00,"This was my first time trying out a product from the pro-health line. I found the toothpaste to do a good job at keeping my teeth feeling clean. I would definitely recommend this product to others."
5.00,"My teeth and gums felt much cleaner!! In between uses it seemed to repel tartar."
5.00,"I loved this Crest toothpaste! I love how clean your teeth feel when you use it. I always know that I can count on the Crest name to have a high quality product."
5.00,"This is by far, my favorite toothpaste. My teeth feel clean, all day long! It also leaves my breath fresh. I love it."
5.00,"I love this product and so does my Family. It leaves them feeling like their mouth is actually clean, unlike some of the others we have tried. I didn't like the price but I know that is more due to where I live and not the actual product. I would recommend this to EVERYONE!!!!"
5.00,"The toothpaste works really well and cleans my teeth really well."
4.00,"This toothpaste was equivalent to many i have tried. It is a good toothpaste but for that price i can buy a less expensive one and still have the same features."
5.00,"i love toothpaste that does more than just clean my teeth. i need a little help with my enamel, and this seems to really help. it does cost more, but at my age, my teeth are worth it"
5.00,"I love this mouthwash. I have been using it for about three weeks now. It keeps my mouth feeling fresh for a lot longer than anything else that I have tried. The taste is mild too so I am able to rinse with it longer. People tell me that my teeth are looking whiter as well. I think this is the best mouthwash on the market and I will continue to purchase it!"
5.00,"I have always been a user of Crest products. The price was great and the quality is excellent. Does not change the taste of food."
4.00,"The night time product is my favorite and keeps your teeth smooth and clean."
5.00,"You mouth feels super clean and your teeth are so smooth!! Very good prduct. Will buy again."
5.00,"This product made my teeth so shiny and so clean feeling. My teeth felt like they do when I leave the dentist. I definitely recommend this product!!"
1.00,"I am only writing this because I spent alot of time at the dentist, the doctor and the ER trying to figure this out..I developed an allergic reaction (I guess that is what it is) to the stannous flouride in this stuff...I didn't know it was my cheeks peeling off, I thought it was allergies or thyroid problems...shame on Crest! I have seen hundreds of complaints on the internet.....I hope they sue the hell out of them.....haven't US consumers had enough of this sh*$!"
4.00,"I loved the product and how much it lasted and made my teeth feel clean after a few hours even. It is something i will keep using for sure!"
4.00,"Really loved this toothpaste..my whole family actually! It's effective againts tartar build up & has this long lasting fresh breath in your mouth."
5.00,"I was so happy to have a mouthwash that made my mouth feel fresh and felt like it was working to get rid of the plaque."
5.00,"I love this rinse. Your mouth will feel clean and fresh for hours. My husband and I have an issue with bleeding gums and this product has helped to reduce it greatly! Unfortunately, you can't always find it in the grocery but when you can, I suggest you try it. It really seems to help with overall dental and gum health!"
5.00,"I loved how clean and fresh my mouth felt after brushing. I would recommend this toothpaste to a friend and will definitely buy it again!"
5.00,"I loved this toothpaste, it didn't have a super strong flavor--sometimes they are so strong they almost seem to burn your mouth. It did a fantastic job at cleaning my teeth and I really think they already look whiter"
5.00,"...left my mouth feeling clean and fresh. It definitely compares to the results of a professional cleaning."
4.00,"This was my first time using this product and I was impressed!"
4.00,"I really like this product and would definately buy again. I have not bought any prohealth products I didn't like."
5.00,"My 2 yr old's dentist has recommended that we move from fluoride free toothpaste to ones containing fluoride. My son enjoys brushing his teeth because this toothpaste tastes yummy"
1.00,"Been buying this product for quite a while using Subscribe and Save. Product works great, been very happy with it. Now Amazon has arbitrarily decided to remove it from Subscribe and Save, and is suggesting a substitute product (a whitening product) that is more expensive and does not offer the plaque/gingivitis treatment that this product provides. I've marked this product one star because of Amazon's decision to drop it from Subscribe and Save, in order to get their attention. I would otherwise rate it as 5 stars. Thanks Amazon for making it more difficult to get the product I want."
5.00,"I often find it hard to find a mouthwash with beyond great results and taste. I also find it hard to find one that doesnt burn too much but this one is the best ever."
3.00,"This mouthwash makes my mouth feel clean but the aftertaste is very baking soda'ish and since it continues to foam on your teeth the taste spreads, requiring me to need a water rinse which probably defeats the purpose of a long lasting mouth wash."
4.00,"I very much enjoyed this product, as I do most all Crest products. The taste is pleasant for me and I like the way my mouth feels afterwards-so clean! Personally, I still like the Crest Complete better, but this is great if that were out or discontinued."
4.00,"My mouth felt very clean and fresh for a long time after brushing."
5.00,"Good tooth whitener and general toothpaste all around. It's easily worth what I paid for it. I haven't found anything as good as this stuff is!"
4.00,"I've always had a problem with plague and tartar so I was excited to try Crest's new product. The texture was better than some but the flavor was a bit too sweet for me. Can't wait to go to the dentist Monday and see what he thinks of my teeth during cleaning"
2.00,"The problem is that Crest has put marketing above delivering a suitable product. The company fills the shelves of your local big box store with a dazzeling variety of boxes which, essentially, compete for the gullible buyer's desire for \"white\" teeth. Once Crest gets into the customer's cart the \"whitener\" of his or her choice, the company has no concern about how the product works for the customer. One extremely aggravating factor is the use of flip-tops instead of screw-on caps. The flip-tops simply do not close, once the tube is being used. The contents solidify as a paste all over the cap, preventing future closure. The paste cannot be easily cleaned away - and if you attempt to do so using sustained hot water, the tube's contents will permanently transform into a fluid which slowly and continually oozes over your bathroom counter. While I am not in favor of the discourtesy of opening boxed products inside stores, I will do so to assure that I am buying a Crest product (so long as I stick with Crest) which has a conventional screw-on cap rather than flip-top. Once as I watched as two college-aged young women shopping together for toothpaste perused the shelves of variously differentiated Crest packages, each variety proclaiming its \"whitening\" capabilities in slightly different articulation, one blurted out - with no apparent sense of irony - that she wanted to be sure to get the one version which would make her teeth the whitest. For a few months, local stores had one gentle Crest alternative, a green-tea option in the \"expressions\" series; but this quickly ceased to be available either locally or online. Evidently it appealed to too reasonable - and thus too rare -  buyers simply wanting a non-corrosive toothpaste to clean their teeth, without any ridicuous representations akin to the ads even on these amazon.com pages showing gorgeous 20-year-old models with wide-open mouths full of cosmetically enhanced white teeth. The irony in the proliferation of package claims is that, while the packages reveal a variety of chemical content, only an expert in toothpaste bio-chemistry can understand the true variation among these options. Meanwhile most manufacturers of household products today do not care to hear the views of customers or to take into account what any member of their corporate board, for instance, would discover if he or she actually made a point of trying out the product to assess its quality. There is no effective \"customer service\" in this respect. I had thought about mailing back my tube of melted slime which would not stay inside the bottle, but realized that this might only garner me a visit from the FBI or postal inspectors if I addressed a padded envelope to a corporate official. Customers of Crest are in one respect no more to the company than guinea pigs for marketing researchers, trying to see which package will bring in the most revenue. This is the simulacrum of 'democracy' touted by advocates of unregulated \"free market\" capitalism today as if it were the real substance underlying political democracy in America (for which, to protect, we are urged to vote Republican, we owe so dang much to those in the million dollar plus income bracket!)"
5.00,"This is the only mouthwash ill use from now on. it leaves your mouth fresh and clean"
4.00,"This is a good product. Makes my teeth smooth, clean and bright. I have a lower permanent retainer and have a higher level of tarter that builds up. Since using this product, I have a noticed a decrease of tarter build up. THANK YOU CREST!!! This helps greatly in reducing my tarter. Would recommend this product."
1.00,"After using this product for four weeks, I developed terrible brown \"stains\" - actually, some sort of brown deposit, on my teeth.  I tried whitening products, but nothing would take those stains off.  I was at the dentist today.  Both the dentist and the hygenist told my that Crest Pro Health caused those stains.  It took the hygenist an entire hour to get them off of my teeth.  This product should be pulled from the shelves."
5.00,"I really liked the Crest Pro Health toothpaste. I feel like it really controls the amount of plaque from accumulating on my teeth. I noticed a more cleaner, brighter smile. I will definitely continue to use and spread the word amongst my friends."
5.00,"I was afraid the clinical variety would taste like medicine, but the taste was great!"
1.00,"I made an appointment with my dentist because I was sure something terrible was going on with my teeth. I had horrible, HORRIBLE sensitivity, my gums tingled and felt like they were on fire, and I had a constant metallic taste in my mouth. I thought it was stress, hormones, cavities.... I never even considered that it could be my new toothpaste, which I used for about 2 weeks. My dentist told me to use Sensodyne, which I did, religiously, and the sensitivity and pain abated. I ran out of Sensodyne the day before yesterday and used the Crest toothpaste once. ONCE. Instant sensitivity, metallic taste, and weird sensations in my mouth. I was completely gobsmacked. I came onto Amazon to read the reviews and was horrified to see how many people had a similar experience. This toothpaste is TOXIC and CAUSTIC. It should not be sold to anyone, ever. The military should drop it over the territories of enemy forces, as this stuff is chemical warfare. I don't know how Crest continues to sell this nightmarish stuff. DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!"
5.00,"I really like the Pro-Health line. My teeth feel so much cleaner than with other brands. It makes me feel like I am doing something good for myself!"
5.00,"This toothpaste really did keep my mouth feeling clean while helping with the sensitivity I experience."
2.00,"MY DENTAL HYGENIST RECOMMENDED THAT I USE THIS TOOTH PASTE.  HAVING BEEN A REGULAR USER OF CREST FOR MANY YEARS I BOUGHT A TUBE AND USED IT FOR ABOUT 5 DAYS.  AM EXPERIENCING MOST OF THE SYMPTOMS EXPRESSED HERE AND AM GOING BACK TO PLAIN OLD CREST.  RINSING MY MOUTH DID NOT GET RID OF THE STRINGY MUCOSA AND I USED MY FINGERS TO REMOVE WHAT I COULD.  DID NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS GOING ON UNTIL I CHECKED WITH THIS WEB SITE.  I NOTICE SOME FOLKS RATE THIS PRODUCT WITH 5 STARS.  PERHAPS THEY HAVE MORE RESISTANCE THAN I DO."
1.00,"I thought I was imaging the loss of taste in my mouth and the stains on my teeth from using this product, until I read the other review posted here. I would not recommend this at all."
5.00,"this toothpaste is awesome. made me feel clean for hours and no bad breath."
5.00,"I love how clean this makes my teeth and mouth feel. Even better my dentist loves how it makes my teeth look. On my last appointment I was told how great my teeth looked and they mentioned how they wished more patients were like me!"
5.00,"Mouth wash is a huge part of my daily routine both in the morning and night. I loved the fresh feeling that I had after using this mouth wash, usually I don't feel like my teeth are as clean as they could be when I am done brushing my teeth and rinsing with mouth wash. This was a different story! My mouth felt so fresh and clean! I would recommend this to all my family and friends and will be buying more again soon!"
1.00,"This kit of dental products was a mix of items that I usually don't use with those I do (especially the Glide floss), so they offered new territory. The toothbrush was \"medium,\" not the recommended one for my receding gums (and not stated in the product description, but is noted on the product page). It's an Oral-B with their unique design and the bristles that vary in size and angle to reach all around your teeth. I've used this style of brush before and I like it - in fact it's the style I have now, albeit in soft. Five stars for the toothbrush. The toothpaste promised many advantages: sensitivity, cavities/enamel, gingivitis, plaque, tartar, whitening, and fresh breath. The overriding aspect I noted was the whitening (baking soda), which is immediately detected. Sadly, upon further investigation, it was noted that this product, like the oral rinse, may cause staining. Incredible that such products are offered. Zero stars. As previously mentioned, I'm a loyal Glide floss user. This product is ideal for me and the narrow and tricky spaces between a few of my teeth that usually shred other floss. I floss at a minimum 4x a week and I need reliable floss that won't fray or break while navigating my teeth. Easy five stars. Lastly, the oral rinse. I ordered this set of items prior to reading the negative comments about the mouthwash/rinse wherein it was noted that said product causes stains on teeth. While there is a warning on the product label (\"In some cases, antimicrobial rinses may cause surface staining to teeth. This is not permanent or harmful and may be prevented by adequate brushing or removed at your next dental visit\"), I have no desire to be a guinea pig for whether or not it happens to me. Thus, my rating for the oral rinse is zero. I'm a bit pi$$ed that I've already used the toothpaste. Overall, this is a complete hit or miss kit. Two products that are five stars and two that are zero. Given that I would never wish to encourage someone to buy something potentially harmful in a combination pack, I can only recommend the floss and brush and advise that people stay far away from the toothpaste and oral rinse. So then, my overall score is one because the positives don't outweigh the negatives. Purchasing this kit is not recommended at all."
5.00,"This is an awesome toothpaste. I love the clean feeling both day and night.I have told everyone to use this product!"
4.00,"This mouthwash is great. I have always like the pro-health mouthwash and the clinical does a good job as well. The only thing that I did not like about it is the taste. It has a very strong peroxide taste with just a hint of mint flavor. I have rinsed my mouth with just peroxide in the paste and this is what it reminds me of. I will be sticking with just the regular pro-health mouthwash or if I want to save myself some money just rinse with a cheap bottle of peroxide."
4.00,"I loved the fact that there was zero alcohol and the clean mint flavor was just right...my mouth felt clean and fresh, just as I expected it would...however, I will say that compared to other mouthwashes available this one is definitely pricey. It is probaby something I wouldn't buy regularly unless I had a coupon to use or if it was on sale. My other mouthwash is a national brand and I often find great coupons/sales for it...which make it even cheaper than retail...and keeping money in my pocket while still getting what I need is more important than the brand that I use."
5.00,"I liked the way my teeth felt after I used this toothpaste. It had a nice taste."
4.00,"Keeps your breath really fresh and it really, really lasts!"
5.00,"Love Love Love.....! In the morning... And every night. My mouth is fresh. And the mood is right!!!"
2.00,"This toothpaste is highly buzzword compliant. Perhaps that, combined with my being in the target market, is why I bought it in the first place. I haven't been happy with the purchase. The most annoying problem is that the container leaks. The toothpaste is thinner than the pastes that I normally use and, apparently, is too thin for the flip-top tubes that Crest favors. The taste also seems off to me. It's both sweeter and milder than I'd prefer. Finally, as others have mentioned, it's a bit on the gritty side. I do wonder what that's doing to my teeth."
5.00,"I loved this toothpaste. It left my mouth feeling like I had just walked out of my dentist's office after having my teeth cleaned. I'm so glad I was able to try it and plan to tell my friends and neighbors about it!"
4.00,"I bought the Crest Pro-Health clinical mouthwash. I didn't mind this product. It does the job it stats its suppose to do. I did have a little linger of aftertaste but was not thrown by this. My husband has gum disease and really liked this. It didn't sting and was not over powering. I would recommend this to others especially those with sensitive mouth."
5.00,"My husband and I both really like this product .As we get older and have a few problems with out teeth and gums that we can't afford to have fixed, we really have to rely on good quality products. This rinse is one of the best and helps us maintain the best dental help we can get with over the counter products."
4.00,"I have been using the toothpaste for about two weeks and I haven't notice any change. I guess you have to use the toothpaste for a while."
1.00,"This toothpaste is horrible, the gel is so dry and it's impossible to brush your teeth. I don't know if I got a defective item although both were the same, but will not buy crest again."
5.00,"My daughter brushes almost every time she is supposed to now. She likes this rinse for some reason I cannot identify. I recommend it."
5.00,"There's nothing better than when your mouth feels clean and fresh. This did the job!"
5.00,"I think this is marketed to seniors but I am in my 30's and figure preventative is always good. I like the taste of it as well."
5.00,"My teeth feel (and taste!) clean for hours after I've brushed. I love it!"
5.00,"I love crest pro health toothpaste. It contains all the right ingredients for me. It didn't bother my sometimes sensitive teeth, as a matter of fact, it helped the situation. My teeth felt truly clean and my smile was brighter. It had just the right amount of minty flavor without being overbearing. I will continued to use this product."
5.00,"I really liked how my teeth felt cleaner longer than other toothpastes I've use. Would buy again."
5.00,"Crest Pro-Health Toothpaste is a great product! It keeps your teeth clean and fresh and has many different varieties available. My family, husband and kids all like the toothpaste!! I will be making the switch!! Thanks Vocalpoint & Crest!!"
5.00,"I love this rinse, it didn't leave my mouth dry like other mouth washes do, it tasted great and left a very clean feeling in my mouth."
5.00,"the toothpaste have a great result i love the fresh and clean feeling"
5.00,"I loved the Crest whitening rinse. It makes your mouth feel very clean. My teeth are already whiter after 1 week!"
5.00,"My boyfriend and I both enjoyed the mouthwash. It has now became an item we both use daily and even plan on continuing to purchase and use. Thanks Crest!"
5.00,"I like the clean fresh taste, my teeth look terrific now!"
5.00,"This product made my mouth feel clean and fresh for awhile. It didn't burn. I was just concerned because there are many parabens in the ingredients."
5.00,"Loved the toothpaste. This left my mouth feeling very clean! Like it so much that,I believe, we have found our new favorite toothpaste. Thank you! =)"
5.00,"I love Crest products. I use Crest toothpaste and oral rinse. Especiallly the rinse. The taste is better than other brands. I also think Crest toothpaste is better than other brands."
5.00,"I love the way my teeth feel clean after using this product!"
4.00,"What I liked about this product is the flavor of the toothpaste - not overly minty like a lot of other brands out there. I liked that it actually felt more gentle on my gums, but didn't sacrifice any of that clean feeling after you brush. The only thing I didn't like was that it didn't have much whitening power."
1.00,"I tried this toothpaste a few months ago as my dentist included it in the \"goody bag\" after my cleaning. I don't care for the smell of this toothpaste, and I find the taste is very odd--almost fishy. So far the only Crest product that I have used and liked is the original blue anti-cavity toothpaste. This particular toothpaste didn't seem to clean very well, and it left a weird burning feeling in my mouth for hours. I threw away the sample after two uses because it was just too unsatisfactory. I will stick to the toothpastes that I like from now on. I cannot recommend this or any of the Crest Pro-Health products that I have tried. It seems like this line of products has a lot of problems and always makes my mouth hurt--and I am a stickler for oral hygiene. I don't have any cavities or gum problems, I brush at least 3-4 times a day, floss 2 times per day, use mouthwash, waterpik, etc. So my mouth is very clean and should theoretically not be affected by products that are deemed \"safe\" by the FDA. Yet every time I try a Pro-Health product, something bad always happens! You can read my reviews of two of the Pro-Health mouthwashes I have tried. Please save yourself a lot of pain--do not use Crest's Pro-Health line."
5.00,"this toothpaste gives you a great cleaning. the taste is a little odd, something to get used to and it feels a little gritty while brushing but your whole mouth feels refreshed and extra clean after brushing. and the clean feeling lasts a long time. I like this product a lot."
4.00,"My teeth felt clean and the flavor of the toothpaste was nice. I would probably purchase this again."
4.00,"I liked this toothpaste. It did seem to make my teeth feel cleaner and the taste wasn't too bad at all."
4.00,"The Crest Pro-Health toothpaste was wonderful. It was great tasting and left my mouth feeling clean and fresh."
1.00,"If you are at all prone to tartar buildup, beware of this Crest toothpaste. It contains Stannous fluoride that can cause surface staining of the teeth. It says so right on the label. It happened to me - the stains came off with a professional dental cleaning. After calling Procter & Gamble, they confirmed that the product can cause staining in some people. It just depends on your chemistry - of course, it doesn't affect everyone the same. But they did say that if you are prone to tartar buildup to stay away from it and other products with Stannous Fluoride. Switching back to another Crest toothpaste with sodium fluoride."
5.00,"I liked the Crest Pro-Health Clinical toothpaste. It has a minty taste that's not too strong. My teeth have that freshly polished feeling without the grit."
1.00,"This whitening product stained my teeth brown. Flavor was fine, but it made my tongue feel funny after use. My teeth started to look brown after a few uses, so I figured I should brush and use the mouthwash more, since something was clearly wrong. Of course, it made the problem worse. I threw out the whole bottle, and I recommend you do the same. Not worth it."
5.00,"It made my mouth feel extremely clean. The flavor lasted awhile. I love it when I can walk around and not worry about if my teeth have really been cleaned or not."
2.00,"Guess I am old school. I like the burn. Not only did I miss the burn it left a funny after taste. sorry :("
5.00,"The mouthwash was refreshing and made my teeth and mouth feel great. Absolutely awesome product by a household name you can trust."
5.00,"Love this product! It makes my mouth feel so clean for so long after I use it. It feels like I have just been to the dentist."
5.00,"This is the best toothpaste You can buy. It makes Your mouth feel great. It is good for keeping Your Gums Healthy. I wouldn't use anything else!! Highly recommend this toothpaste!!"
5.00,"I have tried several of your Clinical Pro line of products. I have not been disappointed. I really like the new plaque control because I am 57 years old and controlling plaque as we age is a problem. Would buy again."
5.00,"As someone else pointed out in a review here, this kind of thing is hard to \"truly\" review. Because the claim of this specific kind of toothpaste is the kind that I can't properly examine and spell out in a review here on Amazon.com. I'm 47 when I write this, and while I'm not the target age, I'm close. So I thought I'd take a look at this. I figure it can't HURT, right? Some of the things it says it helps with are \"Tooth Sensitivity - Weak Enamel - Tender, Inflamed Gums - Surface Stains\". As I'm a lifetime coffee drinker, the stains issue piqued my interest. Plus, I am getting older, so I figure the other issues could become But for this review, how do you say \"OK, this toothpaste works better for inflamed gums and weak enamel\" over more 'conventional' versions of toothpaste? You really can't. I have to assume they're not just lying about it being different, and there is SOME difference in that paste that helps address those things, and for that reason I was intersted in the product. Taste of things is a highly subjective issue, but for me, this didn't taste like that typical taste toothpaste is like. Given my age, I remember when all toothpastes were essentially the same - they all tasted awful. This one isn't like that. It's not like it's going to taste like a 5 star restaurant cooked dinner mind you - it is toothpaste (heh), but overall the taste was good, and not \"Oh man, I hate doing this, it tastes awful\". So if you're over 50, and use Crest brand toothpastes already, this should be a no brainer. Again, it's hard to PROVE in a review like this that the addtl age related dental claims are met, but I have to assume they're being helped by using this toothpaste, though."
3.00,"I appreciate the opportunity to try new products, such as toothpaste! This product works well and tastes great over all."
5.00,"I can't believe that Crest stopped making this product. It was the best toothpaste and now I am using one of their competitors toothpastes because none of the other Crest products can do the same job as Pro-Health Night."
5.00,"Great tasting mouthwash. Great addition to my periodontal maintenance."
5.00,"Definitely recommend this product. Does as advertised."
5.00,"This toothpaste is great! I loved how it left my mouth feeling fresh and clean."
5.00,"This is the best of both worlds ... leaves your mouth feeling exceptionally clean and fresh, and is great for your teeth! Will purchase again!"
5.00,"I loved the way this made my teeth feel after brushing. However the price is a bit too rich for my blood."
5.00,"this product left my mouth and teeth feeling clean and my breath fresh. i will definitely purchase it again."
5.00,"My husbands only wants to use Crest and we are both really impressed with the Pro health line. It cleans good and reduces gum problems."
5.00,"We love this toothpaste. It is the only one we use!"
5.00,"Wonderful product! I loved the taste and feel of the product. I just wish it was a little more affordable because I feel it's kind of expensive."
4.00,"Great product, I highly recommend it. Clean fresh feeling after rinsing."
5.00,"The Crest Pro Health line of products continues to impress me. Our dentist reccommended this brand for my husband and he's used it exclusively since."
3.00,"I cannot get past the terrible taste this toothpaste has. It last in my mouth way too long. Ewww..."
5.00,"I used the Crest Pro Health plaque control, and I was really impressed when I was rushing one morning and didnt have time to brush, just mouthwash and out the door, you know how you run your tongue across your teeth, well I happened to do that and felt no plaque as if I had brushed, with other toothpaste I dont get the same results.....5 stars!"
5.00,"I use both the toothpaste and mouthwash - have a clean feeling mouth all day."
1.00,"We picked this up thinking it must be like all other mouthwashes.....WRONG. After about 2 weeks of use, we started to notice big black and brown staining spots on our teeth that would not come off. We went to our dentist, and he said they have been seeing a lot of this problem and have been advising everyone to avoid this product. It is very harsh on your mouth environment and does terrible staining that can only be removed by the type of deep cleaning that dentists reserve for smokers. After a cleaning that took 1 hour longer than normal and unpleasant blasting of my teeth, the stains were able to be removed, so they were not permanent."
5.00,"Feels just like you've been at the dentist. Great Product!"
5.00,"This stuff is seriously good. It actually makes your whole mouth clean."
5.00,"I loved using the toothpaste. I like the flavor and the way my mouth felt after using it for a long time!"
5.00,"I've read some reviews where folks say they've expereinced problems with their teeth being stained but I have not experienced this myself. In fact, I have awoken the next morning to be surprised that I can taste the clean taste of the \"night\" version still. I think this a solid toothpaste to be using every evening."
5.00,"I have diabetes and continually battle gum issues. This product has helped my gums stay cleaner and healthier than with any other product I have tried. I will be continuing to use this toothpaste."
5.00,"i love this toothpaste! will continue to use and will suggest that others try it."
4.00,"Leaves your mouth feeling clean and fresh. Is just a bit to strong for the kids to enjoy. I did not mind the flavor as much as the kids. The product is a little pricey."
4.00,"The toothpaste does leave a very clean feeling and I like the taste."
5.00,"Seriously fresh and clean feeling after brushing with this toothpaste. The feeling also lasted much longer than with my regular toothpaste."
5.00,"I loved how clean my teeth felt and how they kept that clean feeling throughout the day."
5.00,"I've been using this for over a week now. It makes my teeth feel so clean and smooth! I even like the look of the toothpaste - it's pretty!"
4.00,"The Crest Pro-Health Clinical Rinse worked great and really did leave my mouth feeling clean and fresh. The price is fair for the quality of product your getting. I do have a few things I didn't care for at all though being that it foams up A LOT so if you take an average swig you end up with a mouthful of foam in seconds and it is alcohol free but it still burns quite a bit for what I'm used to in alcohol-free mouthwashes. Other than that I did like it and will most likely continue to use it. Compared to the other Pro-Health mouthwashes I do like this one better."
5.00,"Great product!"
5.00,"This toothpaste left my teething feeling clean and wasn't overly minty or overly pastey. It left my teeth feeling polished and clean."
4.00,"I love the fresh feeling this toothpaste leaves behind! I have also noticed that morning breath is not as bad when you brush with this at night!"
4.00,"I really liked using this product! It made me feel really clean and fresh. Even after eating onion rings!I will buy it again!"
3.00,"It cleaned my teeth well and my breath felt fresh. I dont know that it's any better than another toothpaste."
4.00,"Good taste and leaves my mouth feeling really clean!"
4.00,"The best advise I can give anyone it to try this product out. Because the flavor it not overpowering it leaves your mouth with a squeaky clean feeling and feeling fresh and healthy. On the negative side I found that the toothpaste left a messy residue that accumulated around the inner cap. I had to keep cleaning this off so that the cap would close properly."
5.00,"I love the mouthwash, its really amazing. I would recommend this product for everyone. I use it every morning and before i go to bed. Leaves my mouth feeling fresh and minty."
4.00,"This is the only mouthwash my family and I will use. It has relatively few ingredients, doesn't contain anything objectionable (beyond the \"[artificial] flavor\"), and works well. Our only complaint is that it's excessively foamy - similar to the effect of wearing whitening trays."
4.00,"It left my teeth feeling clean and the taste was not overwhelming. The price could've been a little less, but all in all it was a good product."
5.00,"This mouthwash tastes great and leaves my mouth fresh and clean without the medicine taste and burn of the competitor. Thank you for letting me try it. Goodbye Listerine! I'll be buying this product from now on."
2.00,"In my case the foaming did not bother me. That is probably because, knowing there was hydrogen peroxide in it, I rinsed my mouth twice after using it. However, I noticed that if I failed to rinse my white sink thoroughly after spitting it out, in the morning there were brown stains. I could get them off the porcelain fairly easily but that combined with the staining reports of other reviewers is enough evidence to look elsewhere for an alcohol-free mouthwash. In my opinion, it is downright stupid of a manufacturer to market a product that they know stains teeth, saying as they do here, \"In some cases, antimicrobial rinses may cause surface staining to teeth. This is not permanent or harmful, and may be prevented by adequate brushing or removed at your next dental visit.\" People who care about their appearance do not want filthy-looking teeth, even temporarily. Some may attempt to scrape off the offending film (which is probably oxidized plaque that inevitably forms on some surfaces even with good brushing) and in so doing, damage the enamel of their teeth. Proctor & Gamble gives you 60 days in which you can get a refund if not satisfied. In this case I bought ahead so as to not run out (don't most people?), so I'm out of luck there."
4.00,"The product left my teeth and mouth feeling really clean. It left no film on my teeth. It could be a little more reasonably priced."
5.00,"I have always been a loyal crest user and this product did not disappoint. My teeth felt so clean and fresh after using. I was impressed!!"
5.00,"I love the fresh healthy feeling with the Crest Pro Health rinse. It's helped keep mouths at our house healthy as well as fresh."
1.00,"I didn't have any problem with the toothpaste itself, but unless you make sure the cap is all the way on, (which my boyfriend never does) your bathroom sink will be COVERED in toothpaste soon!  It's too runny I guess and it just oozes out of the cap until there is nothing left.  I thought maybe it was a defective one, but I bought it in a 2-pack and the second tube was the same exact way.  Between the 2 tubes of toothpaste I probably used a quarter of one of them, and the rest ended up all over my counter."
3.00,"This tooth paste is good and works well. My teeth used to get sensitive from time to time and using Crest Pro Health toothpaste stopped that right away. The one thing you need to know about this tooth paste is that it is much much stronger (higher percentage of alcohol and peroxide)forumla compared to other tooth paste. Meaning that is you use to much you can get chemical burn in your mouth (sloughing off of the skin in you mouth) It happened to me many times when I used to much of it, eventually i found the right amount where it no longer is happened it just took a week or so of using it. Overall it is a good toothpaste you just need to use it in correct amounts to avoid damaging the skin in your mouth."
5.00,"I was completely unfamiliar with this product before I tried it, and was very pleased with the way it tastes, works, and the fresh after effect feeling in my mouth when I was done. My teeth did not turn brown (or any other color), nothing bad happened to my taste buds, and I can tell you after using Listerine Cool Mint for years that this product is much better in every way. I even tried Listerine's Total Care, and it can't compare to Crest Pro-Health Complete either. Thank you, CREST for developing and making available a great product, and please continue to keep CREST Pro-Health Complete mouthwash on the market."
5.00,"My teeth felt clean and polished after using. What a great feeling to have everyday."
5.00,"This was a fantastic product. Left my teeth feeling clean and fresh."
3.00,"I did not get the feeling that my teeth were completely clean after using this product. Seems to have a 'film' on my clean that really bothered me."
5.00,"This keeps my mouth feeling fresh and clean for most of the day."
1.00,"This toothpaste will clean your teeth better than just about anything on the market. The problem is the isides of your cheeks will peel off in the process. It sounds like a made up side effect but it's real. It gets worse the longer you use the product. About 30 minutes or so after brushing this creepy slime will start collecting in your mouth, it is the top layer of cells on your gums and inside the cheeks. It's really gross and you will find you have to spit it out, it's thick and opaque and extremely unnerving. I wasn't sure if I was just having some freak reaction to it, so I did a google search and found hundreds of one star reviews on Amazon.com saying the exact same thing. Others had far more severe side effects than I did. I had half a tube left and I threw it out. It's a shame because it really does clean the teeth well. Use with caution, for me it isn't worth it."
4.00,"I've been using this mouth wash for weeks and haven't really noticed any staining on my teeth as the other reviewers observed. I do like this mouth wash simply because it does work fine for me as a mouth wash, freshening my breath, keeping my mouth clean. I like that it does not cause the burning sensation as it does not have alcohol in it. One thing I'm not in love with is the after-taste left in the mouth for a short while. It's not awful but does have a funny taste to it."
1.00,"I noted that this product's description says, \"In some cases, rinses may cause surface staining to teeth. 6 in 1 benefits. This is not permanent or harmful, and may be prevented by adequate brushing or removed at your next dental visit.\" So I began to use it and didn't check my teeth until about two weeks had gone by and all of a sudden I saw horrid unsightly black staining, not all over my teeth but mainly in the crevices. And mainly on the front bottom teeth. Upon closer inspection, I realized what had happened: Either by direct coloration or by an oxidative process, the plaque that had formed prior to my next cleaning was what had become stained. Yes, of course that will be removed at my next cleaning, which is coming up, but meanwhile some plaque formation is normal even with constant brushing and semi-annual cleaning. For that to develop an ugly black stain is unacceptable. I would like to use a mouth rinse product that contains fluoride but it won't be this one. I cannot recommend this. It makes no sense to sell a product that does this to teeth. Ugh!This is even dangerous because those of us who are concerned about appearance and proud of our carefully-kept smiles, will be tempted to scrape off all the visible stained plaque using a metal implement. And this process, done by an untrained person, may result in damage to the enamel of the teeth.The product's active ingredient is listed as Sodium Fluoride 0.0219% (0.01% w/v fluoride ion). The inactive ingredients are listed as water, glycerin, flavor, cetylpyridinium chloride, poloxamer 407, phosphoric acid, methylparaben, sodium saccharin, propylparaben, disodium phosphate, blue 1. Maybe someone out there whose specialty is organic chemistry would know where the culprit lies in this list of chemicals."
4.00,"I liked it, but will have to use it for a while longer before I can say for sure how I feel."
5.00,"This Crest toothpaste left my mouth refreshed and clean."
5.00,"Left my teeth feeling clean and fresh. Loved the flavor!"
5.00,"This product is great. It makes my teeth feel very clean while making them stronger. I recommend this product."
4.00,"Loved the flavor of this paste and over all clean feeling it left behind. Will be purchasing more in the future!"
4.00,"This toothpaste along with the toothbrush and mouthwash work great on plaque."
5.00,"I really liked how clean my teeth felt the morning after I used the crest pro health mouth wash. It took all the plaque off and helped keep it off."
5.00,"Love glide dental floss. It's the only floss that does not get caught in my teeth. I also love the minty flavor on the floss, it's a nice perk to flossing. I would recommend Glide as a good buy."
4.00,"So the description reads \"Twin Pack 8 Oz\" and I'm thinking \"what a great deal!\". What I got was two 4-oz tubes. NOT what I was expecting. Now I'm not so sure it was a great deal."
4.00,"Kept my mouth feeling clean and didn't burn using it!"
5.00,"Loved this toothpaste. I felt like I just had a dental cleaning!"
5.00,"The toothpaste is great at helping my mouth feel clean, I feel like my teeth are whiter too!"
5.00,"I loved the new products and the prices of it. It was convient to purchase. Love it!"
4.00,"I really liked this mouthwash it seemed to work really well and I can see myself making this purchase again in the future!"
5.00,"I love the fact that it doesn't burn. The taste could be better but it's nice."
4.00,"The product was great BUT so was the price! It might my teeth feel like I just left the dentists chair, but I am on a fixed income, and would not spend that money on toothpaste...Sorry!"
5.00,"My family loves this toothpaste and we never buy another kind. It leaves my mouth feeling clean and breath fresh. I have not notices a significant difference in appearance of my teeth in terms of whiteness but my dentist has informed me that generally toothpastes alone cannot whiten teeth without the use of strips or trays. This toothpaste helps in prolonging whiteness and fighting yellowing of teeth. Love the Crest brand!"
5.00,"This toothpaste has a very pleasant and mild flavor and seems to do a good job whitening teeth. One of the best-tasting toothpastes I've used."
5.00,"I have been using this product for awhile and it is great! Leaves mouth clean and fresh. Highly recommend!"
2.00,"I've bought the same toothpaste at the grocery store and it was darker in color and even the consistency seemed a bit different. My son is using it but I doubt I'll ever buy something like this online again."
3.00,"this product left my mouth feeling refreshed, renewed."
5.00,"This toothpaste has a nice, clean refreshing taste and seems to do the job on cleaning my low-maintenance teeth. I recommend it."
1.00,"Mouth doesn't feel as clean because there are no bubbles and it doesn't feel minty while brushing. The minty feeling comes after the brushing part. I like my toothpaste feeling minty during and after brushing."
5.00,"Love the fresh feeling it leaves in my mouth after using this toothpaste."
5.00,"My family loves the Crest Pro-Health Rinse. It does a great job of keeping plaque under control and leaves your mouth feeling fresh and clean."
1.00,"I normally use another type of Crest, but Crest Pro-Health was on sale and I wanted to try it. It is horrible! The month slime everyone talks about is gross yet so true. The toothpaste is too strong. This slime is actually a collection of cells the toothpaste has stripped from your mouth. This may sound cleaning, but it strips way too much and leave your mouth almost raw in spots. I didn't realize this toothpaste was causing all this until I went online to read reviews. Rinsing doesn't help. After you stop using it for a week, your mouth should return to normal. Also, I normally do not have bad breath, but I seemed to develop horrible breath after using this. It doesn't whiten well at all.I really can't say enough horrible things about it. I would never recommend this to anyone."
1.00,"After the first day of using this my skin was falling off my gums. Stupidly i kept using it and now Ive been tasting metal for a bout two weeks. I threw the toothpaste away. The skin stopped falling off because i think there was little skin left to fall off. This stuff is toxic. I do not know how it can be sold."
5.00,"With claque control it helps me get my teeth clean and keep them strong making me more assured for my next visit"
5.00,"I purchased this for my grand, but she is to young, so I used it instead. It tastes good, and is effective."
5.00,"I'm quite happy with this product. My teeth are whiter, my dentist said there is less plaque than the last time he saw me. I give it top props!"
4.00,"A great tasting mouth rinse that made my mouth feel like I just left the dentist. I got great results after continued use of the product."
4.00,"The flavor was surprisingly good considering how well this product worked. Usually the products that work well don't taste good."
5.00,"Crest products have always been the best but it is great to see Crest evolve with new products that continue to promote healthy teeth."
5.00,"After I brushed my teeth with this, I couldn't stop rubbing my tongue over my teeth. It made my mouth fill fresh and clean."
5.00,"All items received left my mouth feeling clean and fresh,"
5.00,"I love the fact that it does not burn. It leaves my mouth feeling clean and banishes the bad breath. Definitely would recommend it. Great product."
5.00,"Excellent product I like these new Crest specified tooth cleaning products. Love the gum one and the plaque one your teeth feel like you just got a cleaning."
3.00,"I tried the toothpaste and it wasn't any better or worse than what I use. I didn't like it as much as my regular brand, so I gave it to my son. He really likes it. I would probably not buy it again, because there are cheaper products that work just as well."
4.00,"I really like this toothpaste, it is gooey and falls off the toothbrush, but I love crest products & my 4yr old seems to enjoy brushing his teeth. It maybe the Jake & the neverland pirates too .. Haha.."
5.00,"I brush my teeth with this every night and I love crest products. I would use nothing else on my teeth!"
5.00,"I just used Crest Plaque Control toothpaste and my teeth felt cleaner and smoother! Just like after the dentist office! So fresh and healthy, is the only way to go."
5.00,"Teeth felt and looked super clean after using this!"
1.00,"I have been using this toothpaste for almost two months and I was on my forth tube before I had to quit. Ever since day one I noticed a white slimy substance after I brushed my teeth. I thought that it might be a normal effect from this type of toothpaste. I just discovered that the white substance is my oral mucosa after discussing my mouth complications with my doctor. Most of the inside of my mouth is red and sore and I have white and red bumps all over my tongue. They are very painful. My doctor said that my mouth was chemically burned from using this toothpaste."
4.00,"This toothpaste made my teeth look and feel really clean, and I like that it provides extra protection against plaque buildup"
3.00,"This mouthwash leaves my mouth feeling clean without the alcohol burn, which is nice. However, I find it hard to eat anything up to two hours later, as the taste lingers and lingers and lingers, and makes almost anything you put in your mouth taste disgusting. If that doesn't bother you, then this is great stuff."
1.00,"I have been using this exact mouthwash for about 5-6 months now. My dentist noticed that my gums (close to my teeth) were starting to turn brown but he said that it was strange because my gums and teeth are healthy, just discolored. Now, about a month ago, I started to notice brown staining on my teeth as well. The staining is behind my 4 front teeth and a few of my lower teeth close to my gums. I have stopped using the mouthwash, and have tried whitening products and they won't remove the stains. IF YOU DON'T WANT BROWN TEETH, DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT!!!"
5.00,"I have used the New Pro-Health Clinical products from Crest® and Oral-B mouthwash and have noticed a change in the whiteness of my teeth. I am a regular coffee drinker, and have noticed the dull color of my teeth. With regular usage of the New Pro-Health Clinical mouthwash, my teeth are noticeably whiter. My breath is also fresher"
5.00,"I have been a crest girl pretty much my whole life, never tried this product however. Was glas I got the chance. I like the flavor and how my mouth felt clean and fresh after using it. Will being buying more."
5.00,"My whole life I have always used Crest. I doubt that will ever change. I have tried free samples of other toothpastes, and they just don't leave my teeth feeling as clean or my breath as fresh as Crest. Sure, this may be some new and improved variety of Crest, but all that I really care about is that its Crest. I've been using it for about a week now, and it is not a letdown. The paste is very minty, and you don't need much to get the job done! I can't really say if it helps whiten your teeth more than any other toothpaste, but it certainty doesn't hurt I guess all I can really say is that if you see Crest you know its going to be good. I will also note that the prices Amazon charges for these types of products are usually outrageous. Drive to Target and buy them there!!"
5.00,"I have sensitive teeth and I prefer this product to a toothpaste like Sensodyne. It felt like it got my mouth cleaner."
5.00,"I tried this and my teeth felt very clean. I felt like I really had a good cleaning, my mouth was fresh tasting too. I will continue to use this product. My family felt the same way about it too."
5.00,"This is a nice smooth toothpaste. No stinging & leaves my mouth feeling so fresh."
5.00,"Dentists seem less than certain as to whether there is a significant difference among various toothpastes with respect to cavity and gum disease protection. Beyond the obvious - make sure you use a fluoride containing toothpaste - there seems to be little agreement as to whether the whitening claims, tartar development claims, or gingivitis claims translate to something meaningful in any one individual's mouth. So I generally choose toothpaste based upon other factors - taste is the primary issue here. Crest Pro-Health is a cross between gel (like Aim) and paste (like standard Crest). It has a pleasant taste, somewhat less strong than standard Crest but along the same lines, and a better than usual aftertaste that lasts for quite some time after a final rinse. There's a nice level of grittiness to the toothpaste, bringing it a little closer to what a dentist might use to assist with whitening, but not so gritty that you will lose a layer of enamel if used regularly. Foaming quality is good - not too much and not too little. This particular mixture is designed for consumers over 50 - those most likely to have gum disease or sensitive areas on their teeth - but it may well be of value to younger consumers who have been warned about receding gums. And of course, toothpaste being toothpaste, there's no harm in anyone over 12 using this product. In the Crest vs Colgate battle, I have a slight preference for the initial taste of the Colgate product, but this is more a Coke/Pepsi thing where your own perspective may be the opposite. Despite my preference for the Colgate taste, I like this product overall a little more than the equivalent Pro version of Colgate due to the longer lasting breath freshening quality as well as the feel of the gel/paste."
4.00,"I hate flossing cause my teeth are close together this works real good and i dont have to struggle to get my teeth clean.Love it will buy again!!!!"
5.00,"I found the Crest Clinical Mouthwash left me with fresh breath and the feeling I had truly finished the cleaning process."
4.00,"It tastes great, with a nice refreshing flavor that is not too overpowering. Great design and packaging."
5.00,"Your mouth feels like you have just left the dentist. We love the new Crest products!"
5.00,"This is the only toothpaste I'll use. I am not a fan of regular tasting mints toothpaste. The flavor stays with you. I have excellent check ups from my dentist."
4.00,"I bought it a couple of weeks ago and it left my mouth feeling very fresh!"
5.00,"At first, did NOT like the taste of this, but after seeing my teeth getting whiter, I can deal with the taste, because the results are worth it!!!"
4.00,"I really like how fresh and clean my mouth feels after useing this paste. but I'm really wishing that they had a formula for sensitive teeth as well..."
5.00,"I really liked this product not only did my breath smell better but it also whiten my teeth each time i used it. It was healing to my sentivie teeth. great product and reasonable price. will buy and use it more often."
5.00,"I really like Crest Pro Health mouthwash! While there may be some mouthwashes that are not as strong in taste, I have also found those to not work as well (on average). This product does the job, no alcohol sting, and so I can rinse longer instead of being in a hurry to spit it out! Now as to Preferred Mart...They seem to provide quite a few things for Amazon. This particular order arrived in time as promised. I have also had one order that was canceled with no chance for me to change or redirect my order. Preferred Mart where I know for sure they have been involved has a 50/50 chance, but again this is my experience."
5.00,"The new and highly improved Crest Pro toothpaste is every thing it claims to be and do. It not only leaves your mouth feeling healthy. It leaves your teeth whiter after each use. Crest Pro has made a believer out of me because I used the other brand. I liked the results Crest Pro was providing for my mouth and teeth. That I purchased Crest Pro mouthwash. Since using Crest Pro toothpaste and Crest Pro mouthwash I'm getting amazing comments from my dentist and friends. I would not hesitate to recommend these products. I'm so satisfied with the experience."
4.00,"I really love this toothpaste. It leaves your whole mouth feeling so clean."
4.00,"I enjoyed the minty taste! The abrasiveseness of the toothpaste was great=really made your teeth feel clean! Lasting benefits!"
5.00,"I loved the toothpaste! It leaves your mouth feeling extremely clean!"
5.00,"Makes your mouth feel very clean. Nice minty taste."
5.00,"I love Crest ProHealth. My gums are not as sensitive since I started using it."
4.00,"So I decided to use this because I have a new resolution for myself to thoroughly clean my teeth at least 1 time a day. I use it at night before I go to bed I did notice many of the symptoms the first couple of times of using it: lowered sense of taste and very strong flavor. However, once you work part way through the bottle it isn't such an intimidatingly strong flavor and it stops affecting your taste buds. After a month of use my teeth and gums are looking much healthier. As long as you are only using this product once a day at night time it should not affect how things taste the next day. A brand new bottle is always going to have a strong flavor at first. As long as you know that you can work through it and in the long run it'll benefit the health of you're mouth greatly. It's not much different than making your own mouth wash from hydrogen peroxide and water. The glycerin is what makes the white stuff on your teeth after you rinse with it. It's just there to help keep it on your teeth for longer it's an ingredient you will find if you want to make your own mouth wash or toothpaste. So as bad as it may seem at first, stick it out and you will be pleased."
5.00,"I tried the crest toothpaste and it was great. Teeth felt fresh and clean. Great value too. Will buy it again!"
5.00,"Fresh and clean feeling left in my mouth. Reasonably priced. Would buy again."
4.00,"I liked the way my teeth felt after brushing. They felt like I just came from the dentist's office. The price is a little expensive, but worth trying. The only downside for me was the aftertaste and that my mouth felt tingly."
5.00,"My family and I have been using Crest products for years. The Crest Pro Care Rinse is excellent. It makes my mouth feel and look fresh."
4.00,"I don't like to have a stinging sensation but I like fresh breath and this seems to do that job just fine."
4.00,"I liked the way my teeth felt after using this products noticable results after just a few uses :)"
4.00,"I like the taste and the flat snap cap. Our teeth feel clean after brushing. It seems to be a good Crest product."
5.00,"My mouth felt really clean and fresh after using this. I thought my teeth and gums had a really good cleaning."
5.00,"After using for a week, my teeth stayed smooth and clean feeling all day and were noticably whiter."
4.00,"When I use this toothpaste, my teeth feel clean. I also have fresh breath. Crest is a good quality, reliable product that you can always count on."
5.00,"I've always liked Crest. Clean Cinnamon is not too sweet or tart - it's just right. We can't find this flavor in our local stores."
5.00,"I loved the toothpaste. After I brushed my teeth felt really clean and fresh. I love that it helps keep plaque from coming back. I loved the fresh mint flavor. I also like that it is good for sensitive teeth."
4.00,"Has a great taste and a lasting flavor. Made my mouth feel clean and amazing. Would recommend and buy again."
4.00,"This product makes my teeth feel dentist fresh. It cetainly is easier to floss so must be gettinf rid of some plaque."
5.00,"This toothpaste left my mouth feeling really fresh and great after my using it. There was no weird after taste or anything like that. I definitely recommend this product to others!!"
5.00,"It tastes good, doesn't burn and leaves you with a great clean feeling. A great product!"
5.00,"Have seen positive effects on my teeth. Look forward to purchasing it again. Also like brushing now using this type of toothpaste."
4.00,"It is such a good idea to create a product that benefits your oral health in so many ways. Unfortunately I did not care for the taste."
5.00,"I have used this since it came out and have NO bad effects but all good . My gums and teeth sensitiveity could'nt be better! It's a great product so thank-you. Tastes great too!"
2.00,"It is a good product I trust but a little chalky and pricy~probably won't switch to this flavor"
4.00,"We always use Crest products and I usually use Crest Baking Soda & Peroxide Whitening. I saw this offered on vine and decided to give it a try. This toothpaste creates a very small bubble foam especially when compared to the peroxide paste. it's smooth mint flavor is less intense than the fresh mint flavor of the peroxide paste. The less intense flavor is the best part. I have desired a neutral flavored toothpaste forever and have never found one, so any toothpaste that have less flavor is better in my opinion. I still prefer my peroxide paste over this paste mainly because I like the way the peroxide paste foams way better than this paste. I received this product free of charge to try through the vine program. Would I spend my own money on this? No"
1.00,"After diligently using this product for nearly two months, I was shocked and appalled when I noticed brown stains near the gumline of my lower teeth. The stains appear to be tartar - something I've never had a problem with in my life. I can't believe that Crest is allowed to keep this product on the market."
5.00,"I always buy colgate products but after trying this , I am switching to Crest."
5.00,"I like this new product. It is fresh and tastes good. It leaves my teeth feeling refreshed and no grit left behind."
5.00,"Plaque has always been an ongoing issue and this toothpaste had a clean, fresh feel like you have after using mouthwash"
1.00,"!BROWN STAINING! Started using CrestProHealth months ago. I began noticing embarrassing brown build-up. Couldn't wait to go for 6mos dental cleaning. The hygienist noticed the unusual staining too...and asked me if I might be using Crest Pro Health rinse!?! I replied yes. We'll never buy any Crest products again!"
5.00,"I have been using this product for awhile now. I am on my second tube and tonight I was brushing and noticed that a spot on my tooth that had been very sensitive suddenly wasn't bothering me anymore! So I stopped and looked at my gums and noticed they looked healthy and pink! I have suffered with gingivitis, tooth sensitivity, bleeding and plaque build up for some time now, and I have to say this toothpaste has been amazing! I have NO issues from it like some of these reviews claim. This is also the first review I have ever written and after seeing all the crazy negative reviews, I have to say that the negative reviews seem ridiculous and I can't believe they are true! Especially the most ridiculous one left by the user claiming the product had to have been made by Satan and caused Leprocy?!?!?              To sum up:              This toothpaste is great! I have ZERO side effects and it actually does what it says!              Highly recommend this product if you are having gum issues!!!              Source: Stay at Home Mom of 2"
5.00,"The new Crest ProHealth Clinical toothpaste is awesome. It leaves your mouth fresh feeling with no bad aftertaste and it is also great for helping control plaque. My dental hygienist said it really makes a difference!"
5.00,"My husband recently had braces put on and they drive him crazy. He constantly brushes his teeth and uses mouthwash. This tootpaste and mouthwash has really helped his mouth feel clean and fresh. It is strong enough to do the job without the alcohol burn. The flavor is good also."
5.00,"i love the new crest clinical line the mouthwash the toothpaste it's great.Leaves you with a fresh clean feeling all day"
1.00,"I didn't have problems with staining or numbness, but put made my gums and the insides of my cheeks peel. They healed as soon as I threw out the toothpaste. Not recommended."
5.00,"This tastes great and keeps your mouth fresh. The whole family loves it."
4.00,"this product makes my mouth have a clean and fresh sensation longer."
5.00,"I tried Crest Pro Health and it was Great. It left my mouth fresh and clean and my dentist also recommends it!"
5.00,"I have used various Crest products before, but definitely like this rinse. It helps to keep my teeth feeling cleaner longer and keeps my breath fresh as well. It helps to get those hard-to-reach spots, and my checkups have been great!"
5.00,"I'm always looking for products that leave my teeth clean and my breath fresh for longer than just a few minutes. This toothpaste does both! My new toothpaste!"
5.00,"I love the Crest Pro Health Whitening-there is no tartar buildup and my gums are healthy after using it for 3 years.                                                                     Dentists probably do not like it because it destroys germs and there are no cavities."
5.00,"I used this rinse and it was unbelievable the cleaning action! Similar but gentler than peroxide, so one needs to 'brush' their tongue to remove the foam. I also used this after when ever I ate after oral surgery and was amazed at the gentle cleaning action."
5.00,"I always hated that pebbly feeling of plaque on my teeth. Since using Crest Pro Health toothpaste, my teeth feel smooth and clean."
5.00,"Refreshing product that makes your teeth feel clean!"
5.00,"Excellent product. I have used Crest Clinical before and really liked it. The plaque control is new but I don't understand how it is different from the Gum Protection which I normally use. The active ingredients are identical and the inactive ingredients are the same with minimal difference, the plaque control has one different color ingredient plus iron oxide. I like the taste and the way my teeth feel after using it."
5.00,"The Crest toothpaste I tried was awesome. Great !!!"
5.00,"the mouthwash works well. leaves a clean feeling and tastes good."
4.00,"I love this toothpaste. The flavor is amazing. It is like brushing your teeth with wintergreen breath mints. I love that it helps my teeth not be so sensitive. I actually find myself looking forward to brushing my teeth because I love the flavor & it works!"
4.00,"The price and product was a great buy and find on Amazon. I recommend this purchase with a very good rating. But, the price should be a little less."
5.00,"I hadn't been to the dentist in 2 years and in that time, I'd managed to get pregnant twice. I got the Ob's okay to go the dentist and was told it would take $400 to fix my mouth. I needed a \"deep cleaning\" because of my pregnancy induced gingivitis. I also had 7 cavities from the morning sickness. I didn't have the money so I left without getting any cleaning and sobbed all the way home.I needed to do something, so I went to Wal-Mart to get a new toothbrush and saw this toothpaste. It said money back guarantee so I tried it. Did wonders. My gums no longer look raw. Even when I stopped flossing, my gums still looked great. Felt great. No film or soreness like others are saying. My husband also tried it and loves it. Today, we bought a tube for my stepdaughter because she has gingivitis as well (13...hates to brush...pretty normal). Hopefully it works for her too"
4.00,"Was a good value for the money, and it left my mouth feeling clean."
5.00,"I loved the new Pro-Health Clinical toothpaste from Crest. It has made my teeth feel cleaner and fresher breath too. I love it. I am telling all my friends and family about it."
3.00,"I honestly didn't notice much of anything special. It works as well as you'd expect a quality toothpaste to perform."
5.00,"feels good on my teeth, the bristles werent too hard"
4.00,"I have been a regular Crest user for years but this new Pro-Health line definitely offers more than the regular toothpaste. I can tell the difference in my teeth after only a short time. They just feel like their getting a more thorough, deeper clean."
2.00,"I didn't finish using my 3 pack of this stuff because my teeth only felt smooth for about 10 hrs. after brushing and I'm used to them staying smooth and clean until the night or 18 hours. I went back to the regular crest and then to colgate. Now my mouth stays clean again. Don't bother with this stuff. It must kill healthy bacteria or something I don't know."
5.00,"Since my 8 year old daughter found out from the dentist that she had 2 small cavities, we started using this on top of her normal brushing routine. She likes this better than the bubble gum flavor brand. She just squeezes some liquid into the top compartment then pours into cap and swishes. Easy peazy"
3.00,"Prior to using Crest Pro Health Complete, I had been using Crest Pro Health Multi-Protection and I could not taste or notice any difference between the two with the exception they have two different caps where Complete has the kind of child lock that you have to push in to twist. The biggest difference is in the labeling, sure they both promise to freshen breath, have no burn of alcohol (which they do), but where Multi-Protection also claims to kill germs, reduce plaque, help prevent gingivitis, and keep teeth cleaner longer, despite being labeled \"complete\" the Complete version does none other these but does claims ton rebuild enamel, help prevent cavities, clean teeth and gums, and kill bad breath germs. I guess if you want a truly \"complete\" mouthwash, you will have to buy both products and alternate them every other day."
4.00,"Like the whole line quite a bit, but it is a it pricey."
5.00,"Absolutely loved it !!! Made my mouth feel fresh and clean. Will definitely purchase again."
5.00,"Love this stuff a lot, love the grit and the flavor. Make my mouth feel fresh and clean. Keep it coming."
5.00,"love the mouthwash. made my teeth feel clean & breath fresh all day."
5.00,"My husband and I love this stuff, what a great taste and no alcohol. Very clean!!!"
5.00,"This mouthwash is my new favorite. It provides a good clean feel and the breath-freshening power lasts for a long time."
4.00,"I've been happy with all the Crest Pro-Health stuff I've tried. These toothpastes seem to really make my gums happier, especially if I haven't used Pro-Health in a while (I do tend to buy what's on sale!) and they've gotten a little sensitive. Whereas some pastes have a very strong flavor, and I sort of get the sense that they have to in order to keep your mouth feeling fresh, this paste has a mild flavor that doesn't knock your socks off. And it still feels fresh for quite some time, so as far as that's concerned, I like this stuff a lot. It's hard to say whether the \"clinical\" benefits of this particular paste work or not; usually they only aid in preventing bad things, rather than magically replacing your dentist. Also, unless you get this product on sale, it's a little expensive."
3.00,"While I didn't really care for the flavor of the rinse, it left a tingly clean feeling in my mouth and seemed like it will really do a good job saying what it is supposed to."
4.00,"This made my mouth feel fresh and clean. This is a worthy product."
3.00,"I was not impressed with the mouthwash as the taste was not to my liking."
3.00,"I have tried several of the Crest Pro-Health toothpastes now and have learned that I am not a fan at all. This particular toothpaste is better than the other Pro-Health toothpastes that I have tried but I am still not impressed. This toothpaste is dark blue and has a consistency that is more like toothpaste that I would use. However it has the typical Pro-Heath taste that I don't like. There must be something in the Pro-Health product line that makes it taste gross. I don't feel like it cleans my teeth as good as other toothpaste and it doesn't freshen my breath as well either. In addition I have noticed a slightly dry mouth after using it and tender gums and the roof of my mouth. After I noticed the toothpaste was bothering me I did some research online I found out that a lot of people are having problems with them. It has caused serious staining to teeth as the warning on the box says. It has also caused a lot of people mouth pain and it really doesn't sound like a product that they should continue manufacturing. I am open minded and will continue using it unless it causes me some type of serious problems. But I am quite certain that I will not purchase this toothpaste. I love Crest in general and have been loyal to the brand all my life but the Pro-Health product is not good in my opinion. I will stick with the Crest 3D toothpastes that I love so much."
5.00,"Wow wee I loved using all 4 of these products. Start out with the floss, it smells good and it leaves a good feeling after using it. Then use the large mouth toothbrush. The toothbrush feels so amazing, I find myself using it a few times a day! I love how the toothpaste has little bits of freshener in it. The mouthwash is the last part of this wonderful time taking care of my mouth and teeth. The mouthwash has little bits of goodness in it too. All of my family uses the mouthwash, and after you use it, it just makes you smile! Which is awesome, because your smile is beautiful!! Thanks Crest, I know I will be buying all these products. And for the prices, it is a really good deal! Nothing is too expensive when taking care of your mouth and teeth!!"
3.00,"Has a few toxic things in it, but it's what my husband prefers. I guess if it didn't it would not be Crest."
5.00,"The right toothpaste does make a difference. I go longer than suggested between dental cleanings and this toothpaste will help me keep my plaque under control until my next appointment. It didn't burn my mouth and has a good flavor. It also doesn't stain your teeth and helps to keep them white."
5.00,"I used to go to the dentist every 4 months for check-ups. After using this for about a year, I've been put back on the 6-month plan, and I'm excited"
5.00,"It made my mouth feel clean and fresh all day! I really liked the minty taste. My teeth felt clean even after eating."
1.00,"My children had a very hard time pumping the toothpaste out of this tube. I ended up having to do it for them each time, not worth the money."
4.00,"I've always been a fan of Crest so I trust most of their varieties right off the bat. This particular kind was no different. A good smooth texture that leaves a pleasant after-taste in my mouth. My only complaint with this product is that it is a bit runny. I would have given it a full amount of starts if it was thicker and didn't melt down the minute it hit my toothbrush."
1.00,"This is the worst mouthwash I have ever used. I bought some from CVS and thought it would be great because of the 'clinical' name. Turns out, all it does is burn. My mouth is still burning as we speak. Avoid this mouth wash at all costs! I don't know how to make the burning stop!"
3.00,"After using this once a day for 3 days, EVERYTHING started to taste like soap. I wait at least 4 hours after use before I eat or drink anything but water (even though it says 30min) and it STILL tastes like soap as if it burnt my taste buds. Took 2 days after stopping before I could taste right again. It makes your breath fresh but any other mouthwash can do that without burning off your taste buds and ruining every meal and snack for you :("
1.00,"I started using crest pro health because my dentist told me that listerine stains teeth. I never noticed my teeth stained before until I started using Crest Pro health. I've only been using it for 2 months and I immmediately saw brown staining in between my teeth. It's horrifying and embarrassing. I don't recommend any crest pro health produces to anyone! STAY AWAY"
5.00,"Best mouth wash. No Stingy Burny feel. However I don't feel like I just came home from the Dentist Clean, But it's close!"
5.00,"I am very pleased with the Crest Clinical for healthy gums toothpaste. My dental appt. indicated my gum health had improved. I definitely will buy this toothpaste."
4.00,"I love the feeling after brushing with this toothpaste."
4.00,"Really cleans your teeth like a polish. Great taste, too."
4.00,"I have been using Crest Pro-Health mouthwash for the most part over the last couple years and have had a clean bill of health from the dentist ever since I have started so it must be doing something right. I really enjoy the fresh taste to this mouthwash, it is not overpowering and leaves my mouth feeling good for the next couple hours (like most mouthwashes, you want to avoid eating and drinking for a couple hours after using because it will distort the taste). Like most Crest mouthwash bottles, my only complaint is a small one, I wish the cap would have measurements in it so I know how much to take every time. But I do like the extra large bottle which will last a long time before having to buy more."
5.00,"Love this toothpaste. Cleans well and left my mouth feeling clean and fresh. I will continue to use this toothpaste."
4.00,"Hi, I get the slimy mouth like everybody else who uses this product and I don't like it. However, I keep using it because my 6-month check ups have never been better. Hardly any plaque equals = hardly any unpleasant scraping at my appointment. My dental hygienist was really impressed and SHE started using this product. I guess my mouth isn't quite as sensitive as some others - I don't get the peeling interior - and the slime is a drag, but I've kept at it the past 2 years because of the results. It seems to me as if the slime coats the teeth overnight and prevents decay and plaque forming. Icky? Yes. Does it work? Yes. Worth it? For now!"
5.00,"Definitely a better deal for me to buy this way as oppose the the warehouse store. Seems to work fine (no complaints from dentist). It's not as firm as toothpaste normally is but still does the trick.Just be aware and don't turn the brush or it will all slide off."
3.00,"This toothpaste is too strong. It does a good job, but, if I brush with it too long (more than 1.5 minutes) then I'll have some stripped mouth lining the next day; therefore, I'm only using it for short brushes, and everyother day, etc."
5.00,"I really enjoyed using this product! It made my teeth feel super clean."
5.00,"The crest prorinse is great. It has no alcohol, and a very pleasant taste. I would recommend it to anyone."
4.00,"It tastes good, and makes my teeth feel like they have been professionally cleaned."
4.00,"What can I say...its a toothpaste...I don't know if its doing its job or not...but my 3 year old likes it and right now thats what its all about..."
4.00,"I like it. It cleans my mouth and keeps it feeling fresh for a long time."
5.00,"Teeth felt great after using this product. Sparkly clean. Great toothpaste!"
5.00,"Good product made my teeth feel clean. Taste not great"
1.00,"I have to agree with many other reviewers here. I bought a bottle of this stuff about six months ago and used it for a few days and found that it affected the way food tasted. Put it away and then decided to try it again and have used it for the past four days and cannot taste my food! Haven't been eating because nothing tastes right (or doesn't have any taste at all). There should be something on the bottle about his because I have used many, many kinds of mouthwashes and NONE of them have ever done this to my mouth. SUGGESTION: Use this product if you want to lose weight because it will definately take the pleasure out of eating!"
5.00,"My mouth felt fresh and clean after using. Would definitely recommend!"
5.00,"someone can me a trial size tube of this for free so after i went to the dentist and found out i had 7 cavities, needed a root canal and had horrible tartar build up that only a dentist could remove, i got my root canal done and figured well i might as well try it. the first time i used this stuff over 50% of the tartar was removed on the back of my 2 front teeth, i was shocked. it hasnt removed the tartar close to the gumline yet,but i have only used it 3 times now, and havent noticed any foaming, staining, mucous stuff at all. all i noticed was to me the cinnnamon was strong and burned a little bit on the inside of my mouth. after seeing how much of that tartar was removed, and i mean it was BADDDDDDD! i will keep using this. i should have been using this along time ago maybe i wont have such a mess that i have. im hoping it will help with the gingivitis and the start of periodental disease too."
5.00,"tastes very good so i really like it."
4.00,"This was excellent mouthwash as far as cleaning my mouth goes. I wasn't totally thrilled with the taste though."
5.00,"Wish I knew why Crest discontinued making this toothpaste. Would be nice to know if any of their newer toothpastes are similar to Crest Night."
4.00,"I am Crest-girl. Always have been. Always will be! I found this formulation to have an extensive array of attributes for oral health. I've used this toothpaste with a manual toothbrush and an electric toothbrush -- both with great results and a clean smooth feeling."
4.00,"I liked the product. It made my teeth feel smooth and clean.Leaves your breath fresh too."
5.00,"I bought the gum protection version of the toothpaste for my husband, whose last checkup had identified gum issues. After using this toothpaste for a few months, his next checkup was great and his gums were normal!"
5.00,"This made my teeth and mouth feel so clean. I love this toothpaste!"
4.00,"Consider it as Medication. It is not for everybody.I dislike its strong taste, and peeling skin in my mouth (I use a little less than other pastes).Having said that, it seems to do wonders for our mild gum problems.I had a dental abscess from about 3 years ago.After some serious and expensive cleaning, the abscess was gone in weeks.But the abscess left my tooth very sensitive.Basically any food molecules broken down in my mouth, I'd feel it.I'm talking about any food or drink with calories.It got better ever-so-slightly every month for the past 30 months, as enamel gets re-plastered on my tooth.Until enamel recovers, I am brushing 4 times a day plus strong salt gargle before I go to bed.If I don't brush within 5-7 hours of eating anything, I'd feel slight pressure (not quite pain) where the abscess was.That \"pressure\" used to come in 10 minutes after eating anything.Then 1 hour, then 2, now it's 5-7 hours, over the period of past 30 months.Apparently rebuilding enamel takes a long time.In the mean time, I have to fight off germs.Some tooth paste would leave not much after-taste, and I'd feel it in my molar later.This Godzilla of a toothpaste, has monstrous aftertaste.But it seems to keep germs in check better than any other toothpaste.My wife is an obsessive flosser.There are some gaps between her molars. So she flosses after every meal.Her gums used to bleed every time she flossed. After we've gone through our first tube, she said that her gums would bleed every other times.Now that we are on the third tube, she says that there is almost no bleeding from flosses.We have some problems with our gums.So this toothpaste has been working fine for us.Would I use it if I didn't have gum problem?Probably not.It tastes too strong, but inside of my mouth peeling off does not happen anymore (I use less in quantity, but my wife uses same quantity).But since I am recovering from an abscess, it's been good medication for me (and for my wife).I'm considering it as over-the-counter medication for people who are recovering from gum diseases.(of course, if you do have a gum disease, you must go see a dentist first!)I'm stocking up this toothpaste so we can have a year's worth of supply, just in case it gets discontinued."
5.00,"great taste and excellent results! it is a little pricey but the results are worth it if you can afford it."
1.00,"That is how badly this product stained my teeth. I had some buildup of brown stains over time while using this product, but the real shock was when my lower teeth became stained dark brown in a single day. Ran into a dental office that afternoon because I was so freaked out. The dentist first did an X-ray to make sure my teeth hadn't *died.* Because that's how bad they looked. Thanks, Crest. I'm done with your products now."
4.00,"I've been using this toothpaste for about a week now. It has a good taste and leaves my mouth feeling very clean. It will take a while to see if there are any permanent results and I hope I see a difference."
1.00,"Nevermore!! :("
5.00,"I HAVE TO WRITE THIS TO REPORT MY EXPERIENCE WITH THIS PRODUCT. I HAVE USED IT FOR THREE YEARS WITH NO SIDE EFFECTS OR STAINS OR LOSS OF TASTE...AT ALL. I originally bought this product at Costco here in Los Angeles---used it for three years with none of the effects mentioned in some other \"reviews\". Then this week I ran out so I went to Costco to buy some more. None of it was at Costco so I purchased Scope with about 14% alcohol. THE SCOPE WITH THE ALCOHOL BURNED MY TONGUE!!! So, I ordered the Crest, this product under review, from Amazon as Costco doesn't carry it anymore. That's when I realized that SCOPE BURNS MY TONGUE!!! UGGG...I HATE TO HAVE MY TONGUE FEEL LIKE IT IS BURNING!!! That's my honest experience with the product. Of course I can't guarantee you will have the same experience that I had..but this is my honest experience with the product."
3.00,"leaves an aftertaste in the mouth"
5.00,"My entire family enjoyed trying this product. Thanks for the opportunity."
1.00,"I started using this toothpaste last night and have been so freaked out by what has happened that I decided to do some research. I've so far brushed 4 times with this toothpaste and after each time I notice that there's stringy mucous in my mouth. It really startled me; it wasn't like any mucous I'd had before and I was worried it may have been a worm or something coming up from out of my stomach. So I decided to check online to see if it might be the toothpaste causing it. If you check out the reviews for the regular Crest Pro Health Toothpaste, Clean Mint, you'll see a ton of reviews all stating that they've experienced what I've been experiencing. Apparently, the toothpaste has been stripping the lining with each brushing, and it's dead cells that I've been pulling from my mouth. Eww, right? It's not only inconvenient and weird, but my whole mouth is burning. My tongue is numb. The walls of my mouth feel raw. The other thing I've been reading is that this toothpaste actually stains your teeth (stannous fluoride being the culprit). I'm not willing to test that one out, though!"
5.00,"I loved this toothpaste. It really makes your teeth feel cleaner longer."
5.00,"I tried the crest plaque control and it really seemed to help. I brush my teeth at least 2-3 times per day and floss and this product really seemed to do the job. I would recommend it."
1.00,"I used this product as recommended on the bottle's label & had very bad results. It left a really bad metallic taste in my mouth that lasted all day. I felt like my breath must have been bad as the lingering all day taste was awful. I went to eat a handful of salted cashews & they had absolutely ZERO flavor. I could not taste the salt or cashews at all. This carried over to other salted foods & citrus drinks as well. I went to the dentist the other day & had my teeth cleaned. I used this again as directed thinking that I just needed a couple of days to get used to a new product. The next day I found small brown spots on my newly cleaned teeth that will not brush away! I am not a coffee drinker or tobacco product user. I searched the internet & low & behold many many people have this problem. I would never ever recommend this to anyone. Now I understand why I have seen this deeply discounted at pharmacies & bargain stores."
5.00,"I'm not sure I would buy this every time I need toothpaste, but I would definitely switch this in once in a while. The taste is decent and it, with the brush, cleans well."
4.00,"I do like this rinse however I feel its overpriced but works great."
5.00,"i'm nicely surprised by how fresh my mouth feels afte using this paste and how long the freshness lasted."
4.00,"I always use Crest toothpaste, but this one is my favorite! It makes my teeth so fresh and so clean!"
5.00,"The Crest Pro-Heath mouth wash helpped be keep that ultra clean feeling I get after a dentist visit. I will continue to recommend this product to my friends and family!"
5.00,"I recently tried the Crest pro-health toothpaste and absolutely loved it. The toothpaste made my mouth feel cleaner for a longer period of time. It was a nice fresh minty taste and I will definately continue to use this product!"
5.00,"When I chose the CREST PRO-HEALTH FOR LIFE TOOTHPASTE, I didn't realize that this was marketed and intended for people over 50. I'm not over 50, but I figure that it's never too early to start helping my teeth. Anyway, I've been using the CREST PRO-HEALTH FOR LIFE for the past 2-3 months, daily (morning and night), and my teeth do look slightly whiter. Occasionally, I get some sensitivity in two spots when brushing (I use Philips Sonicare HX6972/10 FlexCare Plus Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush), but it isn't constant and tends to come and go and only happens when I brush, so I'm not sure if using the PRO-HEALTH actually made it stop, but the sensitivity isn't there when I brush now. Like some others have noted the toothpaste does have a gritty texture, but I don't mind that at all because I figure that helps polish my teeth better. And it tastes like Aim \"fight the cavity creeps\" Toothpaste that some of you might remember from the 70s, which has a minty-wintergreen flavor. Only time will tell if continued use of CREST PRO-HEALTH FOR LIFE will keep our teeth in their best condition as we age, but I figure it can't hurt."
5.00,"This mouthwash leaves your breath feeling fresh for a very long time. I really did like it and it didn't burn like others."
4.00,"This has become my daughter's favorite toothpaste!"
4.00,"A lot easier on my gums and does a good job with keeping my teeth clean. Not expensive either. I'd buy it again."
4.00,"I've always been pleased with Crest products and once again they did not disappoint. Toothpaste had pleasing taste and worked really well. It will be purchased again."
5.00,"I havent' used Crest in over 20 years, It gives the \"Just back from the dentist clean.\" And my teeth stay clean all day,nice fresh breath, too. Love it!"
4.00,"Great cleaning, and feels great! My teeth felt clean and looked whiter."
5.00,"Every time I use Crest ProHealth Clinical Plaque Control toothpaste is like the moment the dental hygienist finishes cleaning my teeth at the dentist's office. I love it!"
4.00,"My dentist says that its not the toothpaste but the act of brushing that cleans teeth. But the ingredients can have a beneficial effect. This toothpaste tries to cover everything that can go wrong. Good for Crest. This is the thickest toothpaste I have ever used. I think it has been helpful for my gums although I regularly brush my gums vertically to toughen them so they don't bleed from my flossing. It is harder to use up the last of the toothpaste because the nozzle is fairly hard to compress."
4.00,"Although priced a little higher than the other Crest products I would definitely buy it. It does a great job of cleaning my teeth and leaving a fresh taste in my mouth."
5.00,"My husband and I loved this toothpaste. Left our teeth feeling incredibly clean and polished; will definately purchase again!"
5.00,"This toothpaste truly makes my teeth feel clean. Most toothpastes i feel as if I need to scrub my teeth like my toothbrush is an sos pad of some sort."
5.00,"I love the Crest Pro-Health Clinical Plaque Control toothpaste. It really leaves my teeth feeling better than others I have used. I will continue to use it! Thank you so much."
1.00,"I have always had white teeth with a natural yellow tinge.  I have been brushing with this toothpaste for 6 months and didn't have a problem until now.  All of a sudden I have noticed that I have green-brown staining on the tongue side of my lower teeth! WTF!!  I brush regularly and floss, so it isn't plaque (also, I just had a teeth cleaning).  I looked it up and the active ingredient in the toothpaste is stannous flouride-- which causes tooth discoloration!!                                                                     Discontinue Use Immediately!!"
5.00,"my teeth felt clean, and my breath smelled fresh. i love this stuff."
5.00,"Didn't make me feel like I had to rinse my mouth out, left my mouth with a clean, refreshing feel. It's nice to start the day with fresh breath!"
5.00,"My teeth felt clean all day. I even had fresh breath all day. My dentist will thank me for that! I would recommend this to anyone, even people with soft teeth, it was gentle yet thorough."
5.00,"I love Pro Health toothpaste, as close to the dentist cleaning as I have come."
4.00,"For the cost, I would not say that it is better than other brands of Mouth wash."
4.00,"it reall made my teeth feel clean and that fresh feeling seemed to last longer than with other toothpastes."
5.00,"Does a great job freshens your breath without burning so everyone can use and reap the benefits. Most definitely recommend."
4.00,"I can't speak to this mouthwash's long-term dental benefits...that takes months to determine, and even then, who knows? I use mouthwash/rinse for basically one reason, to enliven the mouth after the grunge of the day or morning. I'm sure it helps the gums as well, but it's no substitute for flossing, I'm sure. I drink a lot of black coffee, so while it doesn't give me coffee breath like with milk, I'm sure it's still noticeable, and I don't want it to be! So I use rinses for that reason. I used this one and immediately noticed an improvement. It works quickly, and it never develops that stinging burning that Listerine is known for. I felt refreshed and cleaner, and didn't have that coffee aftertaste, which I assume indicates coffee breath. I like it, at least for this specifc use."
1.00,"i have been using Listerine for a long time and the only problem i have with it is the burning feeling i have to endure while rinsing. And so i jumped with joy when i saw this product. However the result was terrible. As advertise, there was no burning sensation while rising. But couple hours after using it, my taste bud got swollen, my tongue felt like a very bad burn on hot coffee, my salivary gland was swollen as well. By the end of the day, i noticed sore spots on the gum of my lower teeth. This product left a terrible feeling in my mouth that last for several days even though i stopped using it after the first day. It's so horrible that it's painful to talk                                              Now i go back to Listerine. I have to endure the 30s burning but after that i'm sure that there would be no painful effects. I have used Crest toothpaste for a very long time as well and nothing like this ever happen"
5.00,"This product is great. It makes my teeth feel very clean. I would definitely purchased it again and I would recommend it to others."
5.00,"I've always been a Crest user and so I looked forward to trying their pro-health toothpaste. I thought it was great. It's supposed to control plaque so I'll have to wait on a dentist visit to see what he says but for me it seems like a great product. The taste and texture was similar to me like most of their toothpastes, which I enjoy."
1.00,"My Dentist gave me a sample of Crest Pro-something can't really call it health. I read the ingredients and even the statement on the box says that stannous fluoride stains your teeth. After reading the reviews I'm definately avoiding the mouth slime and teeth staining. If you have to go to the dentist to get it off of your teeth per the other reviews it isn't worth it. I'm not waiting until I get sloughing of the mouth just like Chemotherapy that also cause slouthing of the mouth. I wonder if I can throw it in the trash or is it considered hazardous waste."
4.00,"I did like the taste, that it leaves on the mouth and that it feels clean. Would purchase the product again."
5.00,"Clean teeth fresh breath,loved it.I would recommend it to anyone who wants the same results. It attacks plaque."
5.00,"I have used several mouth washes/rinses over the years, but fell in love with this Crest product. My teeth and gums feel stronger, my enamel whiter and that plaque sticky feeling didn't reappear for several hours!"
5.00,"Well, I have to be honest. I loved the results after using the toothpaste. I like the way that it made my teeth smooth and clean feeling. I didn't notice any grit or anything left on my teeth after using it. I did not, however, enjoy the taste of it. It was a little too \"spicy\" for my liking. My kids wouldn't use it if I paid them. They don't like strong tasting toothpaste. My husband loved it, so I gave it to him to use. I like the quality and the price wasn't bad, but I don't think it is something I will buy for myself in the future."
1.00,"I was looking for something strong to stop my gum bleeding. But this thing burns my tongue after each use. After 3 use I lost taste in my tongue."
5.00,"Love this product, gets teeth squeaky clean! I would definitley recommend it."
5.00,"Gingivitis seems to run in my family as far as oral health goes. I like that this product fights both gingivitis and plaque and strengthens your teeth. It keeps your mouth feeling cleaner longer. Pair that with the plaque control toothpaste and you have a winning combination! Thanks Crest!"
4.00,"Made my teeth feel cleaner. Taste is not the best. But I would buy the product."
4.00,"This leaves my teeth & mouth feeling so fresh and clean! I love it!"
4.00,"I loved the new Crest Clinical Mouthwash. It does not leave my mouth feeling like it has been burned from alcohol yet it leaves it feeling clean and fresh."
3.00,"I thought the mouthwash tasted really gross and felt like it left a film on my mouth. I didn't like it... my teeth felt a little bit clean, but the taste left on my tongue was really gross. Thanks for the opportunity to try it, maybe other people will like it; it was just not for me."
5.00,"Our entire family loves this product. We all tried and now we have a new toothpaste! It keeps your teeth clean and your breath fresh. It is wonderful!"
3.00,"Crest Pro-Health is a mouthrinse that has no alcohol (less burning, less drying of mouth), which is rare in a mouthwash, as most mouthwashes are at least 50% or more alcohol (alcohol is a good disinfectant). To replace the antibacterial effect of the alcohol, Crest has added the agent CPC (cetylpyridinium chloride). This is a positively charged molecule that is drawn to the negatively charged bacteria in one's mouth. CPC causes death of the bacteria through destroying the cell's membrane. Thus, it does indeed kill bacteria and bacteria is what causes bad breath, gingivitis, and cavities.The addition of CPC does not come without drawbacks however. There are two main side effects that may cause consumers to avoid this product. First and foremost, when CPC kills bacteria, and the bacteria are not removed from the teeth, they eventually stain brown. Thus, if the consumer is not extremely diligent in removing plaque by brushing thoroughly and flossing at least once per day, there is the almost certain result of brown staining. The stain will appear between the teeth, as this is where bacteria primarily reside. The stain is not permanent, and can be removed, but it can be unsightly. (Be aware that the presence of brown stain means the product is working). To avoid staining, one must thoroughly brush one's teeth and floss BEFORE rinsing for one minute with Crest Pro-Health. Since the recommendation is to rinse twice a day (as CPC lasts 12 hours), the thorough cleaning must be done each time. Be aware that Staining is furthered by the drinking of coffee and dark colas.The second side-effect is a possible taste alteration associated with CPC. Food may have a slightly metalic taste. This is not reported by all users.From a dentist's perspective, this is a good product, but it is not for everyone. Since most people do not thoroughly brush and floss their teeth twice a day, most people will experience the brown staining and cease to use this product (thus all the negative product reviews). If you are willing to do the work of a thorough cleaning twice a day, then this product will further improve your oral health by killing bacteria.The final drawback (not usually mentioned) is the price. This bottle holds 500 ml of rinse. If one uses 10 ml per use and uses 20 ml per day, this product will not last a month. So one may go through two bottles a month.This product requires much of the user in terms of oral hygiene and pocket-book cost. It is a good, safe, and effective product, however, one must carefully consider if the required motivation is present before purchasing the rinse. It is not for everyone.This manufacturer is offering Crest Pro Health Rinse at perhaps the best price among the suppliers.Dr. Jim Koenig, DDS"
3.00,"I loved the taste of this mouthwash but didn't like the bubbly and foaming reaction. I had to wash my mouth out several times to get rid of the foaming. Besides that, my mouth and teeth were clean and refreshed. I wouldn't buy it again but I think it did get the job done."
5.00,"I am loving the rinse! I've been using it everyday after brushing, and my mouth still feels fresh hours after using it. My teeth feel so clean, as though the plaque is too scared to even try to build up! :-)"
5.00,"I must admit, I fell for the ads on TV about how it's the best new toothpaste out there. So I bought a tube, and tried it.                                                                     First of all, the only flavor is cinammon. But it's a refreshing change. I have had no staining, no red streaks or whatever the other reviewer stated, and it does not foam uncontrollably. That might depend on the kind of toothbrush you use as well. I also use this with Listerine.                                                                     I gave this product 5 stars because it tastes good, it doesn't cost a whole lot, it's ADA-approved (a MUST in my book), and because it works. Happy customer and I would recommend it to others!"
5.00,"I have been a fan of Crest Pro-Health toothpastes for a while. It's the only kind of adult toothpaste my kids will use, because the flavor is mild, but it still delivers a clean, fresh end result!"
4.00,"I tried this rinse and loved it. My mouth felt fresh and clean. It wasn't too intense where it burns your mouth. After a couple of days, I loved the clean mouth feel. I will continue to use Crest Pro-Health Clinical Rinse."
4.00,"I agree the flavor isn't that great but it does leave my mouth feeling nice and clean.."
4.00,"I liked the way the mouth wash made my teeth and mouth feel fresh"
4.00,"Works great...leaves teeth feeling really clean and fresh."
5.00,"i really liked it a lot it was very refeshing and it left ur mouth feeling clean!!"
5.00,"What a great mouthwash! My mouth felt clean for hours-what a nice feeling. Price is the only downfall but I do think I will spend the extra money to for a terrific mouthwash."
5.00,"First of all, my sympathies for those who have experienced problems with this product. I've been using this mouthwash for several months, and my experience has been positive. No staining, no taste problems, etc. The dentist sure noticed my improvement. My best recommendation is to try the product and see. If it creates a problem for you, stop immediately. Also - and most importantly: DON'T use it twice a day as Crest (and the bottle itself)recommends. Once a day is fine. Perhaps twice a day is the source of some people's problem with this product? It is strong, but not as bad - or awful - as Listerine. I will update my review if I start to experience any negative results."
1.00,"This product is so bad it caused me to write my first amazon review ever. After two uses, as others experienced, my tongue feels burnt and there is a odd metallic strange taste in my mouth still 24 hours later. Steer clear."
5.00,"A perfect match for toothbrush.We loved the refreshing taste."
5.00,"Amazing! I loved this product - I will put this on my permanent shopping list!"
5.00,"This is the best mouthwash that I've ever used. It makes my mouth tingle."
1.00,"I have used this product for about 2 days, and these are my experiences with it. This toothpaste is not as thick as others. I find its so runny, that it is difficult to keep it on the brush during the time it takes to close the tube and stick it in your mouth. Most of the toothpaste runs out of my mouth before I am done brushing. I use a bulky electric toothbrush, so closing my mouth makes it very difficult to brush at the proper angles. Its so this it also sprays and splatters all over the place. I've never had a problem with other pastes, at least not to this extent. After brushing my teeth my mouth feels slimy and slightly raw around the gum lines. My gums appeared bright red, though I do not brush that hard. My cheeks and tongue seemed to be coated with a grayish film. I was able to scratch it off fingernail and it began to peel like a slime. I have no doubt this was the top layers of skin, which were perfectly healthy prior to brushing. I have also started to develop chapped lips, especially at the corners of my mouth. I live in Texas, it is summer, and the humidity is ridiculous. I should not have chapped lips. I can only attribute this to the toothpaste. I only bought this because my dentist recommended it, but I have been back on my traditional toothpaste, Aquafresh Extreme Clean Foaming Action, for a day and a half now, and my mouth has improved significantly already. I contacted Crest and told them the problems, and they agreed to refund my money. Its the principal of the matter, not as if 4 bucks is that big a deal to me. I also intend do confront my dentist on the matter in 6 months when I go back."
5.00,"Loved this product! It was better than I was expecting! Made my teeth feel super clean!"
4.00,"I think its a good product and will keep using crest because I like what it does for my teeth."
5.00,"Very refreshing and love the whitening. Floss doesn't break when using."
5.00,"I personally use each of these items regularly for my dental needs but I buy them all separatly. What these kits are especially nice for is as a gift to my family members in both the military and those attending college. At first I though sending these would be met with all the enthusism of a visit to the DMV, but sometimes a gift is more about what someone need rather than what they want.. I was surprised by the \"Thank yous\" I've received from sending these. All in all a great collection of essential dental necessities all in one place."
5.00,"I truly enjoyed the toothpaste. My teeth felt clean and the feeling lasted all day."
1.00,"This mouth wash has a terrible taste, and is much worse than the cheaper alcohol based mouth washes. Even worse, after using the product for 3 days I have lost most of my ability to taste and my tongue feels like it has been chemically burned. The pain on my tongue actually woke me up in the middle of the night, it felt like I went to sleep with acid in my mouth. There is also a lingering foam that stays in your mouth after you use it. I try spiting it out but it continues to foam. This is a terrible product and I have no idea how it managed to get FDA approval. If you read online there are many sites and news stories about how this product is hurting people, Crest needs to stop selling these."
4.00,"I bought this toothpaste for the family because I normally only use sensitive type products. I did try it a few times so I could compare before I bought it again. It leaves a fresh clean feeling not to strong taste. I will buy it again ."
5.00,"I really enjoy using the Crest Pro-Health mouthwash. It really makes my teeth and gums feel better. I like it better than leading brands because it does not have a horrible after-taste. Thanks for letting me try this product."
2.00,"I seem to be one of the few who hasn't suffered major irritation from this toothpaste, but I still don't like it. It is supposed to be \"mint\" but just tastes like baking soda (which I hate), even though baking soda is advertised nowhere on it. This seems to be a jack-of-all-toothpastes, so I guess I shouldn't be surprised. But it also has something gritty in it (perhaps to be used as an abrasive?), which I also hate. So basically, this stuff makes me hate brushing my teeth more than ever. For my own hygiene, I will toss this stuff. And based on all the other complaints about irritation, don't take the risk: buy something else."
5.00,"I love it, because to promote healthy teeth and gums and kill millions of germs that cause plaque, gingivitis and bad breath without alcohol"
5.00,"Pleasant taste leading to a clean mouth feeling after brushing. Feel that it will control the plaque very well. Thank you for the opportunity to try the toothpaste."
5.00,"i love the feeling of my mouth being clean, after i used the new crest"
5.00,"Over the years, Crest has been a name I felt I could trust and these products hold up to that standard. I am very pleased with this line of products and will continue to use them!"
5.00,"I so love the Crest Pro Health products! This toothpaste is great...even for my sensitive mouth."
5.00,"Love how clean this makes your teeth and whole mouth feel."
5.00,"I have used peroxide in the past and this is a much better alternative. It really cleans your mouth and you feel the clean for hours. I can’t even begin to tell you how clean and fresh my mouth feels. It is great! It is a little costly for a mouthwash but if your like me and don’t like the way most mouthwashes burn this one is for you. You get the great clean without the burn. The only thing I don’t like about it is the foamy feel you get like with peroxide but at least you know it is working and I am used it since I used to use peroxide. Like I said this is a much better alternative and leaves your mouth feeling clean for a long time."
5.00,"Very clean-feeling, did an awesome job! Would recommend to anyone"
5.00,"I got the gum protection type of toothpaste, and I absolutely love it. It has all the features I need (sensitivity, fighting gingivitis) and it tastes AWESOME. It's a great flavor, and I am very happy with the way it makes my mouth feel...which is super clean!"
5.00,"This mouthwash left my mouth feeling fresh and clean and the feeling lasted a long time. I recommend it highly."
5.00,"I love this tooth paste, I feel like I do when I leave the dentist. My teeth feel so clean!"
5.00,"My husband loves this product. It leaves his mouth feeling clean without the burn of alcohol."
4.00,"It was from Crest, so we knew it would be great before we used it. It didn't let us down. I haven't used it long enough to see if it will continue to help with plaque, but initally it works great"
4.00,"I will only use Crest pro health mouth wash, I love that it doesn't contain alcohol which defeats the purpose of mouthwash"
5.00,"I love this toothpaste! It keeps your mouth fresh, last a while and my teeth feel extra clean longer!"
5.00,"Worked well between my teeth. Plus it had a minty taste."
4.00,"The plaque control toothpaste is great. It definitely has that just from the dentist clean feeling."
5.00,"One of our favorite tooth paste so far. It leaves our teeth a fresh clean feeling, and a clean nice breath after we brushed. Highly recommended."
4.00,"I love this toothpaste as it leaves a very good smell in my mouth and also makes my mouth feels clean! I use this in the morning to \"wake me up\" and it works great especially when I brush after my lunch and about to meet a client at work!"
5.00,"I get so many compliments on how white my teeth are, they ask what I do to get them so white, I say I brush them with a toothpaste that really works."
5.00,"I trust the crest brand name very much so I was pleased to try their clinical strength Crest.I did enjoy the way it made my teeth feel clean and my breath smell good."
4.00,"I love all of the Crest products, for myself and for my kids! Thank you!!"
3.00,"It has been years since I regularly used Crest products. The Crest Pro-Health Collection Kit comes with four items. Because each can be purchased separately, I will review them as individual units. 1. Crest Pro-Health Multi-Protection Rinse (Mouthwash) Mouthwash users tend to either love or hate the sting of alcohol-based rinses. Those who love feel that the sting is an indicator that the product is 'working' in their mouth, killing germs, etc. Those who hate it feel the burn is uncomfortable, causing further irritation when brushing teeth and gums. Those who hate the burn will LOVE this rinse. It is alcohol-free and does not have any sting whatsoever. My wife described the flavor as similar to licorice. I found it slightly sweet, but a far cry from the ACT kiddie mouth washes of days past. The bottle claims that this rinse protects for 24 hours after use and should be used twice per day. Little specks of blue come out when the rinse is spit out. They may be totally irrelevant, but I found my teeth looked brighter after using the rinse. I strongly recommend this mouthwash over generic brands. 5/5 stars. 2. Oral-B Glide Pro-Health Deep Clean Floss (Dental floss) This is the best dental floss I have ever used. The standard waxed varieties that can be found anywhere do not compare. This gliding floss naturally fits between teeth and slides back and forth with NO irritation. My gums have a tendency to bleed. They did not bleed when using this floss. I would rate this product a perfect 5/5 for its design and usefulness to all. 5/5 stars. 3. Crest Pro-Health Toothpaste (Cool Peppermint flavor) This toothpaste is not overly minty, sweet, or thick. It applied well to teeth, gums, and the tongue without issue. Some toothpastes don't seem to last as long with a good brushing (5+ minutes). A small amount of this toothpaste does the job without having to reapply more to the toothbrush. While this is not the best toothpaste I have every used (that would be Mentadent) it is rightly placed in the upper echelon of commercially available pastes and gels. 4/5 stars. 4. Oral-B Pro-Health All-in-One Toothbrush (Medium, with CrossAction bristles) The Oral-B reviewed was medium, where generally I use soft-bristled brushes. The contrast was rough the first time around, but have a tendency to soften with time. Because I only used this brush once, I cannot vouch for whether this will happen or how long it will take. I will say the brush looks very well-made, with bristles in various levels and angles for maximum cleanliness of the molars, gums, and incisors. The back of the brush has a tongue scrub, which I have always appreciated (and should be standardized by now). The handle is thick, grips well, and is easy to hold and brush with. 4/5 stars. The Crest Pro-Health Collection Kit is an all-in-one bundle of quality products. Unfortunately, at $71 is makes much more sense to by the products individually in stores or online. Because of this, I cannot recommend the bundle for families at this price point. Overall: 3/5 stars"
5.00,"I suffer from gingivitis, so I really appreciate this product. The taste was a winner, so it's become my daily rinse."
3.00,"I'm pretty sure it's not slime that the toothpaste is leaving in your mouth, but the dead skin cells from the inner lining of your cheeks. Yes, I have experienced this almost every morning and I've been using this toothpaste for several months now. I'd be hard pressed to find a toothpaste that leaves my mouth feeling cleaner, but I can't stand having to take a tissue and wiping the inside of my mouth everyday. Time to find something new. But once again - it's not toothpaste slime, it's your mouth slime!"
5.00,"I give it 5 stars!! Will def buy again!"
4.00,"After using the plaque control, my teeth felt cleaner and fresh leaving them smooth and ready for the day!"
5.00,"my family loves Crest. they are an amazing company. I would recommend their products to everyone."
5.00,"I have been an exclusive Crest user for many years. I think it leaves my teeth feeling cleaner than any other toothpaste."
4.00,"I just had some fillings done, so I am anxiously waiting to use this mouthwash! It smells so nice though! Just the right amount of freshness:)"
5.00,"I noticed a difference in the cleanliness of my teeth and their brightness! I recommend this product."
1.00,"I am not sure what consumer panel Crest polled when they were developing this product, but they made this ... THING ... that should be completely appealing to those of you who enjoy hours and hours of painful burning sensations in their mouth, accompanied by a loss of taste for days after a single use. Side benefits from this product include: food takes on a wonderful metallic flavor, and if you use this product religiously, Crest has indicated (in the small print, of course) that you mighty be lucky enough to see your teeth turn a lovely shade of brown. For a mouthwash that Crests touts as their \"most advanced yet,\" this reviewer can only think that perhaps this was written ironically by the playful hipsters in Crest's marketing division. A sane consumer, however, would probably disagree. This product is not fabulous or advanced in any sense; far from it, it is an AWFUL step backward and an AWFUL mouthwash. Similar to other reviewers, I noticed two hideous ... benefits ... from using this product just a few times. First and foremost, this product brings the pain on like Rocky Marciano or perhaps a thousand burning habenero peppers. It produced a some serious and lingering burning sensation across the mouth and tongue that, like the Last Airbender, I simply could not wait for it to end. Another ... benefit.. was the a sustained loss of taste, perhaps nice for those of us on a diet, but pretty cruddy for anyone else. After just a couple of days, I noticed that my sense of taste went completely flat. No fine dining for the next few days until my tongue has had a chance to recover from Crest's chemical warfare attack. Even respected brands, like Crest, can produce bad products, and this has to be the worst mouthwash that Crest has ever produced. Caveat emptor!"
5.00,"Not much to say here it's well priced, prime eligible and tastes pleasant. This was exactly what I was looking for in a toothpaste."
3.00,"This rinse does the job as far as getting your mouth and teeth clean is concerned. However, the aftertaste does last for a very long time. I consider the aftertaste to last about 3x's long than other varieties I have tried. I attempted to rinse my mouth out with water about 6x's, but I still had the aftertaste."
5.00,"This is a great mouth rinse with a great taste. My mouth feel cleaner when used the rinse and Crest Pro-Health Clinical Toothpaste together. Great products."
5.00,"My FAVORITE toothpaste. This is the do-it-all toothpaste! Great taste, superb cleaning, and my dentist approves, what more can I say?"
5.00,"I tried this and really like the clean, fresh feeling it leaves in my mouth. My family loves it too!"
4.00,"I purchased the whitening. The paste has crunchy crystals similar to the cleaning gel at the dentist. It's too early to tell if the paste is whitening my teeth."
5.00,"This product is great for those with sensitive teeth. My husband has a hard time finding a great toothpaste that get his teeth looking great without hurting his teeth. This scored high on our families list with all of us."
5.00,"I love the way my teeth feel clean and my breath feel fresh"

5.00,"I have been using this product everyday after brushing my teeth and my mouth feels fresher and cleaner. I am glad that crest made such good product."
5.00,"I love the way my mouth feels fresh when using this mouthwash. I love the fact that it helps keep teeth white while freshening your breath and fighting gingivitis!"

5.00,"Great product. Kept my breath fresh all day long.. Will continue to use this product and recommend to others."
5.00,"This product has improved my dental appointments. This is the only toothpaste I will continue to buy."
5.00,"My teeth have never felt as clean as they did when I used Crest. And my breath was fresher all day because so many germs were removed and it busted through the plaque on my teeth."

5.00,"This product is excellent for help keep plaque from coming back and has pleasent taste."
1.00,"I really wanted to like this product but I cannot get over how gross it tastes. The mild mint flavor of other Pro-Health products was what I looked forward to, but this is just disgusting. The foamy feeling is very unpleasant and the aftertaste makes me want to brush my teeth again. Yuck!"
5.00,"I really enjoyed using this mouthwash kept my mouth clean all day. The taste was appreciated too."
5.00,"I felt the toothpaste really cleaned well. It was a good value for the price and I will continue to purchase this product."

5.00,"I noticed a difference on my teeth within a week. Loved the product will keep on using it!"
5.00,"I enjoyed this toothpaste a lot - it tasted great, had a good texture and a little went a long way."
5.00,"No burn while using but you can tell its working by the frothy foam feeling. Makes your mouth feel clean and there is comfort in knowing its fighting against maintaining the overall health of your mouth and gums. The strong aftertaste of peroxide is prevelant but its just another sign you know its working."
4.00,"I have many dental problems. I am always looking for products that work well to fight gingivitis. This mouth wash does just that. I will definitely try it again!"
5.00,"Makes my mouth feel fresh and clean even after drinking a cup of coffee. I'll def. buy it again."
5.00,"This mouth wash made my breath feel fresh and clean."

5.00,"Crest products are the best. Very clean feeling and fresh breath"
4.00,"All of my family tried the Crest Pro Health toothpaste this past few weeks and here are the results. Myself, loved the clean feeling, hopeing for a new flavor. My husband, he doesn't care what he uses. My teenage girls, they didn't mind the flavor , and they thought it kept their breath fresher."
4.00,"I thought this product worked well. I like that you don't have to use alot to get the results you want."
5.00,"I love Crest Pro Health Clinical toothpaste. It does seem to work better than other toothpaste. My teeth feel extra clean and my mouth extra fresh! Thanks for letting me try it, I will definitely continue to use Crest Clinical toothpaste."
5.00,"I would highly recommend this product to everyone, it made my teeth feel clean and I felt protected my teeth a little more than other products out there."
5.00,"I loved trying the new Crest!! It is keeping my teeth clean and refreshed!!"

4.00,"Love the way this mouth rinse works! Have already noticed a difference!"
5.00,"My husband is very picky about his toothpaste. He LOVES this paste and always requests that I purchase this when he out."
5.00,"Loved this product. The foam made if feel as though it was working deep down to get rid of all the germs while the whitening worked in a matter of a week. No burning in the mouth causing my eyes to water was a nice change. I would highly recommend."
5.00,"I liked this crest toothpaste because it left my teeth feeling cleaner, and the taste was pleasant and fresh."
5.00,"We like Crest Pro Health toothpaste. It keeps your teeth feeling clean. My kids enjoy the flavor too so it makes brushing their teeth more enjoyable."

4.00,"Love this toothpaste--keeps my mouth feeling fresh for a long time and doesn't irritate my sensitive teeth. Thumbs up!"
4.00,"It had a pleasant taste and made my teeth feel nice and clean."
4.00,"I love going to the dentist because of how clean my mouth feels afterward. With this toothpaste, it's nearly the same feeling!"
5.00,"My whole family is using Crest now and we love it. thanks"
5.00,"Used it with my sonicare... Great job! My teeth were very clean"
1.00,"Makes the insides of my mouth peel off. Makes my taste buds numb for a while. Overall really bad toothpaste."
4.00,"I was impressed with how well it worked. No problems with taste our anything either. Overall really like this product!"
5.00,"I have always used Crest tooth paste but had never tried this one until now, it is my new favorite tooth paste! It leaves your teeth feeling very clean."
5.00,"I love how clean the toothpaste makes my mouth/teeth feel, and the added protection is definitely desired! My teeth enamel has worn off a bit and my teeth are sensitive, so the Crest products help in that regard. I wish the product were not so expensive though."
4.00,"It left my teeth and breathe feeling fresh and clean!"
4.00,"It makes my breath feel fresth without the burn. Have not used it long enogh yet to get full benefits of whiter teeth and enamel renew. good value for the money"
4.00,"This toothpaste promises to defend against a multiple of dental woes, from cavities and gingivitis, to weak enamel and bleeding gums. It is directed to people fifty and over but I think it is appropriate for any one with sensitivity or tooth and gum issues. More of a translucent gel than a paste. it is a light green with little abrasive beads. The flavor is a mild spearmint, not my favorite but not awful either. It left my teeth feeling clean. As I have only used this product for about ten kdays, I can not speak to the long term results. I have not noticed a difference in whiteness but I have not suffered from he bleeding gums which plague me occasionally. Bottom line, this is a decent product. If you suffer from sensitive teeth and sore gums or find tooth products with more aggressive flavoring objectionable, you might want to give this toothpaste a try."
3.00,"does the job leaves your teeth and mouth fresh and clean"
4.00,"I tried this on my dentist's recommendation and really like it. The no alcohol formula is fresh and pleasant without the burning."
4.00,"This product left my teeth feeling clean and the price wasn't bad."
1.00,"I just purchased this product and used it for the first time last night. I have been using a natural toothpaste (Spry) for about a year now and just happened to run out. I bought this because it sounded like a pretty good toothpaste (from the description on the box). As soon as I used it last night, my gums immediately started hurting... it felt like they were burning and swollen. My jaw also started hurting right away and the pain lasted for awhile after using the toothpaste. I thought maybe it was just an initial reaction to some chemical because I have been using natural toothpaste for so long. So, I tried it again this morning and right away got the same burning and pain!!! I am really shocked that a toothpaste would do that! I have used crest plenty of times in the past and never had a problem. This Clinical Pro-Health must be some nasty stuff to cause a reaction like this! I am throwing it away (which is a horrible waste of $5.00). And for the other reviewers who do not believe the negative reviews... I am a stay at home mother and do not work for any toothpaste company. I had not seen the reviews until just now when I was searching for why this toothpaste would cause all the burning and pain... I would not risk your money (or mouth) by buying this."
4.00,"I really like this Crest Pro-Health Clinical toothpaste; it's become one of my preferred brands. It's pretty pricey, but that's where couponing comes in handy!! It has a mild but minty taste, and it foams nicely. My teeth always feel clean and my breath fresh after using this toothpaste."
4.00,"I like the taste of this mouthwash. I feel cleaner teeth."
5.00,"I've tried several mouthwashes over the years and have never been overly fond of any of them. This one I greatly appreciate, though. Be sure to follow the instructions on the label and RINSE any toothpaste from your mouth before using it (is that why people are having problems?). Also, yes, it leaves a foamy white residue on your tongue, but that's because it foams slightly when using it due to a tiny bit of hydrogen peroxide in the mix -- I think this is what characterizes it from other similar products. That's easily remedied by a quick rinse with water once again, too. So it's a bit more \"work\" (if you can call it that?) than something like Listerine (which, by the way, DEFINITELY produces a burning sensation due to the alcohol -- I've never felt anything akin to that using this), but it's also the only mouthwash that has continued to make my mouth feel clean until after I wake up the next day. (I use it daily, and have for a while now, and have never experienced loss of taste or burning or metallic flavor or anything else that people are complaining about.) So, I repeat: rinse your mouth with water after brushing your teeth, and then again once you've used this, and you'll be fine. It really is the best."
4.00,"I thought that the taste of the Crest Pro Health toothpaste was really good. It is not really strong or too minty."
5.00,"this is a really good tooth paste, plesant flavor, long lasting freshness, and a really smooth feeling left on my teeth."
5.00,"I use the Pro Health line of products and this toothpaste is high quality also. Leaves my mouth tingly and clean tasting."
1.00,"My husband and I have been using this toothpaste for a couple of weeks and it does seem to clean and freshen, but then there is the MOUTH SLIME... After we brush, stings of slime form on our checks... like mouth boogers. Really gross..."
1.00,"This BURNS the inside of my cheeks so badly I have to actually cup my face with my hands to alleviate the pain. It does make you spit nasty slimy stuff, like snot. Feels like you can never spit it all out. I've used it several times over the course of a year because my boyfriend uses it often and I thought I was just hyper sensitive but I'm glad to see I'm definitely not the only one. The pain is indescribable."
3.00,"Good toothpaste. It made my mouth feel fresh longer. Though it was too pricey for a toothpaste."
4.00,"I always preferred Crest products, but Pro-Health is one of the best yet. It has a great taste and seems to reduce plaque build up longer. I would definietly buy it again."
5.00,"My trip to the dentist was much better after I switched to this paste. My cleaning was much faster the last time."
4.00,"When I review a product I cant tell you right a way if it works I have to use it until it's gone, so I have to say I love this product, it gets a thumbs up for total oral care not just clean teeth and freshness they are brighter and my gums are tighter this is a winner and a keeper in my household."
4.00,"it made my mouth feel fresh for longer. love the smell will definitely buy it again"
5.00,"I have to be honest I have tried many mouthwashes over the years but none delivers like this one. I am a coffee drinker, I just love my coffee but it stains my teeth and I cannot afford to pay for professional whitening all the time so with Crest Clinical I get the results I want. I use it everyday twice a day and my teeth look beautiful. In just two days of use you start seeing the difference and it leavesyou with a fresh clean feeling in your mouth. I also think it is important to brush your teeth with Crest Clinical or Vivid the results are amazing. I would definitely recommend this product to friends and family and will continue to use it."
4.00,"Loved the product, but would have a hard time paying full price for it."
5.00,"I enjoyed this toothpaste. It left my teeth feeling clean and fresh and just from the dentist feeling. I like the flavor."
5.00,"I love how Crest toothpaste makes my teeth look and feel."
4.00,"Product worked well. Does what it says it will do."
3.00,"My teeth felt wonderfully clean after using this product, but im not fond of the pure peroxide taste"
5.00,"It is a nice change of pace from having a strong alcohol mouthwash to this. It was gentle on you and worked great. It kept your mouth feeling fresh for a good length of time."
4.00,"this toothpaste makes ur mouth feel real clean. but once u eat there goes the cleanliness feeling. but as long as u dont eat ur mouth will feel clean for a while. thanks crest"
5.00,"This is actually very good tooth paste. Both my wife and I really love this new product by Crest. As strange as it may sound, I could actually tell a difference in the way my gums felt after about one week. On occasion, my gums would bleed a little when I brushed or flossed, but since I have been using this tooth paste that has not happened at all, not even once. Since the only thing that I have changed is my toothpaste, I have to deduct that this product does exactly what it claims to do. I only like the way this toothpaste doesn't foam up as much as others. There is actually nothing about this product that I don't like. Oh, it also has a very convenient flip top that doubles as a stand, so you can stand the tube up on the end, another plus. I highly recommend this product! 5 Stars!"
5.00,"I was totally amazed at the high quality of the toothpaste! My teeth were so clean and stayed feeling clean after lunch even though I was unable to brush after eating!"
5.00,"I really like the taste of this toothpaste and it always leaves a nice clean-feeling behind after I brush. I feel like my teeth were really clean and will definitely purchase again."
5.00,"Works well has a great brand and the packaging is great."
5.00,"I thought this toothpaste gave me fresh breath and super clean teeth."
4.00,"I love Crest Clinical rinse that alcohol free. Made my teeth feel very clean."
5.00,"It's the only thing my husband will use. We love it."
4.00,"After using this mouth rinse, my teeth feel almost as clean as after the dentist. I don't really like the taste. (which is why it got 4 stars instead of 5)"
4.00,"I'm sure it does my teeth good, but I don't like the purple goo that comes out when I spit it out. It also gets stuck in my teeth."
2.00,"I wish when products would say mint, they would tell you what kind it is. I have no great love of spearmint and that's what this rinse is. The cap can serve as a cap to `drink' the mouthwash out of. The taste is very strong and lasts for a while. The bottle says to use twice a day. There is no way I would want to use this before dinner, I would not be able to taste it or before I go to bed it would be way over powering to sleep with. The price seems a bit much for mouthwash that does the same as my other ones, except on a stronger more distasteful level."
4.00,"the rinse tasted refreshing and minty, mouth felt very clean after, even helped prevent plaque build up before next brushing. bottle lasted quite a while."
4.00,"I would recommend this toothpaste. My teeth felt very clean."
4.00,"I am waiting for dentures but the mouthwash was refreshing"
5.00,"I love it when I brush my teeth, and I can feel the clean - that is what the Crest Pro-Health Plaq Control tooth paste does. Loved it, and it wasn't too \"spicy\" as my kids say."
3.00,"I think there is too much peroxide in this product. It is very foamy and I didn't like the flavor."
5.00,"I liked it very very much! The benefits are awesome and it doesnt leave any scummy mouth feeling later - just nice and CLEAN! However I use a whitening toothpaste ALWAYS - I drink tea daily and couldnt do without that - but this is a really great product of you dont need whitening."
5.00,"I liked this toothpaste, it has a great flavor, makes your teeth feel dental hygienist fresh. I also love the large flip open cap."
1.00,"I bought this at Walgreens, not Amazon. It was on sale and included a rebate coupon, so it ended up costing about $.50. Sounds like a good deal?Not really. I used it twice (last night and this morning), and now I cannot taste anything. I have a strange metallic taste in my mouth and my tongue feels \"furry.\"Bad stuff."
5.00,"I was pleasantly surprised with this mouthwash. It doesn't have an over-powering flavor. Also, it didn't \"burn\" my mouth."
4.00,"I've always been a Crest user and continue to use it in my adulthood. They just seem to keep coming out with better products. I do like this new toothpaste. It always leaves my mouth feeling fresh and my teeth smooth. No cavaties from the dentist, so something is working!"
4.00,"After using this product my teeth were really smooth and a clean taste was left in my mouth."
4.00,"Just started using this toothpate and already I can tell a difference. Thank You"
5.00,"I started using this product almost as soon as it came out.  During the year before I started using it I had very sensitive teeth, especially around the deep pockets caused by gingivitis.  I really dreaded going to the dentist for a cleaning, it was that bad.  I could only stand luke warm water. I could not eat juicy fruits like grapes or oranges. I also had some bleeding from my gums.  After I started using Crest Pro Health, everything started to improve.  My teeth are now only a little sensitive (mostly to very cold water) and my gingivitis and deep pockets have improved.  The dentist has noticed in my visits.  No more bleeding.                                                                     I advised my son to start using it since he had some gum problems after his braces came off.  He is very happy with it and the dentist said his gums were 100% better on his last cleaning visit."
5.00,"This product leaves your muth fresh and clean for hours!"
5.00,"Really enjoyed this toothpaste. There are many varieties to choose from and I have seen a noticeable difference in just a few weeks."
5.00,"I liked this mouthwash a lot. It tastes great and does not sting. It leaves my mouth feeling fresh all morning. I will definitely buy this again."
5.00,"This toothpaste made my teeth feel and look noticably cleaner and whiter."
4.00,"This mouthwash has a great flavor and doesn't cause as much burning sensation as other mouthwashes I've tried. My mouth felt fresh and clean after using it. My only complaint is that it's a little spendy for mouthwash."
5.00,"This made my teeth feel smooth, clean, and leave me with minty fresh breath!"
5.00,"This Crest toothpaste definitely leaves you with a clean mouth and fresh breath."
5.00,"I received my package about a week ago. Started using crest verse my own toothpaste. I must say that I do see a difference in my teeth. I do have problems with my gums and hope by using this crest product it will help. I would recommend this product to others. I will update this review after I have finished the products."
4.00,"This product is really good. I would recommend it to my friends. It has a good flavor and gives my teeth a clean feeling after brushing."
5.00,"We love the pro-health line! The mouth wash is the best because you can feel the clean on your teeth and in your breath without the alcohol after taste that other brands have."
5.00,"Made my teeth feel clean all through the dayy!! =)"
1.00,"If possible, I would rate this zero stars. I purchased this product in-store and had not reviewed online beforehand. After several weeks of use, I noticed that my teeth had stains. There were brown spots and then it was particularly bad around my bottom four front teeth, both in between the teeth and along the gum line. My teeth also felt gritty and dirty all the time, even right after brushing. I discontinued use and hoped that the damage would fade. It did not. Someone else actually noticed and very gently asked me about. That's when I panicked. After doing online research, I realized this would require a trip to the dentist. After a thorough cleaning, I am pleased to report my dental hygienist gave me my smile back! Thankfully the damage was not permanent. I cannot believe a dental product would turn your teeth brown. Please do not use this product."
5.00,"I am picky about how a toothpaste tastes and feels and I love this one! If it really prevents plaque like it says it does it's a total winner!"
2.00,"Carolyn"
5.00,"Great fresh taste and doesn't burn your mouth. I will definately buy this again."
3.00,"The product is what I expected.  however I was somewhat upset at the expiration date on the product.  All tube of toothpaste were use befor november of 2012.  With just the wife and i that is not possible.  The product shipped needs to be longer than the 2 to 3 months."
5.00,"I purchased a trial size pro health tooth paste. when i brought it home, I thought i would be the only one using it. My family liked pro health tooth paste so much that I had to go back to the store to get another one.Now when i shop I have to pick up two at a time. that is to make sure that i will always have so in the house"
4.00,"As with all Crest products, this one is a keeper and we will be buying more in the future. Worked great!"
4.00,"Good oral hygiene is very important to me and my family. This product really helps me as a mom know that my kids are taking good care of their teeth. We've tried off brands before, and they just don't do as good a job. I'd rather buy good toothpaste and pay less at the dentist!"
5.00,"I found these to work great and left my teeth and mouth feeling very clean and didn't dry after the use of these products."
5.00,"this product is excellent for oral health for it does some great results on oral hygiene also the price is excellent for two are in the pack."
4.00,"Good Product with a great value! It's now part of preferred products we buy for our household."
5.00,"I stock up on these everytime I come back from china. I highly recommend it. I will keep buying it."
5.00,"I have been using this type of crest for over a year now, I didn't see much of a difference between pro health whitening I use and plaque one! Overall I love the Crest pro health series!"
4.00,"I love Crest all a round. this product in particular is great, I love how it freshens my breath and helps whiten my teeth. The only thing I didn't like so much was the after taste of the product, its not very good. But other than that I am a Fan and will purchase the product again."
5.00,"I've always loved Crest products, so this new line was no exception. I'll continue to trust Crest as the product for my teeth & keeping them healthy!"
5.00,"I love this toothpaste.. Its so minty, makes my breath fresher for longer and my teeth feel clean after using it. I would recommend this to every one."
5.00,"My teeth feel so much cleaner for a longer period of time!"
5.00,"I only needed a pea-sized dab of toothpaste on my brush and got a most effective clean feeling. I want a healthy smile and healthy teeth and I get both with Crest."
4.00,"I would totally recommend this product! It let a fresh cleaning feeling all day long!"
5.00,"I couldn`t believe how fresh and clean my mouth felt after using the Crest Pro health rinse! Even my teeth felt smoother,like I had just left the dentist`s office! I would definately encourage people to try it, and it is my first choice now!"
4.00,"I was pleased with this mouth wash. It left my mouth feeling fresh and clean without burning my mouth. I have actually recommended this to my mom and sister."
3.00,"This product may work good but I probably will not use it enough to tell.After using the rinse you are left will a yucky foam on your teeth for awhile. The part I thought was worse was food did not taste right for hours after using it. I thought it was just me but my daughter had the same problem."
3.00,"The toothpaste meets expectations (cleansing, minty), but is not exceptional. For the price, it is only fair value."
5.00,"Not sure what everyone is fussing about, but lets face it, complainers write reviews, so basically you are not hearing from the hundreds of thousands of people who have no issues with this product. Great fluoride rinse, tastes fine, I can still taste everything. Way less powerful than your average alcohol based mouth rinse. Our whole family uses it, no brown teeth, no issue. So unless you try it, you actually won't know what it is like. Pick up a bottle at your local store before you buy the case!"
5.00,"This toothpaste is the only one that leaves my mouth feeling squeaky clean!"
4.00,"this product worked great, left my teeth feeling clean."
4.00,"This product has wonderful advantages for healthy teeth. Myself and my spuse hae very sensitive teeth and this toothpaste did not affect them negatively. After brushing your mouth feels very clean and minty. The freshness also lasts for a long time. Will purchase this product again."
5.00,"Crest Pro-Health Clinical Gum Protection Collection of toothpaste and floss helped me reverse gingivitis in 2 weeks! I have no dental insurance, so I started using these products about 2 years ago. I was lucky enough to get to go to a dentist through a grant & My denist loves the effect is has had on my teeth."
4.00,"This product is great for all-around mouth help. It is a great way to feel confident in your toothpaste!"
5.00,"This is one of my favorite toothpastes. I LOVE how well it cleanses my teeth and makes my mouth feel super fresh!"
5.00,"Really liked how this product made my teeth look and feel."
4.00,"I tried it and at first I wasn't sure I'd stick with the toothpaste, I'm not crazy about the taste - but I do like that my teeth feel cleaner, even first thing in the morning and that's impressive - so, I'll see how things go at the next dental cleaning and if there is less plaque, then I will absolutely stay with it."
5.00,"Love the taste Love that it is alcohol free Have been using for a couple of years No staining or adverse effects at all and I have 4 veneers-can,t imagine what other are talking about Love this product and endorse 100%"
5.00,"This gives your teeth that smooth feeling you get after going for a professional cleaning. I love how clean my mouth felt! I will be switching to this."
5.00,"I've switched to this one. It's a winner in my book"
4.00,"Normally, I use , so this review will be largely a comparison of the two. I'm not in a position to verify all of the claims of either brand regarding effectiveness. To do so would require large-scale tests. So I'll write just as a user.TASTE: Unlike the other mouthwashes I've tried, the Crest mouthwash tastes more like toothpaste and less like pure mint. The taste, however, is not as strong with the Crest as with others, notably ACT. There have been times when, while swishing the mouthwash around for 30 seconds, the taste has become somewhat harsh. With the Crest, that happened less frequently.CONSISTENCY: I was in for a surprise the first time I used this. It foams in the mouth. The mouthwash is clear in the bottle, but once you start swishing it around, it foams a little. You won't end up looking like a rabid dog, but you will notice that the once-clear mouthwash has turned white.FEELING AFTERWARD: With the Crest, my teeth feel cleaner, though not as much so as they did with ACT. Still, there is a feeling of freshness that is pleasant.THE BOTTLE: Parents might want to know that the cap is not child-proof. It simply twists on and off. Moreover, the cap is not the easiest to measure with. It should be filled about a quarter of an inch, but the cap itself is well over one inch. In other words, at least in the bottle I received, the measuring line is not clear. With a little experience, however, I found that I could get the right amount. Children, however, might have trouble, but simply using a spoon or a separate measuring source should work fine.Overall, I like this product, and I hope that it's doing all it claims. I wish I could know for sure."
5.00,"I have always enjoyed the Crest Pro-Health line of toothpaste and after recently visiting my dentist for my cleaning, I am very confident that this new product will extend the benefits of my dental cleaning."
5.00,"This double pack when added together is sized and priced similar to a large single so that's good. The product itself is great probably one of the best in terms of performance."
4.00,"Crest toothpaste in my opinion is one of the best toothpastes for oral hygiene that is currently on the market. I have used rest all my life and pretty much intend to continue using it. I only have one complaint and mass that they have brought out a mass variety that does various things to keep your oral hygiene in Optimum health. I prefer, just the plain crest toothpaste without any whitening or mouthwash bill into it, I like to know my mouth is clean and healthy and I shall go to the dentist for any whitening.This is just my opinion and I know there are other people out there loving the idea of having many choices. If I choose a different brand it is because the price has increased on crest and the other \"Colgate\" is on sale at a price that is less expensive.I hope this recommendation is helpful to you!"
3.00,"Feel like its just ok. Don't feel like it scrapes as well as it should."
1.00,"I got the Crest Pro-health Clinical Gum Protection toothpaste at my local CVS. I also got the \"Invigorating Mouth Wash\" from the Pro-health line. I really wish I would've checked the reviews before buying the product because now I'm out nearly $10 and I have pretty much the same problems as everyone else. I used it last night and, almost immediately after, I felt the inside of my upper lip feel numb -- like I'd been given a shot of Novocain or something. I thought it was weird, but I wasn't experiencing anything else, so I figured there was just some numbing agent in it that was acting up. I went to bed, woke up, and now I've got the same thing as the other reviewers -- the inside of my lips is peeling, pretty sure I have some cuts or sores on the inside of my mouth, and the \"numbness\" in my upper lip hasn't gone away (I'm starting to think it's not numbness so much as it is swelling). Needless to say, I feel gypped. My teeth don't feel any cleaner nor do my gums somehow look ~miraculously better~. I know some people haven't experienced anything, but it's better to err on the side of caution. Be careful with this toothpaste. It's hard to believe that it's already affected me after one day. I definitely won't be using this again."
5.00,"Loved the toothpaste, would definitely buy it again!"
5.00,"I absolutely LOVE this toothpaste! The package says it's good for cavitites, gingivitis, plaque, sensitivity, tartar, whitening, and breath freshening. Sounds like everything you'd expect a toothpaste to deliver, right? Well it is! I grew up using Colgate, and have always stuck with Colgate, despite having been given Crest samples over the years that I just didn't like as well. Well, until recently! At a recent trip to the dentist, he pointed out some developing gingivitis. He gave me an Rx mouthwash for that, but it's all used up, and didn't seem to correct the lightly bleeding gums. So, off I went to the store to see what I could find in the toothpaste aisle. The long list of features interested me, so I decided to try this product. After using this toothpaste 2-3 times every day for a week, I can tell you that it works great, and I have had absolutely no negative side effects! My gums are no longer bleeding when I brush, the icky plaque/tartar problem I've always had on the inside of my crowded lower front teeth is completely under control, my teeth are very white, and my sensitivity in a couple of teeth is gone. I can't address the anti-cavity feature, since I've only been using this product for a week, but I've never had much in the way of cavity problems, and I don't expect a change. Also, the toothpaste tastes pleasant. What else could you ask for in a toothpaste? This one has it all! I don't understand the one prior review with complaints about this product. I have sensitive teeth and gums and have been using this product mulitple times a day for a week with no problems."
5.00,"So far, I've tried the Crest ProHealth Clinical Sensitivity plus whitening toothpaste and a ProHealth floss, and I like both products. The toothpaste in particular makes me feel like I've just left the dentists' office after a cleaning."
4.00,"This Crest \"Pro-Health Multiprotection Rinse\" is a good mouthwash choice for those needing help with dry-mouth (like me), but it it not very good tasting. My dental health is not the best due to taking prescription medication that dries out my mouth at night, which cavity causing bacteria love. This mouthwash does seem to help with the dry-mouth and also leaves my mouth feeling clean.Recommended!CFH"
5.00,"I have used primarily Crest products my entire life, and have reached \"middle-age\" still without a cavity... so I am clearly partial via my experience to Crest. Admittedly, my flossing and use of \"regular\" Crest Pro-Health has been intermittent at best. But it is interesting that a dentist friend confided that he doesn't even recommend fluoride toothpaste; he believes it is too rough (among other problematic secondary problems with fluoride) and ruins the enamel of the teeth. What he recommend is brushing gently with Crest pro-health rinse, and then the normal gargling. Now, perhaps it is habit, but I am not ready to go there and still use the Crest toothpaste. But I find it interesting nonetheless.As advertised, this does not give the alcohol burn. It is great in one sense, but am I the only one for whom the burn affirmed it was actually doing something? The taste is good, and it does seem to help with bad breath.The big question I have is, what is the difference between Crest Pro-Health \"For Life\" and just the regular Crest Pro-health? They both have 0.07% Cetylpyridinium as their active ingredient. There is only one inactive ingredient in the \"For Life\" version, which is zinc lactate... an apparent combatant against halitosis (bad breath). So it may be more a marketing strategy than a totally different formulation.So, all in all, a good product, but probably not so different than the \"regular\" to be a big deal."
4.00,"Taste and overall benefits are in line with the advertising of this product."
4.00,"I have never noticed the deffrence between the toothpastes other than the tastes, but I can tell that this toothpaste made my tooth clean, white and briter. This is my first experience. I am so happy about this toothpaste."
5.00,"I am a total \"Crest person\". I wouldn't use any other brand!! :)"
4.00,"The toothpaste felt tingly and my mouth felt clean after using it. I didn't see any obvious whitening, but I'm sure it is gradual. In any case, I felt happy with the proven protection of Crest and the possibility of a nice side benefit."
5.00,"Another amazing product from Crest! The mouthwash left my mouth feeling clean without the harsh tingle that most mouthwash products have. My breath seems much fresher since I've been using this product. It is a little pricey, but well worth it for the quality and features you get."
4.00,"Crest brand has been trusted and recommended forever! What's not to love! Ive been looking for a product that has just the right amount of fluoride to be safe for teeth, but not damaging to the body, a product that protects and strengthens tooth enamel, so teeth don't become translucent and crack. A product that keeps teeth white, and gets in between teeth, kills germs and bacteria in your mouth, doesnt foam to much and cause my chin to rash, and helps heal my sensitive teeth and gums!"
4.00,"it leaves a good clean feel after use, I really like it"
1.00,"If this gave me the option to give it zero stars I would. This product is absolutely terrible! Not only did I get that nasty slime, but eventually it left my lower lip completely raw and very swollen and the underside of my tongue is a bit swollen as well, which is posing a problem because it keeps getting caught in my permanent retainer. I actually cannot use toothpaste currently, it hurts that bad and needs to heal. DO NOT BUY THIS!!!"
1.00,"I had gum disease during pregnancy and used this toothpaste to fix that problem. I used this toothpaste for a week and found it left the dreaded film on the inside of my buccal mucosa. I stopped using it thinking it might just be some kind of additive that leaves the film. My husband used it for a few months and got painful aphthous ulcers on his lips and buccal mucosa and noticed sheets of mucosa that he could remove after brushing. He looked on amazon for some better toothpastes and found this product and the reviews confirming his findings. This product contains surfactants such as SLS which can cause aphthous ulcerations in certain people as well as other ingredients that cause desquamation of the oral mucosa. I'd beware using this product and just ensure that you use a better toothbrush, water pik, as well as flossing to treat or prevent gum disease."
4.00,"The crest toothpaste is good. My teeth felt no plaque and my breath was fresh. My mouth felt clean"
4.00,"I keep reading all these reviews of people saying their mouth and tongue burned, lost of taste and everything else. It's odd, I've been using it for a few days and haven't had one problem at all. Yes it tastes a little bad when swishing but after I spit it out then it was just a nice minty taste. It did not burn my tongue, mouth or cause any problems. My mouth feels clean and my teeth look great! I'm not sure why people are having problems? Maybe they are using too much? I only fill the lid up to the first line so it's not that much, I know some people fill up the whole cap and that's way too much. The slimy feel people are feeling I'm guessing is the peroxide because it sits on your teeth and gumline after you spit it out. All you have to do is run your tongue over your teeth and gums and keep spitting out until you feel no more sliminess. That's what I do and then there is no residue on my teeth. I like it so far!"
4.00,"Plaque control is very important for healthy teeth. I would buy again."
5.00,"I love pro health products. So I am always eager to try new ones:) Well ya'll did it again:) I loved the taste and how my teeth felt afterward. Better yet my husband....a Colgate lover actually likes using this one.....score:)"
5.00,"Gotta say I LOVE Crest's new mouthwash, have never tried Crest before and pretty much gave up on finding a mouthwash that wouldn't burn my mouth. Was totally BLOWN AWAY when I tried Crest Pro Health Mouth Wash, am a believer now!! Amazing taste, NO STING!! I'll write that again...NO STING!! My teenager is even using it...miracle in a bottle is what the label should say!! GREAT!!"
5.00,"Love this toothpaste! My 12 year old liked the flavor..she didn't find the mint overpowering like in some pastes."
4.00,"Each 6 oz tube of Crest Pro-Health whitening toothpaste is promoted to help reveal your natural white smile while fighting cavities, gingivitis, plaque, and tartar plus relieve sensitivity in otherwise normal teeth. The tooth whitening capabilities of the Crest Pro-Health whitening toothpaste is to remove surface stains. Warnings include not using this product for sensitivity for longer than four weeks unless recommended by a dentist. Products containing stannous fluoride may produce surface staining of the teeth, adequate toothbrushing may prevent these stains which are not harmful or permanent and may be removed by a dentist. Before the Crest Pro-Health whitening toothpaste, I was brushing with Crest baking soda and peroxide toothpaste. The flavor of the Crest Pro-Health whitening toothpaste is milder and more refreshing. Rubbing the toothpaste between my fingers, the Crest Pro-Health whitening toothpaste is a little grittier. However when using with our Philips Sonicare FlexCare Plus toothbrush, I don't notice any additional grittiness. I've experienced no irritation from using the Crest Pro-Health whitening toothpaste, and over the last few weeks have shown a reduction of surface stains. I wouldn't say my teeth are white, but an improvement is evident. Based on other's reactions, you may want to try a tube from the grocery before purchasing a four pack. If all goes well, this toothpaste may be a good whitening option for you. PROS: Aids in removing surface stains Fights cavities, gingivitis, plaque, and tartar Use on sensitive teeth Mild Cool flavor CONS: May cause irritation in some"
5.00,"I use mouthwash every day and this felt great. Loved that the clean feel stayed with me."
4.00,"I would absolutely use this again! It made my teeth feel great!"
4.00,"Love how it keeps my teeth feeling smooth and clean!"
4.00,"I don't really think too hard about the toothpaste we buy, but I usually always lean to Crest toothpastes. They don't taste chalky as others and they do a great job. I feel clean for a few hours after brushing, even after having a light breakfast like yogurt and a banana."
5.00,"This left my teeth feeling clean and refreshed. It also gives me great smelling breath much longer than the previous mouthwash. I haven't been to the dentist as of yet, but I can see and feel a difference in my teeth and mouth."
5.00,"Some of the best toothpaste I've had at a great price. Crest Pro Health toothpastes are all great but this really seems to do what it advertises: whitening your teeth. It's got a litle bit of grit to it that I love in toothpastes, makes my mouth and teeth feel smoother and cleaner."
1.00,"I have never had a side effect from any product, but I used this mouthwash for about 3 days and got a bad chemical burn on my tongue. I can't really eat anything and it even hurts to touch the roof of my mouth or teeth. Stay away from this product"
5.00,"This is a great toothpaste. Made my teeth feel clean and does a good job of freshening your breath. I will use this again."
4.00,"While it has a little bit of a peroxide aftertaste, it does keep your mouth feeling clean and your breath fresh."
5.00,"This was not a harsh or bad tasting product and i would continue to use it for its great results."
5.00,"No matter when I brush, I have that super clean, from the dentist clean, teeth!! Very good product!!"
4.00,"I liked the product but felt like it had too much of a medicine taste."
3.00,"I try to stick to crest but I really like a mixed toothpaste (some gel some whitening) and this was really just the gel with some grits in it. It made my mouth taste a little funny afterwards. I wouldn't say my teeth decreased in whiteness or sensitivity or anything like that from using it, it just wasn't that minty, whitening, freshness you feel like you should have after watching the commercial. Going to be investigating something else for now."
4.00,"I've been trying a couple of these Crest Pro-Health Clinical Series toothpastes lately, and this is my favorite so far. It's a little stronger than the others and the taste is better - more like a paste than the others, but somewhere in between a paste and a gel. Afterward, there is a slight aftertaste as though you just washed with Hydrogen Peroxide. I don't think that's in the ingredient list, but something similar is there. Price note: If you didn't notice, these \"fancier\" toothpastes usually come in 6 oz. tubes instead of the common 8 oz. size. This one is different as it is 5.8 oz. Just food for thought."
5.00,"I really care about the health of my mouth and so does this product. Plaque is one of the worst things that can happen to your teeth, if not taken care of properly. This toothpaste can do a lot to help by removing the film before it can harden. It will keep you and your dentist smiling."
5.00,"This has a dash of mint, not sensational, you can keep your mind on the subject. What I really liked was the firmness of the cream. It stays put on the toothbrush allowing you to place it where you desire, rather than have to chase it around in your mouth as soon as you get it in there. Feels as if something coats your teeth when you are done. No taste left in the mouth. Great product!"
5.00,"My teeth felt soooo clean... squeaky clean that is. I have enjoyed using this tooth paste, it is way better than any I have tried so far. Hopefully it will continue to keep my teeth healthy and clean! I have told others about this fabulous product."
5.00,"This product left my teeth feeling clean and my mouth feeling fresh. The feeling lasted for quite some time."
5.00,"Love the toothpaste! Great taste and leaves your mouth feeling clean and your teeth smooth!"
4.00,"A very good product, priced a little higher than I expected, but all in all good product"
5.00,"I really like the Pro Health plaque control toothpaste. My teeth feel slick and clean just like they do when I leave the dentist's office."
5.00,"A longtime Colgate user is a new fan of Crest. Love the Pro-Health toothpaste!"
5.00,"I love Crest products and that is the only brand my family uses."
4.00,"I've had periodontal problems in the past and am concerned about plaque/tartar buildup. This paste is expensive but over the long term would be cheaper than more perio work! If my dentist sees improvement over the next few months of usage, I'd continue buying it."
4.00,"It left a bit of a funny taste but I liked the way that it kept tarter buildup at bay longer then other rinses."
5.00,"I'll buy this toothpaste again!"
5.00,"it's great tasting and leaves my mouth feeling refreshed. doesnt taste like medicine. pro health clinical is everything i look for in a mouthwash."
5.00,"Usually, your teeth don't feel better than the day you have them cleaned at the dentist. These products honestly do help to keep a fresher, cleaner mouth. Great Products!"
5.00,"Left my mouth feeling fresh and clean. Didn't burn like other mouthwash!!"
4.00,"I am impressed. This is a great product. It works very well."
1.00,"First off...this is great toothpaste.  We've used it for several years and like all the Crest Pro Health stuff including the mouthwash (We dilute it in water in our WaterPik, though). But, when I received my tube of the Night toothpaste from the seller, Aris Electronics, the box was not sealed and the tube appeared to have been opened and some of the toothpaste used (or at least removed)...and, who knows what might have been added to the toothpaste remaining (not likely, but it's happened before and it is a scary world we live in!)"
3.00,"I like the burn of Listerine better. That makes me some kind of weirdo, I'm sure. It just feels like it is doing something. Crest Pro-Health doesn't burn at all, and only freshens your breath a little bit. I did not experience taste loss or peeling skin like others have complained of, but that makes me worry about what's in this stuff. My gums are a constant problem, and will turn red if I don't brush for two full minutes twice a day, floss, and use a mouth rinse. I had my gums under control with Listerine...they were a nice light pink. I switched to Crest Pro-Health for two weeks, and I feel like my gums were a brighter shade of pink and not as healthy. Not a big difference, but a slight difference. I will switch back to Listerine and confirm. This is hardly a scientific study, by the way. The other thing I don't like about Crest Pro-Health is that when you spit it out, it leaves blue clumps of residue on your sink, or wherever you spit it out. Sometimes I use mouthwash in the shower, but not this stuff. If you don't rinse this residue down the drain, it will dry and it is really hard to scrub off. Why do I give it three stars then? I think for people who can't tolerate the burn of Listerine or Scope, this is the answer, and is definitely better than not using a mouth rinse."
5.00,"My mouth feels clean and fresh! Teeth are smooth and the gum-line is plaque-free. I have spent big money on my oral care (genetics, you know!). Making sure that the products I use are effective is critical! Crest Pro-health is now on that list! Thanks!"
1.00,"Crest seems to imply that the staining is partially attributable to inadequate dental hygiene. I use a Braun Oral B power toothbrush at least 2x daily, floss daily, and my dentist jokes that I don't leave him much to do on my annual cleaning.                                                                     Well, this product sure reversed that. I used the clear \"dye-free\" version and started to notice ugly brown stains that are not removed with vigorous brushing. Glad I researched this early on -- a Web search produces multiple references to the problem -- and was able to dump the product before more damage was done."
4.00,"I like the taste of this toothpaste and I did feel it made my mouth feel fresher than other toothpastes. I also noticed my teeth looked whiter."
4.00,"I don't typically use mouthwash, but I was pleasantly surprised at how much I liked this product. It wasn't \"too much\" as some mouthwashes are--I didn't need to spit it out as soon as I put it in my mouth. And my mouth felt totally clean afterwards!"
1.00,"This toothpaste has a light minty flavor, but it's overwhelmed with a flavor of black licorice. I don't know why. It tastes really foul and my mouth feels dirty after using it."
5.00,"This toothpaste really makes you feel like it's doing its job. It leaves teeth feeling clean, mouth feeling refreshed!"
5.00,"For some reason most brick and mortar stores have stopped stocking the clean cinnamon. I am so glad that amazon sells this product because I dislike most of the \"minty\" toothpaste. Crest pro health leaves your teeth feeling clean and fresh breath - just what a toothpaste should do. I hope that amazon will continue to carry this in the future!"
4.00,"I loved the toothpaste. Great taste and I can tell that my teeth are getting whiter:)"
5.00,"Excellent Product. My mouth stays fresh and clean-feeling all day."
5.00,"I like this product, my favorite though of the line is the sensitive brand. It's right up there with Sensodyne and my teeth are pretty sensitive so I can tell when I switch to a different toothpaste from this one."
5.00,"This is the best brushing my teeth has felt in quite some time. My whole mouth felt clean and invigorated. Great stuff!! Thanks so much for the sample, my family has since switched to this brand. Good job Crest!!"
5.00,"I love the new Crest products especially the mouth wash. It left my mouth feeling extreme clean and healthy. I am not a big fan of mouthwashes because of the taste but this one was one of the better ones."
4.00,"My mouth felt so fresh after using this mouthwash. It seemed as though I was doing something to ensure better dental hygiene."
1.00,"I've been experiencing this problem for a month or two. Being a self-deprecating, 'the fault lies within'-type of person, I never considered this issue could be caused by a product I was using.I bought Crest Pro Health Whitening toothpaste based on a good experience using my sister's toothpaste when we were visiting our parents. I bought some when I returned home. I used the first tube, and bought a second. At some point in that time, I was getting sporadic episodes of having stringy 'material' around my gums, or worse - reaching the corners of my mouth. I assumed it was just 'me,' something about how my glands were producing saliva.... But, it seemed to get worse, and i found no explanation online for it....Until I began to equate the problem with the TIMING of the problem. Always in the mornings - either after I've brushed, or when I wake up after having brushed. Then, I looked online for similar stories and found account after account of what's being called \"Stringy White Mucus,\" all directly attributed to this toothpaste.I still don't know exactly what this material is. Some people speculate it's the lining of your mouth, sloughing off. I first assumed it was just gooey residue from the toothpaste, congealing into a sort of stringy paste. But, I seem to have found a response to another problem-sufferer, and the emailed reply indicates it IS an affect of the product being so strong that it tears at the lining of the mouth. Crest advises that if the experience is too uncomfortable, \"discontinue use.\" So, that's what I'm doing. Even as I write that last paragraph, I'm now aware of a stinging, raw feeling on the inside of my left cheek, presumably from where the last piece of stringy white stuff came....So, that's it. Avoid."
5.00,"This toothpaste has a nice minty flavor. It cleanses well and does not irritate my mouth or gums. I like that this toothpaste helps relieve and helps prevent gingivitis because that is sometimes a problem for me. I have not had any flare ups of my gingivitis while using this toothpaste."
5.00,"I really like that it made my teeth feel real clean and made my teeth white."
5.00,"Great toothpaste. Leaves my mouth feeling fresh and super clean and my teeth have that just brushed feeling all day."
5.00,"GREAT Product line! Definitely worth using to maintain a healthy smile in between dentist visits!"
5.00,"the taste/flavor of this toothpaste is just right, not too weak, not too strong. it left my mouth feeling fresh and clean. I can highly recommend this product, and so can my husband, who is pretty picky about his toothpaste."
2.00,"I just can't love the Pro-Health toothpaste. I always feel like there is a film in my mouth after brushing that leaves my mouth feeling pasty. My 11 yr old on the other hand loves it. She says she doesn't feel any film in her mouth and feels like her mouth is \"cleaner longer... almost to lunch time.\""
1.00,"So this morning was the beginning of my 3rd day on this product and after the first couple of days of just thinking it was working really well and keeping a clean feeling in my mouth, I realize it's more of a numb, filmy feeling that I can't really describe and it doesn't really seem to go away at all during the entire day when using it in the morning.  Things also just don't quite taste the same, it's definitely having a negative effect on my taste buds.  I also just noticed a small brown spot on one of my teeth.  I feel like this product would probably work really well at reversing gingivitis after a few weeks or months.. but at what cost? I was excited to find something that would help reverse the gingivitis problems I've been dealing with but I guess I'll have to search elsewhere because the side effects are just too much to overcome."
1.00,"Worst taste ever and i have tried many products. Not only that , but after rinsing, it is not as clear as the liquid -saw small pieces in what i spit out, sorry for being too descriptive, but this is bizarre. I also think my teeth look yellowish since i started using this. Going in the drain. Crest must be relying on first time purchasers as no one will repurchase this awful tasting rinse"
5.00,"So fresh. Love it. I am sure I will buy it in the future. I will also recomend the mouthwash to my family and friends. Thank you for an excellent product."
1.00,"Have been using it for a week. Skins inside my tongue starts to fall out, mouth feels like burnt every time. Teeth are not cleaned, dark spots appear, sore teeth and cavities developing. THIS THING DESTROYS YOUR TEETH AND MOUTH INSTEAD OF CLEANING THEM. Someone please sue crest for the damage it has done to all consumers."
1.00,"I got this from my local store and used it for 3 days. The first 1/3 of my tongue started feeling as if it was scalded by hot water. Everything tastes strange. I am glad I am not alone, but at the same time, I wonder how long it would take to get my taste back. This product causes me great discomfort and possible harm to my tongue. It is ruining all my Christmas dinners and parties. I hope I can taste food and drink normally again by the New Year. Getting my fingers crossed. Update 1-30-2014: After about 3 or maybe 5 days, the burning sensation finally went away and I could enjoy food again. Since then, I have switched to Crest's competitor's product and so far, knock on wood (or my head), I have been OK. I went on an overseas trip in January and enjoyed all the food I could. The downside of this? I gained about 5 lb. I had a sudden realization. If you could deal with the burning sensation on your tongue all day long, this product might just work for you as a weight control alternative."
4.00,"After using this product my teeth felt clean for hours, unlike other toothpaste which only has that dentist clean feeling for a short time."
4.00,"I grew up using Crest products, and have continued to do so with my own children. Now that I'm older, I appreciate Crest evolving with me, especially the Clinical line. These products deliver exactly what they promise, which is what I have come to expect from Crest. Clean teeth, less sensitivity to hot and cold, and a smooth, fresh taste."
4.00,"I think this paste made my teeth feel super clean. I wasn't as wild about the flavors as some paste, but I did think it worked fabulously."
5.00,"Makes your teeth feel clean and your mouth fresh. I like it, I'll probably buy it again."
5.00,"Crest is the brand I usually use. Love the way my mouth feels after brushing."
5.00,"We have been using Crest Pro Health toothpaste and Rinse for about two months and we just love the way it makes our teeth look and feel, so white and clean. The whole family loves it."
5.00,"Have already recommended to friends! Love this! Leaves teeth clean and fresh!"
5.00,"I was an avid Colgate user. After trying this toothpaste, I have the family officially switched. It really leaves your mouth feeling much cleaner. Even our dental visits have been remarkable since switching!"
5.00,"This is a good product for the kiddies to help with bad breath. I typically do not deal with chemicals, but every once in awhile, there is a reason and this product was a winner."
4.00,"I really like this product. The fact that it caters to the health of your gums is plus and my family likes too."
5.00,"Great Toothpaste. I've even noticed a difference in my smile."
4.00,"I can always count on Crest to make toothpaste that takes care of my teeth like my dentist does!"
5.00,"It does not have the alcohol feeling in my mouth and it really seems to work a long time."
4.00,"Have used Crest pro-health products for a while now and have had better checkups since. Love the feeling and taste they leave! They seem to be a little more expensive, but I think they are worth it."
5.00,"The pro health mouth wash makes your mouth very fresh without the over powering taste of other mouth washes. I will use the products for the next 6 months and see if it makes a difference at the dentist."
5.00,"Crest pro- health mouthwash works wonderful. It keeps my teeth white & my mouth feeling fresh with-out being to over-powering like some other brands. I had a dental check-up and my dentist was very happy & told me to keep up the good work! Thank you crest :)"
5.00,"My family has always purchased Crest toothpaste. I do like this new product, even my husband did as well. My teeth did feel clean & fresh after brushing. I do wish though in came in a bigger size, to last longer. Other than that I am satisfied."
5.00,"Well, I was impressed by the information on the product label, which has me convinced that it as good mouthwash as I can buy, but my only complaint is that it does leave a really bizarre after taste in my mouth that I can't rinse out. Maybe that means it is working? Not sure. I think I'll continue using it."
5.00,"I've only been using the toothpaste for a few days, but my teeth definitely feel and look cleaner."
4.00,"Made my mouth feel very refreshed and clean. I'm not sure whether this mouthwash can outperform others as I'm between dental cleanings, but it feels like it's working!!!"
1.00,"I had been using this toothpaste for the past month and noticed that each time after brushing my teeth, the skin inside my mouth would start to peel off. I thought that maybe I was brushing too hard or that the somewhat rough side of the toothbrush was causing this to happen, so I tried to be more gentle, but it just kept on happening. I used a different toothpaste while visiting my parents and immediately the peeling stopped. I just did a little internet research and it looks like tons of people have at the same problem with this product."
5.00,"Great product for sensitive teeth, gives a great clean feeling and flavor left in your mouth."
4.00,"I would have prefered a stronger flavor and a little bit more foaming action, but Crest makes excellent products with additional benefits."
3.00,"As a long time crest using consumer, I have no complaints about this product. One definite plus for some is that the flavor of mint is not as strong or overwhelming, so if you have sensitivities involving strong flavors, this could be a real advantage for you. It doesn't seem to foam as much as some crest products, and is a slight bit grittier, but nothing that proved a problem at our house. It seems to clean as well as any other crest product. Maybe the over 50 crowd is the new go after market for sales, so it seems to me that the way it is advertised might really be the only difference here. Not a bad product, by any stretch, but I'll still purchase whichever crest product is on sale or that I have a good coupon for."
3.00,"works really well. great taste. leaves mouth feeling clean"
3.00,"The product seemed to clean my teeth but was strong"
5.00,"I personally use the one that helps fight and prevent gingivitis and it really does work! my gums no longer bleed! which is amazing because it was a really bad problem for me! love this stuff! and it's surprisingly really affordable!"
5.00,"wow my teeth never felt cleaner or my breath fresher then when I used this."
5.00,"I am really impressed by this toothpaste, your teeth feel so clean and the feeling lasts a long time. My dentist even said he recommends this to his patients."
5.00,"I really liked this mouthwash. It didn't make my mouth burn at all. After I used it with the toothpaste, my mouth felt fantastic."
5.00,"This makes my mouth feel very clean. I like the taste too."
4.00,"This mouthwash works well when combined with the toothpaste, toothbrush and is used daily."
4.00,"This mouthwash really made my teeth feel clean but after a few uses I got use to the unusual flavor."
4.00,"I liked the way this paste made my teeth and mouth feel after brushing. Thanks."
5.00,"works great leaving my mouth clean for longer time"
4.00,"I have gingivitis and get tartar buildup fairly easily (visit the dentist every 3 months) so I'm always on the lookout for something that helps with these issues. I did feel like this toothpaste kept my teeth feeling cleaner longer. Time will tell if it helps with my overall tartar and gingivitis issues - but I will purchase this again to give it a chance!"
1.00,"This stuff left what i think is a chemical burn on my tongue to the point where i could barely taste food for 2 days, and caused really bad intense burning in my cheek. NOT GOOD...."
3.00,"This product did give my mouth a clean feeling, but I don't feel like it was better than other products I have used. The after taste it left in my mouth was horrible and it would not go away tell I brushed my teeth. Even eating didn't help, it made the food taste bad. I would not recommend this product and feel that it was very expensive compared to other products that do as good if not a better job."
5.00,"Been using this product since it was introduced, it works as described. Hope that it stays in the market forever."
4.00,"Crest has always been a standard at my house. 30 years and no cavities in my teeth, so I think that speaks a volume. The dentist gave me a sample of this flavor, so what the heck, I'll try it. Its funny compaired to regular tooth paste, a bit gritty and bubbly, but is good. Not to harsh for me, might be if you already have gum problems.  I like the flavor, the cinammon is not to overpowering, which is nice because i don't care for strong flavor in my toothpaste.  I just like a cleen feeling, and this toothpaste does well."
5.00,"With a mouth like mine, the heavy artillery must sometimes be called in. This is said \"heavy artillery.\" A dentist would probably be better but... who likes to go to the dentist? Better yet, who can afford one?! For all those that answered \"yes\" to the two previously posed questions... lucky you(you sicko's!). For the rest of us(anybody? *crickets*), there's the Crest Pro-Health Collection Kit. This comes with everything you need to revitalize your mouth except that weird little suction hose thingy and a cloth bib! Anywho, you get floss(severely underused by most), a toothbrush, toothpaste, and some mouth wash. This set is basically the Cadillac of mouth care kits... and let's face it, who wouldn't love a Cadillac? Oh you wouldn't? I see... well then, settle for a sparkling clean mouth instead because that's exactly what you'll get with this great product BOOM!"
1.00,"This mouthwash seems like a good idea by reading the label.\"Rebuilds enamel, helps prevent cavities, cleans teeth & gums, kills bad breath germs, freshens breath and no burn of alcohol\"If you are like me and like to taste food, however, I would not recommend using this mouthwash. The formula seems to numb or burn your taste buds, with a semi-permanent chemically-mint flavor. This cannot be removed or reduced in any apparent way. Yes it doesn't burn like alcohol, but that would've gone away in a minute or so. Crest Pro-Health has a much more undesirable result to your palette.After using only a small amount of this mouthwash, I cannot fully taste anything I eat for nearly 24 hours. Drinking soda, coffee, hot soup, salty crackers, etc... does not lessen the negative effects of the mouthwash.Whoever said this would be good for dieting was right - It will totally ruin food for you as long as you are using this mouthwash.I poured mine down the drain. It's not worth saving $3 to use this product instead of buying another mouthwash."
5.00,"Really like this mouthwash and will continue to buy it. Mouth feels fresh and clean without the aftertaste."
5.00,"My dental hygentist always tells me that I take great care of my mouth! I think this stuff really works! Thanks for a great product!"
4.00,"The toothpaste works really well!! I felt fresh and clean after using"
5.00,"Loved the way my teeth felt clean!! Highly recommend this toothpaste!"
4.00,"This product works and works fast, IF you have gum disease. The downside is that this product sets my teeth on fire for the first 3 minutes every time I use it. However, my red swollen nasty gums were gone in a few days use and back to healthy pink. I gave it 4 stars because it actually works. It would have been 5 stars if not for the pain it causes every time I use it. I still keep using it though because I would rather have my gums healed."
5.00,"The toothpaste tasted great and definitely whitened my teeth! It kept my teeth feeling as clean and smooth even after eating!"
5.00,"Clean long lasting feeling on your teeth. Whiter, brighter looking."
1.00,"After using the product the first time i noticed my tongue felt sort of strange but didn't think anything of it at the time. Used it the second day to brush my teeth and upon rinsing out my mouth realized that the entire inside of my mouth was numb. This numbing sensation lasted for about 20 minutes and by the time it subsided it was apparent that it burned my tongue and mouth (chemical burn?). Two days later the side effects are still there and there is difficulty tasting some foods. I have never experienced anything like this from a toothpaste before. Perhaps there was some sort of allergic reaction to this but a quick google search reveals there are many other people who have experienced this. Highly advise against Crest Pro-Health."
5.00,"I found the mouthwash to be very effective and not harsh like others. My mouth actually felt fresh hours after I initially had used it!"
5.00,"Crest Plaque Control Toothpaste promised to help prevent plaque from building up while maintaining whiter teeth. Since trying this toothpaste, my teeth have felt cleaner and appear whiter. Last week I went for my (oops!-almost two year) dental visit and I was anxious to see what my hygienist said since I tend to have a lot of plaque and my gums bleed a lot. She said that this is the best my teeth have looked! My gums didn't bleed much and I actually didn't notice the \"clean\" feeling I usually get after going to her. I guess that's because the toothpaste already took care of it. Love it!"
5.00,"Everytime I used this mouthwash, it felt like I had just got done at the dentist office."
5.00,"Happen to like this flavor, used to be in stores all over then one day Gone. As long as I can buy cases here I am Happy!"
4.00,"Each 6 oz tube of Crest Pro-Health whitening toothpaste is promoted to help reveal your natural white smile while fighting cavities, gingivitis, plaque, and tartar plus relieve sensitivity in otherwise normal teeth. The tooth whitening capabilities of the Crest Pro-Health whitening toothpaste is to remove surface stains.Warnings include not using this product for sensitivity for longer than four weeks unless recommended by a dentist. Products containing stannous fluoride may produce surface staining of the teeth, adequate toothbrushing may prevent these stains which are not harmful or permanent and may be removed by a dentist.Before the Crest Pro-Health whitening toothpaste, I was brushing with . The flavor of the Crest Pro-Health whitening toothpaste is milder and more refreshing. Rubbing the toothpaste between my fingers, the Crest Pro-Health whitening toothpaste is a little grittier. However when using with our , I don't notice any additional grittiness.I've experienced no irritation from using the Crest Pro-Health whitening toothpaste, and over the last few weeks have shown a reduction of surface stains. I wouldn't say my teeth are white, but an improvement is evident. Based on other's reactions, you may want to try a tube from the grocery before purchasing a four pack. If all goes well, this toothpaste may be a good whitening option for you.PROS:Aids in removing surface stainsFights cavities, gingivitis, plaque, and tartarUse on sensitive teethMild Cool flavorCONS:May cause irritation in some"
5.00,"I like this product and I have told others how great it is, too. I like the clean feeling and it really helps with the plaque. I have one tooth that has a big problem with plaque buildup, but Crest Pro-Health Plaque Control knocks it right out of my mouth! A+ all the way!"
4.00,"Simply said, the statement \"you get what you pay for\" is true. Although this is a little on the higher end of the budget, it's worth it. The whitening does help! The clean fresh feeling left in your mouth and on your teeth is refreshing and lasting."
5.00,"This is our favorite toothpaste and the only one we'll use now! My teeth feel squeeky clean after brushing and they're whiter everyday! Love it!"
1.00,"I saw this on the shelf in the bathroom, my wife had purchased it but nobody was using it. The dentist told me I should be using a fluoride rinse so I thought I'd give it a shot. So I start developing this strange metallic taste in my mouth that won't go away, and can't figure out what it is. My sense of smell has changed, too. My coffee especially has started smelling bad to me. I thought maybe I had a cold coming on or something. I continued using it without putting two and two together, and it was just today that the metallic taste in my mouth really started driving me nuts that I made the association with using this stuff and did a little Google searching and the first hit was the reviews here at Amazon. The thing is, I haven't used it in 48 hours (I was using it before bed and forgot to use it last night, so Tuesday evening was my last \"dose\") and the taste in my mouth is actually getting worse. I won't use it any more but I sure hope my tongue and nose start working again."
1.00,"Before I had used even half the tube, my teeth had become so sensitive that they bothered me around the clock. I stopped using it over three months ago and my teeth are still very sensitive. My dentist prescribed a special fluoride toothpaste that has helped some, but it discolors my teeth. I wish I had never, ever used the Crest Pro-Health. I never had sensitive teeth before, but now I have a hard time with cold, hot, and sweet things. Do not make the same mistake I made, and stay well clear of this dreadful, dangerous toothpaste. It ought to be taken off the market."
5.00,"Great tasting and leaves your moth feeling fresh and clean. Will buy over and over again. Our family loves this brand."
5.00,"It kepy my mouth fresh. Lasted most of the day...The taste was refreshing."
5.00,"I have never enjoyed using mouthwash. I've always found it to be quite harsh. I am now a reformed mouthwash user. Crest Complete mouthwash is the best. I don't fell like I'm using battery acid in my mouth. It's smooth yet crisp."
5.00,"This product works very well and it has great flavor. It is not too strong yet it still leaves your breath fresh."
2.00,"And no, I'm not a competitor...I don't have any form of gingivitis, but I figured I would use this toothpaste to keep myself from ever developing problems. Boy, was that a mistake! As many other reviews have states, this toothpaste horribly dried my mouth out and caused white film to come off of my gums and cheeks. I find this a tad ironic as having a dry mouth can cause you to develop gum and teeth problems.If it works wonders for you, keep on using it. For me, I'll stick to the other amazing Crest products.Crest should find a way to fix this \"dries my mouth out\" problem.Thanks for reading!"
5.00,"I love this product it really leave ur teeth so clean..."
5.00,"I love this toothpaste, it keeps my mouth fresh for a long time"
5.00,"I don't trust any other brand but Crest for my teeth. I love this product and it is just what I was looking for!"
5.00,"i always liked crest, i bought this product yesterday and i really like it. It tastes good and it helps my teeth in many different ways, fighting plaque and helping them whiten."
5.00,"I need all the help I can get to keep my teeth white. I drink a lot of coffee and Crest Pro-Health with Whitening helps them from getting darker. The flavor is good too. The mint is not overpowerig. I like the package design and the fact that it stands on end and takes up less room."
4.00,"I really like the overall feeling of the crest toothpaste. Appears that it really distribute itself in between the teeth. You had that well scrub feeling in your mouth"
5.00,"Love the taste, not too strong and doesn't burn. My teeth feel fresh and clean after using. Like Amanda, I use it on my mouth guard and it leaves it fresh and clean too."
5.00,"I really liked this product, it made my mouth wake up and feel fresh and clean. I like that it helps my gums get healthier. Would purchase this product again."
1.00,"I would give this 0 stars if I could. I've used it twice now. With the first use I thought the taste was terrible. It leaves a very stale aftertaste reminiscent of old toothpaste. It caused my tongue to feel as though it had actually lost a layer. Still I'm looking at the claims on the package and thinking this is doing me some good. The following morning I tried it again. About an hour after the rinse I had a snack and noticed I couldn't actually taste it. At lunch the same thing, everything but bitter flavors had no flavor whatsoever. Completely disturbed I tried to figure out what was going on and came across multiple references to this product causing people to lose their sense of taste.It's been nearly 20 hours now and I still can't taste. I'm reading for some it can take weeks to regain the ability to taste.How has this product not been pulled?!If anyone wants to start a class action suit by all means I'm on bored!"
3.00,"This toothpaste did not leave a clean feeling like my current toothpaste. It did not foam well and left a horrid aftertaste. I was not impressed. I mean, I would use it if I had nothing else. But I would not purchase this on a regular basis, especially with the price. Think we will just stick with Aquafresh Extreme Clean."
5.00,"I have always been a Crest lover over all other toothpastes. After trying the Pro-Health version, I am a believer that it is the best out of all of them! I have never felt like my teeth were so clean throughout the entire day! It was fabulous!"
5.00,"Crest Pro-Health makes your mouth feel fresh and clean and your teeth feel great! Thanks."
5.00,"While the product really has wonderful toothe cleansing and whitening result I ended up with a BURNT arm and also burns around ny lips. Shame because the product does thoroughly cleans your teeth. I now wrap my arm in cling foil and put paraffin oil around my lips if I need to use it. It is dangerous stuff which the manufacturer does not highlight on the packet. BEWARE"
5.00,"I really like the Crest Pro Health toothpaste. It makes my teeth feel very clean and seems whiter. I will continue to use it."
5.00,"toothpaste comes in great flavors. it cleans the mouth well and leaves your mouth feeling refreshed."
1.00,"I have to join the chorus in warning potential customers that this stuff can stain your teeth. Here you buy a product thinking you're doing something for your dental health and you end up with brown streaks at the gum line and across your front teeth. It's not pretty. I read somewhere online Crest claims only 3% of customers get stains, but it happened to my husband as well after just a week of using this. Now, the FDA must have made Proctor and Gamble put a tiny warning well out of the way of the \"official\" warning on the drug facts label. It acknowledges that the product can stain teeth, but with \"adequate brushing\" it \"may be prevented.\" So, you know, it's all your fault, right? If you absolutely must use this product for some strange reason, monitor your teeth for stains daily and stop at the first sign of streaks and darkening at the gums. Also make sure you have a dental cleaning scheduled as you may need it more than you ever have in your life. Better still, stay away from this product and keep a close eye on Crest and Proctor and Gamble products for those tiny warning labels that may contain the most important information of all."
5.00,"The new Crest Clinical rinse leaves your teeth feeling super clean and mouth super fresh. I definitely will continue to use this product!!"
5.00,"my personal experience of crest pro health clinical plaque control is wonderful... i tried it and saw the result the very first time i used it... it has a nice flavour but not too strong...it left my breath feeling fresh and clean..and my teeth too felt better ... they looked more white then before... that was amazing..."
5.00,"I haven't used mouthwash for several years because of the strong medicine flavors. This new Crest is very impressive and I love to use it. I'd make an effort to find this and not buy anything else if your store doesn't carry it."
4.00,"I have switched to purchasing my toothpaste directly from Amazon. Surprisingly, it's cheaper online - especially with free shipping through Prime - than my local retailers. ($3.88ea vs $4.00+) Bonus = not paying tax! Crest is a brand that everyone knows and pretty much stands on its own reputation. However, I have found that this particular toothpaste whitens teeth really well without the pricey tag. Kind of like all soaps being antibacterial but you pay more for ones that actually say they are antibacterial. Extra bonus - Amazon is currently running a $0.75 coupon on this toothpaste. Keep your eyes open for deals like that in the future. You can also save money by having this shipped to your home regularly with \"Subscribe & Save.\" I have never used that, however, so cannot give an opinion on how the service works or if it is worth it to save a few more pennies."
5.00,"Love Crest products and this one lived up to my expectations. I had a very fresh feeling after using and my teeth felt great!"
5.00,"This product really cleaned my teeth and made them feel fresh and new. The taste is also very refreshing."
5.00,"My teeth are white and clean. They are also very refreshed"
5.00,"Hubby loves the mouthwash. He uses it at night and in the morning. He must feel like his mouth is extra clean b/c he has been coming back for 2nd and 3rds on the goodnight kisses. Not that I am minding. :)"
5.00,"I couldn't believe how clean my teeth felt after using this product."
5.00,"I've always been a Crest user and this just solidified that fact!"
1.00,"This product will stain your teeth and turn it brown. Crest says \"whoops, sorry guys... but dont you feel like your teeth are cleaner??\"Google it. And dont waste your money."
5.00,"This is everything I want in a toothpaste and my teeth were so shiny and clean. I recommend this product"
4.00,"I have always loved the Crest line of products, so this comes as no surprise. I really like this toothpaste. It has a great flavor and leaves my mouth feeling clean for hours after brushing."
4.00,"used this toothpaste and noticed a decrease in the plaque. Great flavor to."
1.00,"I always had perfect teeth. Then I used this for 6 months. All I can say is that all the negative reviews are right and on top of all that it does the exact opposite of what it says it is meant for on the bottle. I called them about it. They said they were reporting it. This stuff should be recalled. Whatever that new ingredient is: \"cetylpyridinium chloride\" You would be well advised to look for it in everything and avoid it at all costs."
4.00,"I really enjoyed using this product! It made my mouth feel clean and healthy. I'm a fan!"
5.00,"Id recommeend this to friends and familys any day. This made my mouth feel extremely clean. I will be trying more of their products."
2.00,"This was the first time that I have bought a Crest toothpaste, and after only a week of using it, it will certainly be my last. I purchased this product due to its price and because I had a coupon, but have come to realize that it was a waste of money and energy. After using it for a week, the cap is completely gummed up and won't hardly close. Every attempt to clean it has led to a clean cap that just gets gummed up again. I was also highly disappointed with the product packaging. I was looking for a tooth PASTE when I bought this. \"Clean Mint\" doesn't provide enough information for me to know that it was actually a gel that I was purchasing."
5.00,"My family used the product and we just went to the dentist. No one had cavities! We will continue to be users."
5.00,"I have trouble with tarter buildup. This product makes my mouth feel clean and fresh throughout the day. It keeps my breath fresh and teeth feeling smooth all day long."
5.00,"I have been using Crest since I was a child. I will continue to use Crest. I always get great checkups and love the taste. My kids love the taste and so they are more willing to use Crest tooth paste."
5.00,"I found my new favorite toothpaste. It leaves your teeth feeling clean and breath smelling great."
4.00,"great crisp taste and does a great job whitening and freshening breath!"
5.00,"Ok, maybe not quite a daisy, because they are really fresh & delightfully smelling, but.. to me, I liked the taste & the fact that I really did get that fresh feeling that we all like to have. I have bought a 2nd bottle since then. Will continue to do so! Thanks, for switching me over!"
4.00,"The new Crest plaque prevention toothpaste has seemed to really work well. My teeth feel clean and great after each use! The taste is pleasant, and my mouth feels fresh for quite some time after brushing!"
4.00,"I love this mouthwash! It's alcohol-free, so it doesn't burn, but it has enough \"kick\" to make it feel as if its washed my entire mouth clean--and keeps it feeling fresh for a good amount of time!"
4.00,"it gets your teeth white and clean. it gives you fresh breath as well."
5.00,"The toothpaste is soft and melts as you brush your teeth. Very gentle. The mint is not overpowering to the point that it stings."
4.00,"My husband and I tried the Crest products and did like them. We still prefer Colgate toothpaste but the rinse, toothbrushes, and floss were good quality products that we would buy and use again."
5.00,"I'm actually really concerned by the amount of people who are having these weird, scary issues with this toothpaste. I have been using it for years with NONE of the symptoms others are talking about. It's the only type I use! I love it!"
4.00,"I love the fresh clean taste, and the feeling that my teeth are healthier as a result of using Crest Pro-Health Clinical mouth rinse."
4.00,"The mouthwash left me teeth and breath feeling fresh for several hours. I wasn't a big fan of the taste while using it, I prefer something milder, but it's well worth it because it does what it's supposed to do!"
4.00,"The textured crystals you feel in this toothpaste do a good job of cleaning off the daily coffee and tea stains, and leaving teeth feeling very smooth. I had a major mouth surgery 3 years ago that left me needing to use toothpaste for more sensitive teeth. After using this toothpaste for a while, I've not run into any problems with it causing issues in my mouth, and the formula is mild enough for my sensitive toothpaste needs. I drink a lot of hot tea every day, and prefer using toothpastes like this Crest Pro-Health that have scrubbing crystals in them that provide some daily whitening of my teeth. It's a great basic toothpaste with a traditional mint taste."
4.00,"Love that its alcohol free. Taste isn't bad and leaves your mouth feeling fresh. Would definetely recommend it."
4.00,"I used the new Crest Pro-Health toothpaste on a recent weeklong vacation. I loved how clean and refreshing my mouth felt after each use. You always want a toothpaste that feels like it continues working even after you've finished brushing. I would definitely recommend Crest Pro-Health to others!"
1.00,"This product causes horrible staining between your teeth.....STAY AWAY!  It should be pulled off the market!"
1.00,"I have sensitive teeth, so I thought this stuff would be great. I used it for about 6 weeks, and it hurt my teeth more and more every week! It's sitting under the sink, where it will probably stay until I move..."
1.00,"It taste terrible and the toothpaste cap also is hard to open and close, I hate to brush my teeth it taste so bad. I threw it away after using it about three times that’s all I could stand. I went back to Crest Baking Soda & Peroxide whitening."
1.00,"Wow, this toothpaste is awful. After using it just twice, I have dry mouth and heartburn-like symptoms. The back of my throat feels like it has chemical burns, and it feels like it's traveling down my esophagus. I have used Crest whitening with Scope and had no issue; I liked it in fact. I think it's the stannus flouride in this product that is causing the problem. All other toothpastes I have ever tried use sodium flouride. Stannus flouride is supposed to be really great for your teeth, but I just cannot use this product. After reading all these reviews, Crest really should recall the product. I feel a lawsuit coming after so many people have complained (you think these reviews are bad, just go to the Consumer Affairs website, holy cow). I wish I could give this product no stars. I just hope that these effects go away soon, it truly is awful. Thanks, Crest (tone=sarcasm)."
4.00,"I did not think I would like this toothpaste ( I am a Crest Whitening girl), but to my surprise this toothpaste over the last two weeks have done a great job. I will continue to use this toothpaste probably at night and whitening in the morning. (Can not change that quickly)"
5.00,"So far so good. This was a great purchase on Amazon with a coupon, but the coupon only could be used once. I wish Amazon could offer repeated use of coupons for this great toothpaste. Clean effect is very good."
4.00,"My wife tested this product and found that it is good, but nothing really special. She really didn't see any difference in the color of her teeth after using this for a couple of weeks. We tested two different Crest products, this and Crest Pro-Health Clinical Gum Protection Invigorating Clean Mint Toothpaste, and we both agreed that the Crest Pro-Health is much better. We both loved it. To us, this was just toothpaste, good, but nothing special. I would recommend the Crest Pro-Health instead."
4.00,"This is a nice rinse that is not overpowering. A little pricey but good product!"
5.00,"Crest pro health mouth wash left my mouth feeling fresh,and clean.I'll be buying more crest pro health toothpaste,and mouthwash in the future."
2.00,"I am pretty certain that this is the first Crest toothpaste that I have really disliked. I have used Crest toothpaste my whole life and I trust the brand to get my teeth nice and clean and give me fresh breath. However this toothpaste is the exception for me. Instead of a smooth texture this toothpaste is quite gritty. It has a nice flavor at first but after a minute of brushing the taste fades and it doesn't do much to freshen your breath. If you like a nice strong toothpaste that will kill bad breath from food like onions and garlic then I would suggest another type of toothpaste. If you don't believe me then go eat something with garlic and go brush your teeth and then ask a family member if your breath is fresh. It's almost like brushing my teeth with nothing but water. It may scrub my teeth but it doesn't make my teeth squeaky clean or give me fresh breath with confidence. I will definitely pass on this toothpaste in the future."
4.00,"That is how I felt after brushing. This will become a toothpaste staple for me."
5.00,"I love the Crest Pro Health toothpaste. The flavors are great but the way the product works is amazing. My teeth felt super clean and over the course of using the product I could tell that my teether were becoming whiter. Thanks Crest for making such amazing products."
4.00,"I am brand loyal but I must say after trying this product I will continue to use it . I have soft enamel on my teeth and I noticed within a week a differance."
5.00,"this product leaves my teeth feeling fresh and clean. very good product, good price."
5.00,"Tried pro health toothpaste what can I say awesome clean"
1.00,"This product does not even deserve one-star. It not only removed 99% of the plaque off of my teeth, it removed 99% of sense of taste. Began using Friday evening, notice that all my food tasted like wax and my tongue felt burned, by Sunday morning, I realized it was this rinse. I quit using immediately. I can't believe this product even made it on the market."
1.00,"I did not purchase this product from Amazon. I used the Crest Pro-Health CLINICAL rinse 3 - 4 times on 2 consecutive days. Inside my mouth became blistered. My lips and cheek area were swollen. For days afterward, once I began eating again, I could not taste the food. The saliva in my mouth felt like oil, which made eating more unpleasant. Eating without tasting the food and having my saliva feel like oil takes some effort! I called the 800 telephone number on the bottle. I was told I may have had a reaction to the product. Presently my throat tends to get sore easily and still, I don't seem to have as much saliva as I did before I used this product. A review is an opinion and this is mine. If it is possible to give this product no stars that would be my decision along with a warning about what could happen. I am especially concerned about children's use of this product."
5.00,"Crest and Oral B are a marriage made in heaven. My teeth are the best they have every been. My dentist and I credit it to such a great combo. Keep up the great products."
1.00,"Crest Pro-health Clinical Gum Protection Clean Mint Toothpaste, 4-Ounce (Pack of 3)I HAD THOUGHT THAT FLORIDE TOOTHPASTE WOULD BE BENEFICIAL FOR MY TEETH BUT IT TURNED OUT THAT I HAD WHITE STRINGY SKIN COMING OFF THE INSIDES OF MY MOUTH AS WELL AS I DEVELOPED RED BUMPS & BURNING ON INSIDES OF MY LIPS...I DONT GET WHAT INGREDIENT IS CAUSING THIS PROBLEM. WHEN I CALLED THE COMPANY THEY RETURNED MY MONEY PROMPTLY BUT SAID THEY HAD NEVER HEARD ANY PRIOR COMPLAINTS ABOUT THIS TYPE OF PROBLEM..THEY OF COURSE ADVISED TO CEASE USING THE PRODUCT...MY MOUTH WAS BACK TO NORMAL WITHIN A WEEK AFTER GOING BACK TO MY OLD TOOTHPASTE...WHAT IS CAUSING THIS ISSUE?"
5.00,"Toothpaste tastes great and leaves my teeth feeling very fresh and clean."
4.00,"The toothpaste is great, but the cap hinges on my tube broke on the third use also. I just wanted to let you know about the cap. I see others are having cap problems also."
5.00,"My son loves the bubble gum taste of this so much that he doesn't mind that it has princesses on it!"
5.00,"I buy a lot of different toothpastes trying to find something that works well - I was impressed by this one and will purchase it again."
2.00,"I tried the toothpaste myself and it seemed ok. My son prefers Crest Cavity protection Regular Paste. Apparently it is not \"spicy\". That's the one I should have ordered. Next time I will."
5.00,"Love this mouthwash, and the feeling it leaves you and the whiteing is a plus.."
1.00,"How could they have gone so far wrong with something as simple as toothpaste in a tube?  There are two problems with this product; the paste is too goopy, and the hinged lid doesn't snap firmly enough.  Either problem in isolation might be manageable but together they are a recipe for disaster.  Every time I fail to snap it properly, some more blue gooey stuff oozes out and makes a mess of my sink area.  Today was the last straw; our housecleaner put the tube upside down in a tooth mug (not an unreasonable place for it) and  a few hours later I found that half an inch of paste had leaked into the bottom of the cup.  I was sufficiently irritated that I decided to write this review to warn the world about this deeply flawed product."
5.00,"This was the first mouthwash I used when I started brushing my teeth again finally after oral surgery!! It was great... it had just the smallest amount of the minty fresh taste, which was great for me! I was expecting it to burn!! Husband has never used mouthwash and he loved this as well!!!"
5.00,"Crest Pro-Health Multi-Protection is an alcohol free mouth rinse which I prefer. You don't get the burn of the alcohol and still get the health benefit of killing germs, plaque reduction, prevention of gingivitis, cleaner teeth and fresh breath.I really like the cool wintergreen flavor. I wouldn't have minded if the wintergreen had had even more of a wintergreen kick but I'm still thankful for the flavor."
4.00,"I thought the toothpaste was good, but I honestly didn't feel it was all that different from all the other brands of toothpastes I use (except A&H - that toothpaste was horrible tasting). I would buy again if the price was right, but it's not something I would go out of my way to locate in a store."
5.00,"Being that I have sensitive teeth, I am always looking for something to help make my smile brighter and stave off bad breath! This product did it all! Love it!"
5.00,"I am normally not a crest user but I thought I would give this a try and I was pleasantly surprised. I really liked how clean my teeth felt after using and I liked the taste which is real important to me. Since trying I have purchased other tubes for my family."
1.00,"I poured my bottle down the drain this morning after I woke up with painful damage to the inside of my mouth. I used it for two days and two nights, and no joke it's like the stuff ate the flesh away on my lower front gums. I was worried I might have messed my mouth up permanently before I read these other reviews ... now I just hope it heals quickly. The product does not seem safe for the general population!"
1.00,"Horrible..seriously. Thought I was ill or something, the metallic taste is so strong it also makes me nauseous. I was using it 2 times a day due to dentist recommendation of a new brushing regimen combined with rinse. It's been something like 26 hours and maybe 30% better, still nauseous, everything still tastes horrible. Flabbergasted that this garbage ever made it out of testing, much less is still being sold."
5.00,"This is a great toothpaste. I love Crest products and this one is as good as all the others. The taste was good and my mouth felt super clean after using. I would buy this without hesitation."
3.00,"I have tried whitening strips before, such as Crest - the kind you slap on your teeth for an hour. Surely, I felt such products work, but this whitening mouthwash by Crest, it has the same ingredients and leave you with the same nasty feeling you have once you take off the whitening strips. You can see the whitish residue on your teeth as soon as you spit it out/use it. This is both a good and a bad thing. Good to know its sticking around when you sleep, but not good if you don't plan on brushing you teeth soon-after and you plan on eating, or, if say if you like to use mouthwash in the morning. I have used it for about a month and have not really noticed much of a different in my smile. The taste is not bad but some may absolutely hate it - its not minty, and has a bit of a chemically hint/taste. I recommend getting the trial or smaller size if you are unsure or if you truly perfer a minty taste this might not be for you."
5.00,"My teeth feel like I've just had them cleaned at the dentist!!"
4.00,"I liked the product but not the after taste. It left my teeth feeling clean though."
5.00,"This product arrived early than I anticipated, that was great. I must say I was pleasantly suprised in every way."
4.00,"I really like the toothpaste but it is rather expensive. Mouth felt clean and fresh for a long time after brushing. Would definitely be a regular item in our house if it was a little cheaper in price."
5.00,"my daughter and I both were impressed with the Crest. It left our teeth really clean and our mouths fresh. I recommend it to everyone who wants clean teeth"
4.00,"Leaves breath and teeth feeling fresh and clean. It doesn't have the burning alcohol sensation neither. It does foam a little more than other rinses though."
1.00,"After using this mouthwash the first time, I had a strong bitter taste in my mouth ALL day and everything tasted bitter. This mouthwash has some sort of bizarre effect on the tastebuds, and it affects those like me who have been certified as supertasters VERY strongly. If you don't want everything you eat to taste incredibly bitter all day, AVOID this."
5.00,"Using these dental products made my smile brighter, healthier, and made my mouth feel cleaner! I would recommend any and all of these products to my family and friends."
4.00,"Great tasting and my teeth felt like they just had a cleaning at the dentist. Would definitely recommend it."
5.00,"Plaque control is no longer an issue with me due to the effectivness of Crest Pro Health Clinical"
4.00,"after using this toothpaste I did have a clean feeling on my teeth but I am wishing for a quicker whitening process"
5.00,"Love the clean and fresh from the dentist feeling I get using this toothpaste!"
1.00,"Well, I've used the AIM brand cheap gel toothpaste for nearly forever. I generally prefer gel-type toothpastes over the white paste kind because I think they taste better. I expected this toothpaste to be decent enough since it's Crest and a gel type toothpaste... The taste is kinda bad at first, but after brushing I found it left an even more awful aftertaste in my mouth that just wouldn't go away despite me drinking several cups of hot tea. Plus, there's a nasty gritty texture to this toothpaste that if I had known about would've made me choose a different toothpaste entirely. To make matters worse, I just saw all the other negative reviews. There are quite a few, and they are all apparently about the same thing: people who have been using this have experience terrible side effects from their mouth skin cells falling off to their lips burning and cracking. I haven't experienced stuff this bad, but it has left me with a strange scratchy sore throat about an hour after use. I'm certainly not going to keep using this to find out if it'll get worse. This is going right in the trash and I'm sticking with my cheap but non-dangerous AIM brand toothpaste."
5.00,"The rinse taste great and is long lasting. Good product."
5.00,"I have sensitive teeth/gums, so I am always wary about trying new products. This toothpaste was awesome!! It didn't affect my sensitivity and left my mouth feeling really clean! This has become my new favorite toothpaste. Definitely recommend to other sensitive teeth sufferers."
5.00,"I didn't buy this on Amazon, but on impulse as my local grocery had a deep discount on some apparent closeouts.I should say that, despite using a good toothpaste, a sonic toothbrush, floss, a Waterpik-type device, and an expensive prescription mouthwash, my problems with plaque and tartar, which my hygienist thinks I inherited, are such that my insurer and I have had to pay for professional cleaning and descaling every three months, rather than every six months. After only a few days of using this new mouthwash, I noticed a big difference in the amount of buildup on my teeth, both in terms of new deposits (none) and in the effectiveness of my toothbrush in removing deposits that I had thought only a dental visit would remedy. It worked much better than the prescription mouthwash, my mouth feels cleaner for longer, and it claims to strengthen the tooth enamel, which in itself would save money in the long run. My spouse was slow to open his own bottle, but began to use it after hearing me rave, and has used it religiously ever since, so I know he likes it, too.Note: a little goes a long way with this mouthwash. There is a two teaspoon measure on the bottom of the inside of the cap, and that, twice a day, is all that is needed. If you have a small mouth like mine, you might even be able to use less."
5.00,"I have found my new toothpaste!! I love this product...made my mouth feel clean and fresh!!!"
1.00,"Do NOT use this product or any of the pro health products!!!                                              Like many other people I had a loss of taste but also had extreme pain, swollen glans! I used this product for aprox a year and thought that I was having other issues due to medical reasons. However once those issues were explored and stopped taking all the medicines I was still having extreme pain in mouth. After going to many drs and dentists with no one knowing what was wrong, my sister found this report about a lawsuit regarding crest pro health and loss of taste, browning of the teeth, swollen glans and a few other symptoms. It made me think maybe that was the problem so I stopped using it and the pain lessened with in a couple of days, still have some but it has only been a short time and am still waiting for my taste to return to normal. So please do NOT use and pass the info on to all who will listen!"
4.00,"This toothpaste left my mouth feeling clean and fresh."
1.00,"I was really disappointed in this mouthwash. I have used Crest products for many years and this is by far the worst I have ever used. The mouthwash has an unpleasant taste (especially compared to brands like Listerine) and a bad after taste. I love Crest toothpaste but I would not recommend this mouthwash to anyone."
5.00,"This is a great toothpaste with a good flavor. It is pricey, though."
1.00,"I purchased this product years ago, and recently bought it again to give it a second chance. However, both times I have experienced the same side effect: loss of taste. I would use the mouthwash at night, and my sense of taste was affectedly negatively throughout the entire next day. Nothing tasted the way it should, to the point that I couldn't even finish eating it. Crest offers refunds on their products, so I mailed in the receipt and UPC from the bottle. Over a month later, the mail was returned to me saying, \"P.O. Box Close.\" I also tried posting a review for the product on Crest's site, however, it never appeared with the other reviews. It contained no slander; only an objective review of my experience. I'm not sure what to do now, but I will never buy this product again. I wanted to let people know that experiencing loss of taste is a possibility.Crest's website even includes the following information in their FAQ's:\"Crest Pro-Health Rinse does not cause permanent taste alteration. Oral Care Products containing CPC, the active ingredient in Crest Pro-Health Rinse, may cause a temporary aftertaste or temporary change in the taste of food in a small percentage of people. CPC stays in the mouth for long periods of time which allows the rinse to provide its 12-hour benefit. Changes in the taste of food typically go away shortly after you stop using the product.\"If they know this is a possibility, it should be easier to obtain a refund if you are not satisfied."
4.00,"Doesn't taste \"mediciny\" and lasts really long, but it is a little more expensive."
4.00,"I like the product, but I can't overlook the cost when I can buy just the regular Crest for cheaper."
5.00,"I've always liked Crest toothpastes. The Pro-Clinical line is quite good."
5.00,"My dentist gave me a sample of this and I feel it's the best product for me. It no longer feels like the hygienist is taking the top layer of my teeth off. I have been using for about 3 years and decided to buy from Amazon because the price is right."
5.00,"This mouth wash tastes great and has a nice minty feeling. I will definately be buying this again"
5.00,"The is a great product line....My teeth never felt and looked so good!!..Love it!!"
5.00,"I totally love it, it feels fresh and clean. I can also see improvement too."
5.00,"This mouthwash leaves you feeling fresh and ready to start the day. You can feel confident your breath is fresh and clean."
5.00,"My family loves Crest Pro-health mouthwash.The first reason is it taste great. If it didn't taste good we wouldn't use it no matter what the benefits were. That it kills germs,reduces plaque,helps prevent gingivitis freshens my breath and allthe rest is just an added bonus ."
5.00,"As always, this product is a quality product. My teeth feel great and my mouth clean after brushing. It is my first choice, always."
4.00,"I got this toothpaste early this month and I am very impressed on how I feel after I brush my teeth. They feel clean and fresh. Highly recommended."
4.00,"Since I was a child Crest is the only toothpaste we have ever used. I loved this toothpaste, it cost more than most of their toothpaste, but it does seem to be better than their other toothpaste."
3.00,"Decent product. A lot of people are complaining about the staining from stannous fluoride. Doing some research you see that stannous fluoride is a very powerful anti-bacterial agent that really does help getting rid of the bateria that causes gum disease. I've talked to dentists about the stains and it is easy to remove in your regular cleanings. They are right they came right off on my cleaning. I've also found it seems to stain the plaque on your teeth and not your actual teeth (but I'm not sure about that). Bottom line is if you have issues with your gums I would throw Crest Pro-Health into your routine and possibily rotate it so you lessen the staining. However I would like to point out that I have not had that much staining from it. But the fluoride might be causing a bitter aftertaste in my mouth. In the end...$4.00 for this toothpaste is a much better deal than $20 for the prescription stannous rinses."
5.00,"I really like Crest products in general, so I wasn't surprised by the quality of this toothpaste. My teeth felt very clean after using it."
5.00,"Love this toothpaste. Teeth feel clean and i like the taste. Will be buying this product again."
1.00,"The morning after I used this product my tongue felt like I had burned it on hot pizza or tea, but I hadn't. I didn't realize it was due to this horrible product until a few days later. I poured it down the drain and am still waiting for my tongue to heal."
4.00,"I was impressed with how fresh and clean my mouth felt after using it! It lasted long too."
5.00,"I loved the way my teeth felt after brushing. I have definetely found a new tooth paste!!!"
5.00,"Great product! Crest is the best for quality and price!"
4.00,"I liked the way my teeth felt clean and I like the taste of the toothpaste not too strong."
4.00,"I have been using this since my dentist gave me a sample. This has been a great product for me. I have sensitivity and dry mouth. This reduces sensitivity without causing irritation. The flavor is fine. The texture is pretty gritty but I actually like that in a toothpaste. I just read these reviews and I see that some people have had trouble with it. I am really surprised. This has been great for me and does not exacerbate dry mouth."
5.00,"I really like the rinse, good flavor and it last for a while"
1.00,"I used this mouth wash for 2 days straight. I used it once at day. 3rd day I woke up with horrible jaw pain! I couldn't really eat because it was painful to open my jaw. It felt like it was getting stuck, like if I was getting locked jaw! I stopped using it for 3 day and the pain went away. I used it again and the pain was back the next morning! So I figured it was the mouth wash after that..0"
4.00,"Makes my teeth feel clean, has a good taste. Just had a cleaning so we will see how well it keeps them clean in 6 months."
4.00,"This product left my teeth feeling extra clean for longer than my usual toothpaste. I will be changing brands. I liked the taste of the toothpaste and the aftertaste."
4.00,"Good product but I still prefer Colgate Total toothpaste"
5.00,"After being diagnosed with periodontal disease, I wanted to find a toothpaste that would help my condition. I can honestly say that Crest Pro-Health really does the job! My husband even noticed a major difference compared to other brands. Thank you Crest!!"
4.00,"I was surprised that the toothpaste worked as well as it did. I'm a teeth fanatic and it made my teeth feel so fresh and clean. I would definitely recommend to friends."
5.00,"I loved this product. The flavor was smooth, not overwhelming, and didn't give a burning sensation. My mouth felt very refreshed after rinsing. I'd highly recommend it."
5.00,"I do not expect anything different from a new toothpaste no matter what it advertises. After brushing before bed, I woke up in the morning to breath that wasn't nasty enough to knock out an elephant. This was shock but a good one for a change!"
5.00,"It left my teeth and mouth feeling very clean and refreshing"
4.00,"This is a good product but it seems to have a aftertaste that isnt so pleasant. It foams up when your using it and has a bit of peroxide taste but overall I think it is a good product since it is a name brand and it does seem to work good"
5.00,"Love how it doesn't contain alcohol and still does its' job."
5.00,"I like that is doesnt burn your mouth. Love this product!"
5.00,"i love thefresh feeling it leaves in your mouthit s also minty taste"
5.00,"I get the fresh from the dentist's office feeling each time I brush..it's soooo wonderful!!!!"
5.00,"Love this product! It leaves your mouth feeling fresh and clean, like you just left the dentist."
5.00,"I love using products that have been improved by trusted brands. Dental care is important to me and using a brand I know and trust is also important. This product really cleans your teeth and helps keep the gums healthy."
5.00,"This is probably the most complete kit for clean teeth I have ever owned. I love the toothbrush with it's various types and shapes of bristles. It feels like no spot on my teeth is being missed. I already loved the toothpaste, I've been using Pro-Health toothpaste for a good while now and I am very satisfied. What makes me really like the toothpaste for this kit is the tube. It's the type of tube that can stand up, because it has a big flat top. Now I don't have to put the toothpaste in my medicine cabinet. I can just let it stand on my sink. The mouthwash is good too, which is something I've been using before I received this kit. It does not have a painful sensation like Listerine does. I have to admit though, I haven't used the dental floss yet. If I decided to use it, I may update this review. This would probably be a good, practical present for a college student that's going away from home. So if you haven't got the message, it's a great kit."
1.00,"I was researching on what could make me lose taste overnight. I then came across all of this and let me tell you how relieved I am to know I don't have a brain tumor or Alzheimers!! I just got this mouthwash 4 days ago and nothing has flavor! I swear I went on an eat-a-thon just to see if I could taste anything!! Thankyou for the reviews so I know what to do.....call the company and get a refund!! Crest Pro-Health Clinical Deep Clean Mint Rinse 32 Fl Oz"
5.00,"My teeth are super clean after using this toothpaste. I will definitely be buying this again!"
4.00,"I like the Mouthwash, left a nice clean feeling without any burning."
4.00,"Really leaves your mouth feeling clean. A good additional to the Crest family of products."
5.00,"This line of oral care products keeps my mouth feeling fresh & clean!"
1.00,"Horrible scary symptoms!!! Terrible experience with Pro-Health. If not for the blogs and reviews about the products - who knows how long I may have suffered along with many others. Please sign the petition at [...] and let's get Proctor and Gamble to admit the problems and take action!!!"
5.00,"The Crest Pro Health toothpaste made my teeth feel extremely clean. It lasted most of the day. I would reccommend this to anybody wanting to find a good new toothpaste."
5.00,"I like to use this once twice every day: once in the a.m. and once in the p.m. I think it works great. I would recommend this product to anyone. :)"
5.00,"I think the toothpaste made my mouth stay 'from the dentist clean' just like it said it would"
4.00,"I love how clean it made my teeth feel. It made my whole mouth feel fresh and clean."
4.00,"I bought this on subscribe and save and ended up getting 20% off so it was a great deal. The toothpaste is really gritty though, but for the price I can live with that."
5.00,"Upon receiving a bottle of Crest Pro-Health Multiprotection Clean Mint Rinse from the Amazon Vine program, I started using it every morning after brushing my teeth, and maybe once in the evening before going out to dinner or socializing. I think it really does the job: without coming on too strong and tasting overpowering, it nevertheless freshens my breath for hours after using it. And it does this via an alcohol-free formula, which is a nice plus (alcohol finds its way into my life in enough areas already, thank you). I trust that the product's other stated claims are true- in particular, that it really gives users a leg up on plaque- and if so, I'm really happy. But the fact that it definitely does a great job (again, without being overpowering) in freshening my breath, is in itself enough of a reason to keep using it!"
1.00,"Like many other reviewers, I had a terrible experience with this product. Shortly after starting it I had a salivary gland infection and then I noticed increasing tooth sensitivity. I attribute both to this awful, and more importantly, dangerous product."
5.00,"I had braces two years ago and I always had issues with my gums swelling. Since my braces came off I still had problems with swollen gums. After using this toothpaste combined with the vitality spin toothbrush, I have noticed the swelling go away completely. My friends and family have, who did not know I was using this product, noticed my teeth had become whiter. I absolutely love this toothpaste to the point that I now brush my teeth three times a day. I feel so refreshed after using this product. I am surprised at the negative reviews because after years with other toothpaste products, this is the only product that left my mouth feeling fresh. No burning, no peeling."
5.00,"I have researched toothpaste (yes, really) and found this to be the best for a number of reasons. We like the cinnamon flavor which is hard to find. I love Walmart for stocking this, having a best price, and shipping it fast to me."
4.00,"My teeth felt really clean, longer! A little pricey for me, but great product."
4.00,"Very clean and fresh taste. Not gritty. Loved it! All family members used it and it was a favorite."
5.00,"Better than Listerine..it doesn't burn like the first one. Super like!!"
4.00,"I'm always worried when I buy a new toothpaste for my son. I think he won't like the flavor and that will turn him off to brushing his teeth altogether (mommies and daddies will know what I mean about one bad instance ruining a kids outlook on something they once loved). My son likes this toothpaste and his new Crest Spin Brush and ASKS to brush his teeth! I couldn't be happier - except of course if this toothpaste were all natural (which is why it gets only 4 stars)."
4.00,"I like the Crest alcohol free mouthwash. I was highly concerned when I saw all the negative reviews that there must be something wrong with me. But it tastes great and doesn't burn."
5.00,"I loved this toothpaste as did the rest of my family, the taste wasnt overpowering and my teeth felt like I just came from having my teeth cleaned."
5.00,"I love Crest Pro-Health for Sensitive teeth and find it hard to get locally. I order several at once to save time."
4.00,"I really felt like this toothpaste did an excellent job cleaning my mouth. The clean feeling lasted all day long! I didn't care for the taste, but it's not that important to me."
5.00,"I love this toothpaste my teeth have never feeled so clean!!"
5.00,"This Crest toothpaste is great, made my mouth feel fresh and clean, my teeth white, smooth and shiny. I like it and will definitely buy it again and refer it to my friends."
5.00,"I thought the mouthwash was great, but did not see a huge \"Clinical\" improvement. Would recommend though."
5.00,"I love how clean my mouth was and my dentist was happy too!"
5.00,"My mouth felt clean and I think it worked well. This is a product I will continue to use."
5.00,"Sock it to me Crest! Your products never fail. My mouth felt fresh and teeth very clean and the brush works great. I think my dentist is going to be pleased again."
5.00,"Loved this toothpaste. Especially great in combo with the mouthwash."
2.00,"I gave the remainder of the bottle away and I won't be buying this again."
5.00,"This is the only brand our family uses. Keeps teeth clean & white."
4.00,"I liked this mouthwash, but the price could be a little better. It cleans my whole mouth and lasts."
5.00,"I loved how smooth and clean my teeth felt using this toothpaste. I also enjoyed the taste."
3.00,"I was not really thrilled with the mouthwash. It seemed to leave a odd taste in my mouth. Not sure why though. Maybe it was just me? I think I'll stick to my other brand on mouthwash. But I would recommend this to others to at least try!"
1.00,"This is an absolutely horrible product. I cannot believe I got suckered into buying a 4-pack of this garbage. After 3 days of use, my teeth became extremely sensitive. My gums and teeth had this dull pain all the time and anything hot or cold was agony. I have never had a problem with sensitive teeth before so this was new to me that a toothpaste could cause this. Very odd considering it \"claims\" to help with sensitivity, if helping means give you sensitive teeth then mission completed. I immediately stopped using the toothpaste and threw all 4 packs in the garbage. I went back to my old toothpaste and everything is fine now.I can also agree about the lousy cap that doesnt close and the runny paste that leaks out.Crest should be ashamed for putting out such a horrible product. Customers should avoid this toothpaste."
4.00,"This is the first time I tried Crest clinical pro health. I will continue using it as the taste was good and end results were very clean teeth."
4.00,"Although I didn't actually like the product while it was in my mouth, the next day my teeth felt very clean. While using the product, there was a weird taste and a white residue was left in my mouth."
4.00,"I liked the mouthwash - I would definitely buy it again."
1.00,"CREST PRO-HEALTH CLINICAL GUM PROTECTION TOOTHPASTE AND MOUTHWASH Do some research before you use it!!!!! This is a statement of concern about CREST PRO-HEALTH CLINICAL GUM PROTECTION TOOTHPASTE AND MOUTHWASH. I have always had healthy gums and teeth and have always taken pride in my smile and the health of my mouth. Because I am over 60, I want to do everything possible to protect my gums and teeth. About 8 months ago, I looked at various dental products (toothpastes and mouth washes) and decided to try these products, Crest Pro-Health Clinical Gum Protection Toothpaste and the Pro-Health Mouthwash. I started using these products about eight months ago. I had a dental check-up about three months after starting to using these products. Instead of my regular dentist say, \"I don't know what you are doing, but keep it up which has always been his comment after examining my mouth and teeth, to 'Hmmmmmm\". My gums surrounding my lower front teeth were starting to pull away from my gum line. And, as reported by my dental hygienist, there was a build up of dental calculus that I have not had before. I was shocked and I got really worried. I told my dentist that I had this metallic taste in my mouth and that my gums and teeth feel sensitive. I asked him what the problem was and what was causing it and he said he wasn't sure. This is some, but not all of what I experienced; loss of taste and smell (to some degree), white filmy slime all over the inside of my mouth that comes out in strings about ten minutes after brushing in the morning and at night, a metallic taste in my mouth, discoloring of my teeth, gums pulling away from teeth, sensitivity of my mouth, blisters on the roof of my mouth, a chalky white tongue that I could not get back to normal, even after brushing it. Not knowing what was going on, I continued to use the Crest Products. But, I tried to figure out what could be causing my mouth problems. I am in good health, so it is not health related. I brush at least twice daily and floss every day, just as I always have. I went online and keyed in, What is that slimy white stuff that I get in my mouth after brushing my teeth? I was shocked to find that hundreds, if not thousands, of consumers using CREST PRODUCTS have experience the same symptoms! I was relieved to find that I wasn't alone, that many other people have experienced the same thing. But, I was disgusted to learn that a reputable dental company, CRESTby Proctor and Gamble, was responsible. I have stopped using these dental care products. As soon as my mouth heals, I will go in for my semi-annual dental visit and cleaning and talk to my dentist about what I found in my online research. I am not sure how I am going to rectify the damage caused by your products, but it is going to have to be rectified. In the meantime, I hope Crest Pro-Health Clinical Gum Protection Toothpaste and Mouthwash are pulled off the store shelves."
5.00,"Love this toothpaste, makes your teeth feels so clean"
5.00,"My teeth always look so clean after I use it and I love the flavor."
4.00,"I really like the clean feeling that I get when I rinse with this mouthwash!"
5.00,"This is by far my favorite and from now on only mouthwash I will ever use. I like the foaming action which shows me it is hard at work. Feels and tastes great and leaves me with a dentist clean mouth."
3.00,"I know it's not technically a mouth freshener, but for the price, I'd rather use another popular name brand that kills germs AND freshens breath...this left a bad after taste in my mouth."
5.00,"I love Crest Products and Crest Prohealth Clinical Toothpaste is fantastic! My teeth feel awesome and there's no bad after taste or chalky feeling in my mouth like some other brands can leave."
5.00,"This product makes your teeth feel just from the dentist fresh!"
5.00,"It was awesome... made my mouth feel wonderful!! SO fresh & clean - not gritty. My husband loved it as well."
5.00,"This is a really nice product...it really gets your teeth super clean"
3.00,"I'm giving this product 3 stars, because I am not sure what else to do. It's in the middle of the scale. The sample of the product I got for review was not sealed when I got it, so I am not about to actually use it. Who knows why it was not sealed. Some things I would like to note. There is only one active ingredient, stannous fluoride. It may be at a very slightly higher level than in other toothpastes on the market. But does it handle all these problems that it claims to better than the others with only this small difference? I'm a bit skeptical. As a consumer, it would be hard to evaluate these claims. In addition, the product is said to defend against surface stains on teeth, yet it is stated on the package that \"products containing stannous fluoride may produce surface staining of the teeth.\" Recall, the only active ingredient in the product is stannous fluoride. It is stated on the packaging that this product defends against dental conditions that people over 50 experience. Seems to me that people under 50 experience much the same problems - cavities, plaque etc. Checking over the packaging, it seems that \"this toothpaste was selected for people over 50 because it has a smoother formulation.\" Makes me wonder about the kind for people under 50. Is this product actually better than what was already out there, or is this just a marketing gimmick? I always wonder about things like this. I'm giving it 3 stars, but I won't be trying it, as explained above. Unsealed packages and red flags suggesting marketing gimmicks turn me off. Comment"
5.00,"I love how clean and fresh my mouth feels when I use this toothpaste. I also feel like I am doing something healthy for myself when I use it."
5.00,"I really liked the toothpaste. My teeth felt so clean."
5.00,"I don't think I will ever use another toothpaste. My mouth feels fresh, and stays fresh all day. Since I'm a smoker I am very particular about my teeth. I don't want to look like I'm a smoker even if I am one. And since using this product along with the mouthwash, I've noticed a complete difference in my teeth. I recommend this product to anyone who wants whiter teeth and keep them healthy at the same time."
5.00,"I really liked this toothpaste. Left my mouth feeling very clean."
3.00,"This had a nice taste, will probably use often.The only thing i dont really like its how expensive it is."
4.00,"This toothpaste was really good. It left your teeth feeling really clean & didn't leave a \"paste\" film afterwords."
4.00,"Teeth really felt clean and fresh! Didn't bother my sensitive teeth either. Will use again."
4.00,"My teeth felt cleaner than when I brush with other toothpastes."
4.00,"I loved the mouthwash, but the price is rather on the high side. There are too many generic mouthwashes out there, to pay this price"
4.00,"Tastes good. Teeth feel clean after brushing. Though I haven't used it long enough to testify to the effectiveness of the plaque control. Time will tell."
1.00,"My girlfriend and I switched to Crest Pro Health toothpaste about 3 months ago. I immediately noticed that my lips were chapping more but I thought it was just because with summer here, I was getting dehydrated. Then, when the inside of my cheeks started shredding and peeling CONSTANTLY, I mentioned it to my girlfriend and was amazed when she told me her cheeks and the roof of her mouth were doing the same thing. A little research and I found out the same thing everyone here is complaining about, it's CREST PRO HEALTH TOOTHPASTE that was causing it. We switched to another brand and the problem INSTANTLY went away. Come on Crest! It's ok to continue to sell a product that you know is SHREDDING people from the inside out? I'm DONE with Crest products! Sounds like class action lawsuit time to me!"
4.00,"I didn't get as much of a burn like I do with other mouth washes, which is good if that turns you off from using mouth wash. Other than that it didn't seem like it worked any better than other mouth washes, but I guess it's more of a behind the scenes helper. Good product, average value."
5.00,"I have sensitive teeth, this makes it difficult to find a toothpaste that actually leaves my teeth clean and feeling clean without hurting. I am impressed by the pro health line of products. They leave my mouth feeling and looking as clean as possible."
4.00,"Would buy again, not much noticeable whitening afftect"
5.00,"i like how this paste makes my mouth feel - my teeth also seem to feel 'cleaner' after a brushing... i have used many types of dentrifice over the years, starting with toothpaste powder when growing up as a child... there are pastes, gels, and nowadays, a host of other products one can choose to clean the teeth (the least expensive of which is baking soda; NIH did a study on it, concluding that Arm & Hammer was the best brand to use) but i have found that this dentrifice works well for me - it's now a staple in the casa"
5.00,"I love the Crest ProHealth toothpaste! My teeth were very sensitive after having my son just a couple months ago. The Pro Health toothpaste is the only one that really cleans great and is comfortable on my teeth. My teeth don't hurt and I get a fresh white smile."
5.00,"I am a fan of the whole Crest Pro Health lineup; from mouthwash and toothpaste to their floss. This mouthwash helps my mouth feel truly clean and has a good flavor without being overpoweringly strong. I've been using this brand for over three years now and I'm a satisfied customer."
5.00,"great taste, great protection this is a great product for protecting your teeth"
4.00,"I liked how clean my mouth felt but it did leave a after taste in the morning. blah..."
1.00,"I only used Crest Pro Health for about 3-4 days when I woke up and noticed a funky coating on my tongue. I had just been getting over a cold so I thought it might have to do with the cold I had. Then my gums became bright red and irritated, my tongue was swollen and numb and the inside of my cheek was inflamed, swollen and irratated. My inside skin of my cheeks and lips felt so swollen and when I tried to drink or eat my mouth was burning. I went to urgent care because the pain was so uncomfortable. I still didn't realize what had caused this and thought I had an infection from my cold. My ears and sinuses were still draining so the doctor thought it could have something to do with my sinus infection. He prescribed amoxicillan but I stopped using the toothpaste too and this morning it is still very sore but I think it feels better. I also have dry mouth that no amount of water seems to cure and bad breath. I decided to google the crest pro health when I got home from the doctors because that is the only thing I had done differently since I started having the symptoms and now I know it was the toothpaste. Do not use this product!"
5.00,"I have problems with gingivitis and this product has helped keep my mouth clean. I am hoping that my dentist sees a difference also."
4.00,"It makes my mouth fresh even after drinking coffee. It has whitened my teeth. I won't switch unless Crest comes out with something better"
5.00,"Loved it- I have tried others in the past and this one is great!!! My mouth feels so fresh and clean afterwards!!"
4.00,"love this toothpaste. It taste good and works great. I have even had a few people ask me what toothpaste I've been using because my teeth have looked so good."
3.00,"We normally use Crest 3D White. Did not see a significant difference with the Pro-Health. We bought the plaque control and have not used it long enough to comment on the reduction of plaque."
5.00,"I purchased the sensitive version and love it. Very happy with this product."
5.00,"Excellent product, my teeth felt polished after brushing.There was no yucky taste or residue either."
4.00,"I love the clean feeling my teeth are left with after using this! Just like going to the dentist!"
1.00,"I used this toothpaste for about 2 months before the horror of what I was putting in my mouth set-in. While I didn't particularly care for the taste of the product, I had always trusted the Crest name and assumed this product would hold up to previously experienced quality standards. Wow, was I wrong. After my husband and I started using our 2nd tube of this product, I began to experience what I believed were canker sores inside my mouth. Large lesions followed, and then swelling and hives on the outside of my lips. My tongue felt numb or chemically burned, and these symptoms went on for a week before I called my dentist. She recommended it could be stress, and to wait another week and let her know how I was doing. She also recommended I make sure I brushed my teeth twice daily. Little did she know she was sentencing me to two more weeks of incredible pain, and open sores. The sores were on every bit of soft tissue inside my mouth; from my gums, to under my tongue, my cheeks, the back of my throat and the roof of my mouth. They became so bad, I sought a MD's opinion who prescribed me a mouth paste to apply on the lesions, but he was stumped as to what the cause could have been. It wasn't until I woke up one morning and realized the sores of that day were most prevalent in the areas of my mouth that the toothpaste most likely settled in when I brushed the night before. (both sides of the inside of my lips where the brush always rubbed, the area where the gums met my cheeks on top and bottom and in the back of my mouth and throat) That morning, it finally dawned on me it must be the toothpaste. Thank God I figured this out. I stopped using this product 4 days ago and am almost completely clear of the sores and lesions. Please Crest, do the right thing and recall this product immediately. Until I see you stand up and do the right thing for your consumers, I will go out of my way to never purchase another Crest or Proctor and Gamble Product."
5.00,"Kept mouth clean and fresh most of the day, tastes good too"
4.00,"This sure does a good job but I would not say it is better than others on the market. Hard to tell without using for extended period of time."
5.00,"Makes your mouth feel amazingly clean! The kind of clean you feel right after you leave the dentist!"
5.00,"My husband love it, He liked the freshens in his mounth for hours. Thank you for this opportunity :)"
4.00,"I love that it is does not have the typical medicine flavor of a mouthwash, but I have yet to notice a difference in freshness or cleanliness."
5.00,"I grew up using Crest and it is my favorite. This crest Pro-Health just makes your teeth feel like they are sparkling. The taste is great, the clean is great and I am confident that it is good for my teeth since it is by Crest."
4.00,"I have always had problems with my gums. I tried the gum care and I was very pleased. Within a few weeks, I actually noticed that my gums were no longer bleeding during brushing. I also didn't need mouthwash because the taste was pleasant. It has a tendency to run a little bit out of the tube but overall I would absolutely use this and buy it again. Thank you!"
5.00,"It works very well, but it is also very expensive comparatively."
4.00,"I'm not a big mouthwash user, but I did like this product. The taste took some getting used to. But overall, I like it. Makes my mouth feel clean."
4.00,"I have been using this product for more than eight months and I have noticed the difference. I have not seen any plaque on my teeth and they are whiter, too."
4.00,"Left teeth feeling clean and mouth fresh. My whole family liked the toothpaste."
5.00,"I was really surprised at how much I liked this product! It's a little pricey, but well worth it!"
4.00,"On a pure performance level, I LOVE this toothpaste. It absolutely makes my mouth feel clean and fresh. It does not foam up as much as some other toothpastes, but the effect and feel of it make this a real winner. The downside is that I think this is priced outrageously for the amount of toothpaste you receive. Is it worth that much more than a $3 tube of a different toothpaste? I can't honestly say it is. The rating gets docked for that. If you Love this, as I do, you may want to look for the 2-pack when they come out with it. Also, note that this comes in different sizes. In addition to this size, it comes in a 4.2 oz size, as well as a 6 oz size in the Crest Pro-Health Collection Kit, which as yet to be released."
5.00,"This made my teeth feel like I just had my teeth cleaned at the dentist!"
4.00,"This product was typical crest, and I mean that in a good way. Good quality, good taste, my mouth felt clean. Although it has health benefits, in our house we are more interested in really fresh breath...so we prefer the Crest Expressions line to this new pro-health product."
4.00,"Made my mouth feel clean and my breath fresh. Great value!"
5.00,"This is a very good toothpaste that contains ingredients for many of the problems we face as we get older. Gingivitis, tartar sensitivity, cavities, plaque, whitening and fresh breath are all problems the toothpaste is made to address. It is good to find one toothpaste that can address all of these items. I like the texture and taste of the toothpaste. It reminded me of the paste the dentist uses to clean my teeth and and I get the same clean feeling after brushing with the Crest Pro-health for Life for people over 50. I also like the fact that like other Crest products this comes in a tube with the wide lid that allows the toothpaste to stand up so it does not take up space on the bathroom counter. All in all a good addition to the Crest line."
5.00,"My teeth feel much cleaner using this toothpaste, I will continue to buy this"
1.00,"Got this as an impulse buy while shopping, not bothering to read the package (should read everything these days). Though it had a nice taste that I liked, during the day my mouth burned and peeled after one brushing with it. There was some sort of mucus/gloppy stuff in my mouth, skin peeling. I finally read the box, and it states it could cause staining on your teeth that is not permanent but can be removed by your dentist. That's weird. Not sure I want a whitening toothpaste that causes staining on my teeth. I noticed that some of the pro-health mouthwashes have also been reported as causing staining on teeth. I'll stick to Listerine. But a bigger concern was the burning and peeling. I looked it up online, and realized I had a reaction to it as many others have reported.I did not try it again because it would be foolish to continue using it when something was clearly wrong. I went back to my regular toothpaste and my mouth is okay. I wish I'd read the box in the store as well as the reviews online before purchasing it. My brother wanted to try it, and so far he has not had any issues. But he agreed it was odd that so many people had reactions to it. He stopped using it because he wasn't happy about the possibility of stained teeth.I think for many people, this is either way too strong or contains an ingredient that we are allergic to---which can't ge good seeing that it happens so often. Also, it is marketed for sensitive teeth. I think they should change that because there seem to be too many reactions, not just some fluke here and there. Research it online and you will see there are more negative experiences than good. Personally I think it is dangerous and will never use it again.If you have allergies, sensitive teeth and gums, or have had reactions to other products, you may want to steer clear of this as it contains something that isn't right. Allergies or not, there is still the potential of getting stained teeth."
5.00,"The taste was great, not to minty. When you sqeezed the tube it didn't go all over the place."
5.00,"Over all it was great it left my teeth feeling clean,and it worked great on the kids."
5.00,"Love the way it made my mouth feel fresh and clean."
4.00,"Very effective and helpful. Ads add up to product effectiveness."
5.00,"I really liked this toothpaste. It leaves my mouth fresh and clean."
4.00,"The toothpaste seems to help keep my teeth white and feeling smooth. I like the flavor and how my teeth feel after brushing."
5.00,"I love how it cleaned my teeth and it didnt leave a film like some products do.my breath smells great."
4.00,"Crest ProHealth Clinical Strength Mouthwash kept me feeling clean and minty. Having braces doesn't always allow me to feel like my teeth are clean, but this sure did the trick. My dentist recommended something else, a bit more expensive. I'm gonna go right back and recommend this product to him because I think it's worth it. And I think you should go out and get some too."
5.00,"Squeaky clean teeth that gave me confidence and made me feel like I had a fresh mouth all morning."
5.00,"This is one of the best toothpaste products I have tried."
5.00,"I love this toothpaste. I have very sensitive teeth and this toothpaste. Works great for me. It gives me the fresh clean feeling without the pain."
4.00,"This mouthwash does freshen your breath, yet I didn't get a strong mint aftertaste when using it, which I prefer. The mouthwash is clear in color. Only time will tell if it really whitens my teeth. If it does, then that will be a real selling point for me to purchase again."
5.00,"This toothpaste has a strong, a bit sweet flavor. I like this one- it really refreshens my breath and keeps the clean feeling for long. I used the Crest Scoop Whitening and the taste wasn't as good. The paste is gritty. I didn't experience any peeling in my mouth too."
5.00,"My mouth has never felt so clean. I love this line."
5.00,"I really like this toothpaste. It really DOES leave your teeth feeling clean and plaque free. The only thing I am missing whitening. I would prefer it was a whitening toothpaste also."
4.00,"I love this tasty toothpaste. Makes my mouth feel great."
4.00,"I really liked this rinse. It left my teeth feeling clean and brighter and my breath fresh. I would recommend it to friends and family."
5.00,"I love & trust this product. I think it is a great addition to my dental routine."
4.00,"After using this toothpaste, my teeth felt very clean and looked whiter."
4.00,"Liked the product, clean feeling, would recommend."
4.00,"I loved the way it left my mouth feeling Fresh and clean will most likely buy this again."
5.00,"remove plaques so well. I also use the mouth wash pro health clinical at night. I don't have tooth ache anymore. My plaques easily removed without brushing too close to gum anymore."
5.00,"I would buy this toothpaste. My teeth felt clean and i liked the taste."
3.00,"I liked that i got a clean feeling and fresh breath after use. my only complaint is snap top if not closed right it leaks."
4.00,"Makes my teeth feeling clean. When I'm brushing my teeth it feel like I'm at the dentists"
5.00,"Made my mouth feel super clean and the fresh breath feeling lasted a really long time!"
4.00,"I really like this toothpaste. Overall, I'm a big fan of Crest vs other brands & I definitely like this kind too. My only complaint is the cap- I do not like this style of cap, I prefer the original twist off caps."
1.00,"Please stop selling this product! As the other reviewers said, it affects your taste buds and leaves you with a numbness and metallic taste in your mouth. I can barely taste the food I eat and coffee (a must for me in the mornings)tastes disgusting since I started using this rinse. DO NOT BUY! And please recall/discontinue this product."
5.00,"I really like the Crest Pro-Health toothpaste. I think the health benefits it offers for your teeth and mouth are great, and it seems to do what it says it will. It also still has a great refreshing taste to leave your mouth and breath feeling fresh!"
5.00,"I got the toothpaste and started using it and have been impressed. It works well. It seems to get my teeth super clean and my mouth has that fresh feeling for hours after brushing. I'd definitely recommend it!"
1.00,"The consistency of the toothpaste is more of a runny gel than a paste. If you don't close the cap all the way, it will leak out. Leaves an odd chemical aftertaste."
5.00,"My summary says it all. My teeth felt really clean! I really looked forward to using this product."
4.00,"Love the product. Made my teeth feel extra clean and fresh."
2.00,"Felt very clean, as if I just got back from the dentist!"
5.00,"I tried this and all I can say \"wow\". It cleans your mouth like no other toothpaste. The flavor is not bad either."
4.00,"I liked this toothpaste. My mouth and teeth felt clean afterwards. I would by this again."
4.00,"I have always been a fan of the Crest brand for oral health in my home and this product was just as I expected. I didn't feel it was any better than some of the other Crest products I've tried, but I like it."
4.00,"The product worked well but when I went to buy it in the store it was too expensive."
4.00,"This crest toothpaste was minty fresh and gave my teeth a good clean, shiny feeling."
4.00,"Great clean feeling and good price for the value! I would recommend it to others for sure."
5.00,"I absolutely love this toothpaste. I've used several others from different brands but none get my teeth quite as white as this type does. I have not had any reactions after a year of use. It does make my mouth a little dry, as most toothpastes do, but I drink a little water afterwards and it goes away. Great toothpaste!"
3.00,"This toothpaste has a very subtle gritty texture to it. It does something funny to my tongue and it isn't overwhelmingly refreshing like the other Crest FreshMint toothpastes I've used in the past. I'm a Crest lover, but I won't buy this again as my teeth never have that super clean feeling after using this."
4.00,"My teeth felt super clean after using the toothpaste. The taste was good and it wasn't harsh or gritty. I love it!"
1.00,"This product gave me tongue ulcers. I actually thought I had a throat infection. After a trip to my doctor and a week of antibiotics (which did nothing) I called my doctor for a different antibiotic. He said if it were bacterial I would be getting better with the current antibiotic. My glands were size of golf balls. Not viral, not bacterial must be environmental. The only thing I had been doing differently was the mouthwash, which I discontinued. I am on the mend and recommending everyone to stay away from this product."
5.00,"I have been struggling with plaque buildup for a while now. I was pleased to receive a toothpaste that deals specifically with this issue. The toothpaste taste great and so far seems to be working very well. Thanks for letting me try this product."
5.00,"This stuff doesn't break or hurt my gums. I am definetly switching brands!"
5.00,"I loved this! My mouth felt so fresh and so much cleaner! I actually got some for my daughters to try! They love it too!"
5.00,"Really enjoyed this product! I am very concerned with the health and appearance of my teeth. I love healthy and naturally white teeth and this great paste helps me maintain that ! Will continue to us it and recommend to my friends and family and the person next to me in the toothpaste isle!"
1.00,"I used it a total of three times, stopped four days ago, and still lack a full range of taste in my mouth. In other words, if you use this, you run the risk of depriving yourself of one of life's great pleasures: tasting food and drink. I STRONGLY recommend against using this terrible product. The comments here and otherwise confirm to me that I'm not crazy; this stuff doesn't affect everyone but for those it does, it's TERRIBLE."
4.00,"I really like this product as far as it making my teeth feel clean long after I visit the dentist. However, the only drawback is the taste. I prefer other mouthwashes over this one."
5.00,"I need to use this to keep my gums healthy, it's the only thing that has ever worked for me, and if you also use the mouthwash with it, they seem to be a miracle worker. For the people with the complaints regarding how strong it is and it's affects.....I mean, what did you expect from a clinical grade toothpaste?"
4.00,"You don't have to worry about the burn of alcohol and it also leaves your mouth feeling fresh and clean."
5.00,"I have used Crest for many years, they are simply the best in my opinion. My teeth feel clean, and I have fewer dental problems. I would and do recommend it when I talk to friends."
5.00,"I love the new toothpaste! it does a great job in cleaning my teeth."
5.00,"I am liking this toothpaste very much. My mouth feels clean after using it."
5.00,"This crest Toothpaste is great! Left my teeth feeling clean and fresh!"
4.00,"Claims to address many tooth and gum issues in one toothpaste. Does feel extremely clean after use. Did find it very liquid while brushing and had to spit frequently. Minty taste that doesn't burn or catch your breath. I gave four stars instead of five because it leaves my mouth very dry. And those of us who have to deal with dry mouth issues this is important. Otherwise it's a great toothpaste and I did note a slight lightening in shade of teeth."
5.00,"It is a fantastic product! It makes your mouth feel clean and fresh!"
5.00,"This toothbrush worked great, actually able to get to my back teeth which is normally and struggle for me. Toothpast and mouthwash was great also."
5.00,"Crest Pro-health toothpaste is a must buy for our family. However, the flip top lid will not close after just a few uses so approximately 2/3 of the 7.8 oz. tube is wasted. This type of ineffective lid makes the cost of the product prohibitive."
4.00,"Great product, definitely leaves your teeth feeling \"Dentist clean\"!!"
5.00,"This toothpaste worked great on my teeth. Most of the time clinical toothpaste has a horrible flavor, but this toothpaste was very fresh and minty. I loved this product and I will be buying more of it."
1.00,"I purchased this toothpaste because I had a coupon for it, in a three pack, from a bulk store where I shop. About a week after using it, I noticed that my mouth felt odd after brushing... My mouth felt slimy. Not unclean dirty-slimy... but slippery slimy. My throat would feel almost clogged as well. Then I realized what was happening: The insides of my cheeks and lips were peeling off! My throat felt clogged because there were clumps of mouth skin collecting on the back of my tongue. I was 21 weeks pregnant at the time, so I was worried it was thrush brought on by pregnancy, but no, my doctors tested me for that and I was yeast free. I happened to Google search the peeling mouth problem, combined with extreme sensitivity and sore gums that I was also experiencing and came across HUNDREDS of complaints about this toothpaste. I went to my dentist to confirm this, and she told me to STOP using this toothpaste IMMEDIATELY, and that she had seen many patients who were experiencing problems with this product. I went right out and bought a different tube (different brand and everything, no way I am trusting Crest any longer) and my mouth STOPPED PEELING the very next DAY. I was relieved of my gum pain and my tooth sensitivity in almost three days. I have never in my 27 years of life in America had such an experience with a product that is expressly made to go INTO your mouth!"
5.00,"Leaves your mouth feeling clean & fresh, no medicine after taste. I would buy this product again."
4.00,"I liked the taste and texture of the toothpaste. I am still using it, so I'll find out at my next cleaning how well it works! It did make my teeth feel very nice and smooth!"
1.00,"Burned tongue and it turns out I'm not alone!  Washes with alcohol made my tongue go numb, so I decided to give an alcohol-free version a try and it's even worse!!  It feels like I scalded my tongue, I have no taste. My tongue is super sensitive now. I don't want anything to touch it, food included.  My husband has had no problems, but I'm officially done with commercial mouthwashes, perhaps I'll swish with some salt-water."
5.00,"I am stunned that this product has gotten such terrible reviews. From someone who has struggled with poor oral health, and as a result, gum disease, the Crest Pro Health toothpaste and mouthwash has done wonders for my gums and in such a short period of time. I've only been using it for about two weeks.I am terrified of dentists, and as a result go only when I need to (usually when I have a toothache which results in a root canal). The last time I went I had to have scaling done. Over the last couple of years I have noticed that my gums were bleeding more than they usually do, which is from neglect. I never floss and up until a year ago, I only brushed once a day. I didn't want to have the scaling done again, so after I confided in my future mother in law in my gum problems, she gave me an extra tube of Crest Pro Health, which she raved about. I have been using it for a couple of weeks now, along with the Crest Pro Health mouthwash, and have seen a complete transformation of the health of my gums. They are pinker, bleeding less and over all feel healthier.In regards to the bad reviews. I am sure most products cause side effects (sometimes awful ones) for some. The only way you will know if this will work for you and the health of your gums is to try it out. You will know immediately if it is the right product for you. I have not experienced any irritation to the skin in my mouth or any of the other problems mentioned in the other reviews. My mother and father in law use this and they have not had any problems either.Please know that I am not a dentist, dental hygenist, etc. Also, I have now learned that this product alone with not help. Brush at least twice a day, floss twice a day, use this product and the mouthwash Crest Pro Health puts out and hopefully you will see the same results I have. Good luck!"
5.00,"My teeth feel wonderful! I love Crest! There is always a product to fit your needs and likes."
4.00,"Loved how tne toothpaste made my teeth feel and look clean."
5.00,"This toothpaste left my teeth feeling super clean and my mouth very fresh. The tiny granules are what I love best. It made me feel like my teeth were getting the best possible clean."
5.00,"Definitely recommend this to those who dont like the burn from Listerine. Fresh breath with out the burn and with out the alcohol that can dry out your mouth and make you breath worse"
5.00,"If you don't have gingivitis, or other gum related problems, I don't see a reason to purchase this toothpaste. I'm not sure why so many people are knocking this for tasting bad, causing mucus-like film buildup, or other unpleasant side-effects while also stating they have a healthy mouth! This is strong stuff and shouldn't be used for individuals that have normal to good teeth & gums. Sure, Crest hasn't done a great job informing the consumer that it's not really for the average user, but the \"Clinical\" label should be at least be a warning.This should be viewed like prescription grade dandruff shampoo. You wouldn't use strong dandruff shampoo if you have a healthy scalp/hair (it turns your hair to straw), so why use this if you have healthy gums & teeth?Regarding my experience with the toothpaste, I've never had a cavity or any serious issues concerning my gums, but laziness in my brushing over the last few years has caused two of my teeth to constantly bleed while I brush with my electric toothbrush. I attributed this to plaque buildup along the gum line, which can be particularly challenging to remove with even the best electric toothbrushes. I put extra effort into removing gum-line plaque for all my teeth, and especially the affected teeth, but could not stop the bleeding/soreness while brushing those particular two teeth.Before visiting my dentist, I thought I'd give this paste a try. These first few times I used it I wanted to vomit. Yes, it tastes pretty bad - especially if you're used to regular toothpaste. However, I did get used to the taste after a while and now it doesn't even bother me. Yes, it causes a film like buildup that looks like a slimy booger when you remove it, however, after about a week of use I no longer experience this. If this is really bothering you, I recommend reducing the amount you spread on your brush.Moreover, this toothpaste has done remarkably well in reducing the bleeding and soreness on those two teeth. I can now properly clean each inflicted teeth with my electric toothbrush without any pain or blood. I had some light staining around the gum line on my teeth, and I'm pleased to see that the stains are fading quite significantly. Overall, my mouth and teeth feel far better now having used the Crest Pro-Health than before.This is my routine that helped improve my oral care significantly:- After breakfast: Electric brush with regular toothpaste, floss, and then followed by alcohol-free mouthwash- After Lunch or Mid-Afternoon (at-work): Light-brush with a soft-bristled manual toothbrush and regular toothpaste. This helps prevent the buildup of plaque, especially important if you drink/eat a lot of sugary items- Before Bed - Electric Toothbrush with Crest Pro-Health after flossing. I did not use mouthwash and never rinsed my mouth with water after the initial \"spit\". I figured it was better to keep as much of the toothpaste around the gums/teeth rather than rinsing it out. This took some practice as the bad taste makes it difficult to resist the urge to rinse it out, but I believe this has helped speed up the improvement process.Overall, I've been pleasantly surprised. I hope I can shed some light on helping improve gum problems, but speaking with your dentist is always best. Good luck!"
4.00,"Impressed, my teeth feel great. The flavor wasn't my favorite though but otherwise works great."
4.00,"If you're looking, for whatever reason, for a mouthwash without alcohol, this is the first one we tried and the best one we've found. Clean check-ups have kept on coming after we switched, and we've grown so used to the lack of what we thought of as a \"medicine-y aftertaste\" that I don't think we could go back if we had to. It's a little expensive, but so's everything. And who wants fake teeth or bad breath?"
4.00,"My children were not crazy about it. However, I do enjoy the nice clean feeling it left for MY teeth. It really felt almost like I had just gotten home from the dentist."
2.00,"I liked the way my mouth felt VERY fresh after using. The foaming action promised great things, but I didn't feel any difference on my teeth. I didn't feel as if I just walked from a dental hygienist's appointment. Based on this, I thought the price was high for the results. I could get the same results from the competitor's mouthwash."
5.00,"I have no complaints about the new Crest Rinse that I tried. It's giving me fresh breath throughout the day. Keeping food and drinks from clinging to my teeth. Makes me feel more confident that my teeth and mouth are better protected."
4.00,"These are really quality products. They work nicely together and are easy to find everywhere."
5.00,"Crest is my all time favorite toothpaste. I will stray from Crest at times, but always go back. In my mind Crest is the best tasting along with the fact my kids and myself never have cavities!!"
5.00,"We were looking for a new mouth wash, and this one caught our eye. We read over the bottle and decided it was the one for us. My children (ages 14-20) love this mouth wash. My son told me not to buy any other kind, to stick with this cause it works. Our teeth feel very clean, and seem to be getting whiter. I notice how fresh my mouth feels all day. Our dentist was happy to hear we were using this brand. Thank you for such a great product!"
5.00,"I struggle with dry mouth and oral problems caused by it and the disease I have (scleroderma) and searched for a non-stinging rinse that didn't cost a mint (so to speak.) My mouth was uncomfortable at night and I had truly terrible morning-breath. This product has helped me greatly. Thank goodness for Amazon - I've had no luck finding this in local stores suddenly."
5.00,"This product is really great...Loved how my mouth was really minty & fresh & my teeth also look whiter. I really recommend this product."
4.00,"I enjoyed this product. I did not like the taste of it very well, but it seemed to do what it claims to do."
1.00,"So, now I know why my gum line is receding and why my enamel has been destroyed since using this for several months. I think Crest owes me some dental crowns now and gum grafting. Worst product ever !!!!! Does NOT whiten!!! The only reason you got a star is because I had to give you one to post this warning to consumers."
5.00,"ever since i bought this, it's all my husband wants to use to brush his teeth. our teeth feel really clean and the taste is not overpowering so we're not suffering through a good brushing. thank you for the opportunity!"
4.00,"Over all I think the toothpaste was very good. I would buy this again."
4.00,"Teeth feel clean, but I don't particularly like the taste or the foaming action."
5.00,"I believe that this product can be as effective as advertised after a longer period of use."
5.00,"I love crest products. I will not use any other products other than crest. This product left my teeth feeling like I just left the dentist! Great product!"
1.00,"This is the worst mouth wash ever! After using it my tongue has been numb and my tastebuds seems fried! I cannot taste anything. It hurts to use regular tooth paste. I don't understand how this product is still on the shelf! I should have read the reviews first!"
5.00,"My daughter is the one who used this product. She loves the Crest brand. It is the only brand that I will buy and it is recommended by our dentist. She loves the Crest Pro-Health Clinical. It makes her breath refreshed and her teeth feel nice."
1.00,"This is a total SCAM. They're selling 3 travel sized tubes at regular pricing and it makes it look like you're purchasing 3 large/regular sized tubes. DO NOT PURCHASE! HBC is greedy."
5.00,"I tried the mouthrinse. Fantastic! My teeth feel so clean."
5.00,"I loved these products very much. I think they work well and don't cost too much."
4.00,"Loved the fresh, clean feeling you get after brushing with Crest ProClinical"
5.00,"We all love love love the clean feeling it brings to us."
5.00,"I loved how well the toothpaste left my mouth feeling fresh and my teeth clean. I wasn't sure the changes in the product would be of benefit but they are! I highly recommend this product to others."
5.00,"This was one of the best varities of Crest toothpaste we have tried. I was very happy with it."
5.00,"I have been using Crest for as long as I can remember. This product made my mouth feel very clean and I did like the taste. Keep bringing great products."
4.00,"Excellent product. I have always used Crest products and my dentist recommends them exclusively, so when we were asked to review the toothpaste, we knew we'd be happy. Our breath is always fresh & teeth get thoroughly cleaned. Highly recommend this toothpaste!"
5.00,"We love this toothpaste - it's the one that always leaves our mouth the freshest for the longest amount of time. We were looking for it for a better price than the local supermarkets and pharmacies. I always have that slight fear of buying things like this online in case it's a \"counterfeit\" but sure enough, this pack of 4 was exactly what we were looking for. It's authentic, good price, sealed containers, and not expired dates. As a note about Amazon, it also arrived on-time and well-packed."
5.00,"I have to say, my family and I pretty much love all crest products. I personally just love the fresh clean feeling I get after brushing my teeth. I can tell because it makes my teeth feel so clean and smooth as if I were at the dentist. I love this toothpaste!"
2.00,"Iv been using this product for almost two weeks. It seems to have slowed or stopped my gingivitis as my gums no longer bleed... However, after this period i was forced to stop when my left lower jaw bone gland began to swell and my cheeks started to burn while eating.."
5.00,"I tried the toothpaste and really like it. I have been using Crest toothpaste since I was a little kid (a really long time!). I will continue to use the new toothpaste. Left my teeth feeling really clean."
4.00,"This product was a little more pricey than others on the market but we like it. It makes your mouth feel clean and doesn't burn like so many other washes."
5.00,"This is the only type of \"regular\" toothpaste that doesn't bother my sensitive teeth. Normally I am a user of toothpaste that is specially formulated for sensitive, but this is definitely comparable. I can brush for longer than a week without it bothering my teeth or gums. Great toothpaste."
5.00,"Crest products have always been a favorite in my home but the Pro-Health products exceeded my expectations! Thank you for a fabulous freshness & cleanliness! Thanks again!"
5.00,"left teeth feeling clean and mouth fresh! yes, recommended product"
5.00,"It makes our teeth feel great and has cut down on poor dentist visits. Since using crest prohealth we have had great dental check ups. No cavities...gums are better as well. It really does what they say it should."
5.00,"This product makes your teeth feel great! Just like walking out of the dentist office!"
5.00,"My teeth feel so clean after I brush with this and the taste is great! Another truly great Crest product!"
4.00,"I'm very brand loyal in my toothpaste - Crest all the way - so I'm always both nervous and glad when they release a new product. This one did not disappoint - the ProHealth toothpaste is my favorite, and the new Plaque Control is excellent. My teeth feel so clean!"
5.00,"i like it its make me feel fresh its very good my family also tryed it they like it strong recomend"
4.00,"I, too, have skin slough but I also have that from Listerine pre-rinse mouthwash.  This paste has a mild flavor (\"clean cinnamon\") and a gritty texture.  It does not make my mouth sore and I regard the so called slimy cells as \"dead cells\" that needed to be removed anyway.  I simply brush my gums and inside of my mouth gently or use a washcloth to wipe those cells away.  My recent 6-month dental check-up was better than usual.  I attribute that partly to my gentle Colgate electric toothbrush and to this gritty toothpaste.  There was hardly any tarter to be removed and I have  been using the paste once a day for only two months.  My concern is that the gritty texture may be erosive to the enamel.  I was hoping to find a comment from a dentist concerning this possibility."
4.00,"I love this toothpaste! It makes my mouth feeling unbelievably clean and fresh!"
1.00,"I got this because I was having trouble with receding gums. My teeth were always hurting. After using this I don't have that problem, but did experience damage to my tastebuds. There was also a strange foamy, almost powdery white stuff in my mouth. I was freaked out it might be dissolving some of my fillings! Never did figure out what it was. Between the pain and loss of taste, and the strange white stuff, I am not willing to take a chance by using it again. Don't buy this product. It is a waste of money!"
5.00,"This is a great product. I like the way the toothpaste made my mouth feel clean and fresh. I would reccommend this toothpaste to others."
5.00,"A great toothpaste to buy! It left your teeth feeling clean for a long time. Also, it was refreshing!"
4.00,"I like the flavor of this toothpaste, and I like the way it feels both during and after brushing. It was not too gritty nor overpoweringly- minty. My teeth felt clean for a long time."
4.00,"Great toothpaste! The reason I gave it 4 start instead of 5 is because of the price. I will buy this toothpaste again."
1.00,"Ironically, this mouthwash stains the teeth. See the lawsuit [...] After that, P&G only added a fineprint on the production: \"In some cases, antimicrobial rinses may cause surface staining the teeth.\" And in crest website, [...] they make statements to let people somewhat feel: (1) crest is not alone, every mouthrinse does that; (2) it is consumer's fault; (3) discoloration is actually good sign. What a shame! Our language is really powerful to let people describe snow as black. Amazon, we really should consider to support zero-star reviews."
5.00,"I grew up on Crest and it keeps getting better & better - WTG P&G!"
5.00,"Crest ProHealth Clinical mouthwash is a great product. I especially like this product because it is completely alcohol free! (I've never liked mouthwash products that taste 'mediciney'. The other (and most obvious) benefit of this product, is the fact that it helps you where you might have missed brushing. It is a great product and I recommend it!"
4.00,"This product had a great fresh taste and left my mouth feeling clean and refreshed."
4.00,"The toothpaste is great. It works well, whitens great, and taste good. One problem. The consistency is thinner than most toothpaste, so when it stand on it's lid it oozes out even though the lid is made to stand on end."
5.00,"This is the only toothpaste that I HAVE FOUND that leaves your mouth super minty fresh each night. There are some granules which also help for stain removal, and the mint is not sweet like some toothpastes, but more of a mint burst in your mouth. Recommend brushing every day of course, and I felt as though my teeth were extremely clean after using this."
4.00,"My family tried Crest Pro-Health toothpaste (Clean Mint)and while it offered a decent brushing experience, the flip top cap to the tube leaked and left a mess on our bathroom sink. I think Crest needs to rethink their cap design. Other than that, I liked product and felt that it met our hygiene needs."
4.00,"Loved the way it kept my breath fresh and clean and the way it helps keeps gums healthy."
5.00,"my teeth had that just back from the dentist feel.I will be trying the rest of the products."
4.00,"I have used the toothpaste, and I like the after feeling from clean teeth. while brushing is not my favorite toothpaste flavor, but it sure does the work which is what I care of. Good job Crest."
3.00,"Let me start with what I like about this product. It has a great flavor. It's listed as mint, but I don't know that I really taste the mint. It reminds me of Lavoris (which I haven't seen in a long time), which was a cinnamon-based product. Still, it's mild and doesn't burn up your mouth the way regular Listerine does. You can easily swish it around in your mouth for 30 seconds without burning or pain. Your mouth feels fresh and comfortable after you use it. And I assume (but have no way of knowing) that it helps control plaque. It's a nice product to use after brushing and flossing at night.Now..here's the problem. If you use it at night, you wake up with an unpleasant aftertaste. It leaves a sort-of sour taste in your mouth that doesn't go away with brushing-- and lasts into the morning.So I'll give it three stars for being a better mouthwash experience than other harsh brands, but the aftertaste prevents me from giving it anything higher."
3.00,"I have used mint or citrus Listerine for years because I like the tingly, extra clean feeling it leaves in my mouth. Rather like Altoids, it's curiously strong. I chose this Crest pro-Health mouthwash because it was described as \"invigorating\" which I took to mean it was trying to replicate a similar effect as Listerine, and I thought the flavor might be better. I am not impressed. First, it leaves little green \"bits\" in my teeth and in my sink after rinsing. I'm not sure if the product is not mixed well, but these are a real turn off. Second, the \"fresh mouth\" feeling is very quickly gone. Listerine lasts up to an hour for me. And lastly, it's weak compared to Listerine. I guess invigorating is a relative term.I won't be switching. However, this is stronger than regular Crest or Scope mouthwash, so I think customers looking for something less intense (or less medicine-tasting) than Listerine, but who want something a bit stronger, may like this."
5.00,"Loved this product! Would certainly purchase again. My teeth immediately felt cleaner, smoother and stayed that way for longer than my normal toothpaste. I was blown away with the quality of this product. Thank you."
1.00,"I'm not one to write a negative review unless truly compelled to. I bought Crest Prohealth Alcohol Free, not expecting at all to have any issues with it. I threw away my receipt because why would ever want to try to return it? Well, after just two days of using it my taste buds were altered. I had the \"metal mouth\" many have complained about. I also had tenderness/soreness on the bony ridge above my upper teeth. It hurt so much I had to take some OTC pain relief. I did not at first suspect the mouthwash so I continued using it. On the 4th day I thought about what I had done differently lately and the only thing I could think of was the mouthwash. I stopped using it and after a full day my symptoms went away. It was only then that I found all these other bad reviews. I took it back to the store where I purchased and explained what happened. Despite not having a receipt they thankfully took it back and gave me a refund. Seems like not everyone has this same reaction but I think it' s not worth seeing if you will or not."
5.00,"When I rinse with this mouthwash, my mouth feels and tastes clean all day."
3.00,"I have used Crest my whole life and think this is perhaps a gentle, sensitive variety of toothpaste. It is fresh yet mild, as it doesn't have the burn of some mintier products which some may appreciate. I find that it feels gentle on my gums and does not hurt my sensitive teeth. However it feels quite grainy and I have to rinse pretty well to get that granulated feeling out of my mouth. I am not sure I would repurchase as I prefer something a little more refreshing and less grainy."
1.00,"Six months ago when I first used this product I noticed that the inside of my mouth was peeling. It took me awhile to realize it was the toothpaste. I stopped using it and switched to a different brand. The skin peeling went away.Tonight six months later I decided to use it again as my paste was out and my husband still uses this brand.Immediately I noticed my lips swell and my mouth felt burned. 20 minutes later the lining of skin in my mouth is peeling off.Terrible product. Tossing this out. No one should use something with such hash chemicals."
4.00,"Fresh, clean taste. Really liked this product and will be trying the others: toothpaste and brush"
1.00,"Three days ago, approximately 2 1/2 months after my dental hygienist gave me a free sample of this toothpaste and I continued to use it, I brushed my teeth and felt as if I had just burned the inside of my top lip on a hot pizza. I could feel a raised ridge inside my lip. The burning sensation diminished, but is still there and I now have four blisters in that area. At first, I didn't connect the burning with the toothpaste. However, upon going to the Internet to discover what might have caused this problem, I found that similar reactions had happened to others, and immediately realized it had happened to me as well. On November 12, I called the number listed on the Crest Pro-Health toothpaste tube (which is also the one in the company's comments to other negative reviews). A pleasant customer service representative heard my complaint and referred me to a health professional for the company. I explained the details of my experience which included using other mouthwashes (Listerine, Pro-Health, Hydrogen Peroxide) and concentrating on my front teeth where I need an implant. I explained I was not necessarily seeking health advice, but only wanted to register my concerns. We agreed that perhaps it was the combination of all my efforts regarding the front teeth that produced the response I experienced. Still, I will not use this product again."
4.00,"I've used the pro health line for a while and when I tried the plaque control it met my expectations I have from this brand."
5.00,"Good morning, thought it was a perfect time to write my review as I just brushed my pearly whites with Crest Pro-Health toothpaste. By the way they got pearly white by using the Crest whiting strips which I love,love,love! The toothpaste left my mouth with a clean,fresh taste and the best part is they work their magic to keep my teeth healthy. This is not one of those taste great toothpastes with no health benefits. Then I flossed with the Crest dental floss which was flavored and slid right between my teeth with ease. Followed all this off with some Crest mouthwash and I am ready to face the day. Look out world here I come :)"
1.00,"I purchased this and had a worst feeling after brushing in the morning. It is thick and feels like it has lot of sand. I cannot describe it verbally, but you dont get that Ah feeling after brushing. I thought maybe I am the only am the only one feeling it, till I read other reviews. I do like Crest brands, but this one is not for me."
4.00,"It does help with plaque like it said, fresh clean taste."
5.00,"I really liked this rinse. My mouth felt very clean and it was a comfortable product to swish for the recommended time. I would buy this again."
5.00,"I love how it made my mouth feel after using it! There is nothing better than feeling like you just came from the dentist and how polished and clean it feels to run your tongue over your clean teeth! Great product!"
1.00,"My dentist told me to start using an alcohol free rinse at my cleaning 4 months ago. I didn't like it at first because it left a strange after taste that would make everything I ate taste strange for about 2 hours after rinsing. About one month into use I noticed a weird stain in between two of my teeth. I thought it was plaque and tried pretty hard to remove it with floss but it would not come off. Since then I have had *dark* stains develop in between most of my teeth. I floss, brush, and waterpik daily and have never had this problem before. Stay away from this product at all costs."
5.00,"That's how teeth should feel. Like you just came from the hygienist."
5.00,"The clinical mouthwash was the best I've ever used. Definitely worth the price. My mouth felt absolutely refreshed!"
4.00,"does not burn it is good taste and works try it and see"
5.00,"I enjoyed the mint flavor, and the fact that this paste was plaque control. The whitening factor was also important. I love the Crest brand."
1.00,"I purchased this product and by the end of the second bottle noticed dark stains on my teeth, sort of like a chewing tobacco user. After visiting my dentist today (which I do religiously twice a year and also floss, brush and water pik each day) he ended up scraping off dark brown stains all over my teeth. I'd noticed them recently and couldn't understand where they had come from as nothing in my normal routine had changed. He nailed it with the mouth wash! I will NEVER buy this product again and will not be buying any Crest products because of it. There should be a warning on the bottle indicating the staining problem as my dentist said it is a known problem with this product. It should be taken off the market in my opinion. Also, not all of the staining could be removed unfortunately. I am angry as a result."
3.00,"Another solid Crest toothpaste. Has a nice mellow mint taste. Personally, I can't get enough mint blast when I brush my teeth so this stuff is quite tame for my preference. Except for the toned down mint flavor, I can't tell what makes it for 50+ people. It says it is \"for people over 50 because it has a smoother formulation\". Except for taste, I can't distinguish. It comes with the large flip top cap that all of Crest's \"premium\" toothpastes seem to come with. I don't like these tops. They always break well before we are done with the toothpaste. Although the outside of the cap tends to stay clean a mess often forms inside the cap. Obviously, this doesn't change the effectiveness of the toothpaste. Just the presentation."
4.00,"I really liked this product, but my husband LOVED it!"
4.00,"I usually use Crest Pro-Health Toothpaste and because my husband has sensitivity, we decided to try Crest Pro-Health For Life Smooth Mint Flavor Toothpaste. So far, it works very well for sensitivity and helps fight stains from the coffee I drink every day. If I had a complaint, it would be that if the paste stays on your tongue for too long, it feels slightly numb. Otherwise, I love this toothpaste!"
5.00,"After using this toothpaste, my teeth felt very clean and my breath was very fresh. Great taste."
1.00,"Be very careful if you are going to try this product. I tried it once months ago as a preventative measure, I do not have gingivitis, and my mouth was immediatley peeling and sore to the touch the next day...I stopped using the product right away and have recentky attempted to give it another chance. Once again my mouth was sore just by licking my tongue on my gums and as I brushed my teeth with it. Also peeling again! I'm throwing this toothpaste out and NEVER purchasing it again. Lesson learned! Some may not be as sensitive, but from my own reading it seems many reviews are similar to mine!"
1.00,"This stuff is awful. I'm surprised it hasn't been pulled from the shelves. This stuff makes my tongue feel like it's been burned, like when you drink something that's too hot. I got small cracks and tiny blisters on the tip. Crazy!"
5.00,"Love, love love. I have always used Crest products. When they came out with the Pro-Health line, of course, I had to try it and now they have the clinical line. I love the clean, fresh feeling the clinical Pro-Health gives me and I will continue to use it. By far the best product out there."
5.00,"I really like it;it helps my mouth keep clean all day"
5.00,"I love this toothpaste and the convenience of subscribe and save. Taste great and leaves your teeth nice and clean."
5.00,"I really loved the taste and feel of this toothpaste. I had doubted that it would give me that fresh from the dentist feeling but it really surprised me. It really did do what it said it would do and since Crest is a recommended brand it makes me feel even better about my choice."
3.00,"The good:                                                                     This stuff did leave my mouth feeling very clean over time &amp; my teeth did seem whiter after a week of using. It's true that it doesn't sting because it doesn't contain alcohol, but that brings us to...                                                                     The bad:                                                                     Whatever substitute they use for alcohol has some negative effects. The first time I used it my mouth was completely numb for at least an hour. After using it a few times that was isolated to just my tongue, but it was still really uncomfortable. Also, it left me almost unable to taste salt. For me that's a problem because I love the taste of salt &amp; put it on almost everything. But also we all know the effects of eating too much salt (high blood pressure, etc.) so that wasn't something I'm too keen on giving up. I've used other mouthwashes that work just as well without damaging my taste buds."
5.00,"i swear by crest! this stuff was a hit at my house. left you with fresh breath and taste was pleasant."
5.00,"My mouth felt totally refreshed and my teeth were sparkling after I used this toothpaste! I was really thrilled at how great this worked, and the taste didn't bother me (like a lot of toothpaste usually does)-- it wasn't too strong, but I still had a \"fresh\" feeling."
4.00,"I was always a Crest Kid, and trying the new clinical line was no exception. I felt that the rinse was very fresh, and didn't have that alcohol sting like so many others. I felt clean and fresh long after my cleaning was over. I would use this product again."
5.00,"the toothpaste left my mouth feeling clean and fresh with no fuzzy teeth for hours.ni am a night nurse and this is very important to me. I will always use this product unless crest comes out with a better one"
4.00,"I liked the way my teeth felt afterwards and for several hours. My daughter liked it too. Received a sample and glad I did. I will be getting more on my next shopping trip."
5.00,"Absolutely loved this and our family loves crest toothpaste"
2.00,"This stuff actually burned the tip of my tongue while i was swishing it around in my mouth. I waited 30 minutes (actually an hour) to eat just like the label says. i could not taste my food. I couldn't taste anything. The thing that freaked me out was the fact that it took forever for my taste to come back. I mean i literally had to wait a whole day to taste anything.                                                                     I figured this happened because I hadn't used mouthwash in a long time, so i decided to wait a week and try it again. I kid you not, I am sitting at my desk at work trying to enjoy this delicious spaghetti my husband made, and it is not happening. It was so good before the mouthwash.                                                                     The worst part about it is that it catches you off guard. You really don't expect your food to taste that bad, or not taste anything at all. I feel like my tongue is damaged.                                                                     I think i will go back to buying the off brand mouthwash. At least I could taste my food. And i love to eat."
5.00,"This Crest toothpaste is a good item and it really does seem to help at least somewhat with helping keeping your teeth somewhat white."
1.00,"I've tried both the Crest Prohealth mouthwash and the Prohealth toothpaste.  Both caused brown staining within a couple of days of using.  I had to undergo deep  cleaning at the dentist and it was slightly painful for my sensitive gums.  My dental hygienist told me that some patients had stains as a result of this mouthwash and some did not.  I guess it depends on the person but I'm staying away from this product."
3.00,"Please shoppers...Compare the label on this new \"Clinical\" version with Crest's own \"All-Around Protection\" toothpaste that's been around for years. They ARE IDENTICAL. Same ingredients, same use & warning labels. Identical. I do like using both, and like this new one. This new one may be mintier and leave a stronger & more \"invigorating\" feeling in the mouth. But they are the same. Now if they are priced the same, take your pick. But I suspect this is all just part of marketing in America, and more expensive. BTW.... Are you aware both toothpastes are made in Germany? It may not matter, but it just surprises me. They ship this a long way for consumers here. Again, read the labels. UPDATE 3/2013: As the tube ended I found it more difficult to squeeze the toothpaste out. Does that mean it's thicker, or perhaps the opening hole was cut wrong?"
4.00,"Having now used an entire bottle of Crest Pro-Health Clinical Deep Clean mouthwash I can easily say it's among the best mouthwashes I've tried. Importantly this mouthwash doesn't burn like those brands containing high levels of alcohol. The amount needed for an individual rinse is relatively small thanks in part to the foaming characteristics of this wash. The taste is clean and not overpowering and leaves my breath fresher for a longer period of time. Make no mistake this is a superior brand to the everyday generic and even many of the national brands that I've tried.The one detraction I have for this product and hence the 4-star rating is the price. At about $.25/ounce this is not cheap stuff. The last time I purchased a bottle of Scope I paid right around $.09/ounce. So take that for what it's worth. I do believe the Crest product is better. But for a price conscious consumer it's an important delineation."
5.00,"Very much like the way your teeth feel after brushing w/ Crest. Like the product."
5.00,"always love crest rinse more than other brands b/c the product makes my mouth feel clean, refresh but not harsh."
4.00,"I like the packaging and feel of the product. Only time will tell if it does as promised in reguards to plaque."
4.00,"love the swifter is easy to use and does a great job"
5.00,"My teeth and gums feel and look great after using this toothpaste. I really feel like I am doing something good for my body using this product."
5.00,"Loved this toothpaste! Left mouth feeling minty fresh."
5.00,"My mouth feels great after brushing. Love It!Feels good to be taking such great care of my teeth."
4.00,"I'm not picky at all when it comes to toothpastes, this one was not my favorite but still good"
5.00,"This was my first time to use Crest Pro Health Rinse. I was pleasantly surprised by the minty long lasting taste. I will definitely be promoting this product in the future."
5.00,"After using the Crest Pro-Health toothpaste my mouth felt clean and refreshed and continued to stay that way right up until the next time I brushed."
5.00,"Wonderful product, the only toothpaste my husband requests."
5.00,"I just got back from having my teeth cleaned after using the crest pro-health toothpaste. The technician said I was making her job easy because my teeth looked so great! Thanks Crest!"
1.00,"This stained my teeth horribly. Avoid it like the plague. I used it for a month and then I noticed my bottom teeth were brown with dark brown in between each. This is ridiculous. Google this product and \"brown stains\" or \"staining\". Crest has had hundreds of complaints about this product but still does not remove it from the shelves. FDA won't remove it because it's not life threatening ... stained teeth won't kill you but it will kill you're confidence. Crest needs to do the right thing and remove it. Obviously doing the right thing is not in their dictionary. Because their is complaints on this product going back several years. Very Sad!"
5.00,"I really think this is a great product which works extremely well. The flavor was not overpowering at all. I will definitely be buying a full sized version."
5.00,"It didn't burn my mouth which is often a problem for me as I have very sensitive gums. I also liked the bottle."
5.00,"The mouth rinse worked really well and left my breath and mouth feeling clean and fresh."
5.00,"I love the taste, I love the \"grit\", I love the mouth feel. The best toothpase out there for people who love cinnamon. One minor drawback, it's very thick and a bit hard to squeeze out of the tube."
4.00,"I must say, my whole mouth felt very, very clean and I LOVED the taste. It was a surprising difference from my regular brand and it helps keep my teeth white. I'm very excited to try the toothpaste as well."
5.00,"This mouthwash was awesome. It didnt sting my mouth like other mouthwashes do, and my mouth really felt clean after using it."
5.00,"This mouthwash keeps the mouth fresh much longer than using regular mouthwash. Also there are a lot other health benefits as well."
4.00,"my mouth feeling clean and no smell bad breath. Reduce plaque and gingivitis"
5.00,"I feel that overall we received a good value for our money with the Crest and Oral B ProHealth products. I feel that it did a great job cleaning our teeth and even the flossing. We, as a family recommend this to our other \"internet family\""
4.00,"If you have problems with gingivitis or tooth sensitivity, Crest's Pro-Health line might be worth a try. The Pro-Health products use stannous fluoride instead of the more common (and cheaper) sodium fluoride, and from what I've read, there are some studies that indicate that stannous flouride may be more effective on gingivitis or sensitive teeth. On the other hand, if you DON'T have any special needs, this may not be worth the extra expense. What's more, some people report tooth staining with stannous fluoride products, so I wouldn't recommend this to people who didn't have a good reason to use it. How does it differ from other toothpastes in the Pro-Health line? Well, in my opinion, it has a milder mint flavor, which is pleasant but not the face full of mint I've come to expect from toothpaste. (Which is odd, because some of the other reviewers find the taste unusually strong). It also is advertised as providing \"clinical gum protection,\" but I am not sure how it differs from any other product with the same active ingredient. Still, I like the flavor, and I would recommend that people with particular gingivitis or sensitivity concerns give this toothpaste a try."
5.00,"I love this mouthwash. It is the absolute best I have ever used. It leaves your mouth feeling clean and refreshed. I trust nothing else but the crest brand when it comes to caring for my family's oral health."
5.00,"I have always enjoyed using Crest toothpaste. My teeth feel clean after each use. My mouth feels refreshed after using the Crest Pro-Health Toothpaste. I have noticed a slight change in teeth color."
5.00,"I have never had a mouthwash that keeps your breath fresh overnight and into the next day. This one works and im going to continue to use it!"
5.00,"We're regular users of Crest products, so I expected nothing but a good experience from this one & am not at all disappointed. I have sensitive teeth & need a toothpaste that's effective & keeps my teeth from hurting & this one fits the bill."
4.00,"I liked this mouthwash mainly because it didn't taste like medicine! And it didn't burn my mouth either. It's a little more expensive than other brands, but it does taste good and keeps my mouth feeling very fresh and good after I use it."
5.00,"I really like the taste of this rinse. My mouth felt fresh all day"
5.00,"Like the added benefit of tartar control."
4.00,"It did a good job! Lived up to brand expectations."
4.00,"I received this product to try and tell and it was better than I expected. I love that it didn't leave behind a nasty taste in your mouth or film on your teeth. It actually makes your teeth feel clean and your breath taste fresh. It also helps with the sensitivity to cold food and drinks, which is a big plus! I would recommend this any day!"
1.00,"Unfortunately it took me a few days to figure out it was this product creating the horrible burning on my tongue. I couldn't taste food and my tongue burned constantly. Tried to leave a review on the Crest clinical website and (shockingly) the review submission for this product is not working. Can't believe its on shelves. Terrible. Awful. Do not use unless you like the sensation of your tongue being on fire."
4.00,"I thought it was a little on the pricier side, but maybe that was just the drug store I purchased I at. Overall my mouth felt quite clean after using it. Would recommend."
5.00,"This has to be the best toothpaste I've ever tried. My mouth felt fresh for hours. It's a little more than I would normally spend for toothpaste, but my husband and I both agreed it was worth the extra cost."
1.00,"After only 2 uses I have a swollen parotid (saliva) gland on going to urgent care as soon as it opens. Come to find out there is a whole forum on the subject. They need to take this off the shelves!!!"
1.00,"I do not drink coffee, tea, soft drinks or wine. The staining occurred not long after I started using this product. I tried some Crest Whitestrips - the 2-hr, 7 strip box - not even they got rid of the stains! After having my teeth cleaned by my dentist, I see much improvement, but he was unfortunately unable to get rid of the staining between some of my bottom teeth (I assume due to a fixed retainer I have on the back of those teeth - limits access to the stained area).                                                                     NEVER buying another Crest mouthwash!"
1.00,"I floss and use soft picks daily and very rarely have issues with soreness or bleeding, but after three uses of this mouthwash, my gums became visibly swollen and so tender that flossing was very painful and resulted in a fair amount of bleeding, to the point where I had to stop flossing. After more than 48 hours the symptoms have not decreased at all. I haven't had the brown stains or numbness/burning mentioned in other reviews, but this was bad enough. I rarely have allergic reactions to anything and have never had issues with dental hygiene products before. Even if Crest won't pull the product, the warnings on the package need to be expanded significantly. Maybe you won't be one of the people who has a bad reaction, but why take the chance? There are plenty of other mouthwashes out there."
1.00,"It took me some trial and error to realize this toothpaste was what was making my skin slough off and my mouth so raw. But the side effect of that is also being more sensitive to hot food. Normally I am not someone who burns my mouth on hot foods, as I will wait for them to cool enough. After switching to this toothpaste, I burned myself twice. The second time was bad enough to send me to the dentist so we could figure out what was going on with my mouth. I went back to my old brand, and things improved pretty quick."
5.00,"Love Crest products! I have used them all my life."
5.00,"You really do get that \"after the dentist\" clean feel, but without the gritty after taste. I get a slight tingly feel around my gum line while brushing, and after, that tells me it's working, but it's nothing like the extreme sensation you get from brands like Listerine. I love this stuff, and I'm switching toothpastes to it!"
4.00,"I love all of the Crest products. Crest Pro-Health covers all issues you may have with your teeth. I like that it is not too minty and overwhelming. I would recommend Crest products to everyone."
5.00,"great feeling of clean, it was definitely worth using again. loved it"
4.00,"This toothpaste left my teeth feeling really clean. The only drawback was the aftertaste. I would recommend this to anyone who wants a just-came-from-the dentist feel!"
3.00,"Loved the taste and aftertaste - how clean the mouth feels after"
5.00,"I totally love this toothpaste! It makes my mouth feel squeaky clean!"
5.00,"I used the clinical plaque control. It's a paste with a gritty texture not unlike what they use at the dentist's office. It has the same great taste as the other pro-health toothpaste, but, my teeth felt a lot cleaner when I brushed them. I will be purchasing this product from now on."
4.00,"I love the Crest clinical protection mouth rinse. Not only does my mouth feel fresh, but that feeling lasts for hours. I also know that this is adding an extra layer of protection to my teeth and who doesn't love that?"
5.00,"The Oral-B and Crest products work great and make you mouth feel really clean."
1.00,"After using the whitening version of this product for two weeks by cheeks and inside of lower lip became red and rough. The next day white \"canker sore\" eruptions occurred throughout my mouth. I have never had more than one canker sore in my mouth at a time in my life. My dentist said it could have been an a reaction to a new toothpaste, and bingo, I knew it was this stuff. HORRIBLE! I haven't been able to eat anything more than vanilla ice cream, milk, and white bread for 4 days now. The pain is horrible and unrelenting. No over the counter remedies are helping, and I've purchased them all. Similar reports are all over the internet. Be careful!!!!"
1.00,"I have used this product for one week. Since the first use I noticed the metallic taste and change in taste buds. Three days ago a the side effects changed to include burning, and uncomfortable dryness of my gums, numbness and irritation of my tongue, and slight discoloration of my teeth--though I just had a cleaning. I realize now, after reading the reviews on these \"PRO-HEalth\" products, that this mouthwash is causing all my problems. Read the reviews --many people are having a bad experience with this product I wish I had read them before I bought it. I poured mine down the sink."
4.00,"I should start by saying that this \"Gum Protection\" toothpaste has the same active ingredient (.454% stannuous fluoride) as other Crest Pro Health toothpaste. I am not sure what makes it particularly good for the gums. With that said, I like the texture of this version, which is very thick and a bit gritty, similar to the fluoride paste used by my dentist. That taste is also strangely similar to that paste, which is a pleasant clinical mint. I prefer the Crest Complete with Scope Outlast, which keeps my breath fresh longer, but this milder mint would be better if I was brushing before a meal. Overall, Crest Pro-Health Gum Protection toothpaste is a good product and one that I enjoy using, but not enough to go out of my way to find."
4.00,"In general this is a good toothpaste, but for me personally I didnt like the way it felt in my mouth so I don't use it anymore. To me it felt too sticky and gloppy...but my husband uses it and really likes it so I guess its just me :)"
5.00,"I can't say anything negative about this product, did what it was supposed to do."
5.00,"this product was great it left my teeth cleaner and brighter will continue to buy crest so glad I tried it"
5.00,"My dentist gave me a sample of this toothpaste and I just had to have after trying. I could not find the night version in local stores so I went to AMazon to purchase. It keeps my teeth from plaque buildup. When I floss if there is any there it lifts it out as if there was a shield over my tooth that won't let it stick. Even if there is some that I left by mistake from a previous floss and it looks as if it is solid and stuck it comes out as one piece. The dental hygenist has said in the past that due to my medications my mouth is dry and that makes it harder to keep plaque from forming. I was interested that another person with dry mouth wrote that this helps his mouth too. I Love this toothpaste. As I went down the toothpaste aisle at Walmart recently a lady was looking at all the Crest Pro Health choices, I told her the one I liked best wasn't there and she said she was looking for the one especially for gums since her daughter loved it. So I guess this Pro Health toothpaste, no matter what type is pleasing everyone who tries it. As a disclaimer, I do floss once a day."
3.00,"didnt like the bad taste in my mouth however it did clean well and do its job"
4.00,"This made my whole mouth feel cleaner and stay cleaner longer"
5.00,"Above all others, this has been my favorite and primary toothpaste for years. Cleans teeth and mouth well, leaves mouth feeling fresh with just a little bite of cinnamon after taste, tubes are 'stand up' versions, and Crest's Pro Health paste cinnamon tastes much much better than any cinnamon gel (or other pastes for that matter) I have purchased. All other cinnamon toothpastes either don't taste right or are overpowering. To my knowledge, this Crest product is no longer available in retail stores. A little more expensive than other brands but in my opinion it is worth it and convenient to buy in 4-packs."
4.00,"I love this product! It left my teeth feeling very clean and smooth. Even when I woke up my mouth still felt fresh."
5.00,"makes your mouth feel very fresh without being overpowering. Just a nice clean fresh feeling from a brand I trust."
4.00,"Well, this toothpaste tastes nice and is recommended by some dentists. As for all its claims, the only active ingredient is fluoride, so, good, but nothing trail-blazing. Plus, the cost is on the high side. I do like the flip-open top......seems more convenient than normal screw tops, however I did see one review where the top broke easily and it does look like it could break rather easily, so best for a buyer to weigh that feature for themselves. So, overall it is fine and if someone does feel a special need for one of its features, I think it is worth trying, especially since Crest is a quality name."
5.00,"We have used the tooth paste and mouthwash.It is excellent,leaves our teeth feeling as good as the dentist. This is the only product we will use now,GREAT."
4.00,"I liked the way your mouth felt after brushing and even hours later. I didnt like the foamy feeling... it just felt like it foamed up too much."
4.00,"I find it similiar to other Crest toothpastes I have used in the past. However, I always like Crest brand!"
5.00,"Crispy clean!! Love it. And no dry mouth afterwards"
4.00,"I really enjoyed this product. I liked how the flavor wasn't too strong yet it still did it's job. I also noticed my teeth were a few shades whiter in a few weeks."
5.00,"My wife and I enjoy this toothpaste because it works and it is cinnamon flavored. I get tired of mint flavored toothpastes."
5.00,"The Clinical mouth rinse left my mouth feeling fresh and clean for a good long time. My smile looks brighter too."
5.00,"Really liked it. Felt like I had just been to the dentist. Teeth felt really clean."
5.00,"My family and I really liked this toothpaste and would recommend it."
5.00,"Had a great fresh taste and it made my whole mouth feel clean. Would definitely recommend this product."
4.00,"This rinse by Crest left my mouth feeling cleaner and my breath fresher. Will purchase again. My whole family agreed that it's a product all can use. I plan on using other items from the product family to see if, in combination with the rinse, my teeth appear more white."
5.00,"highly recommend!this toothpaste really works. just went to dentist after 7 months and hardly had any plaque at all."
5.00,"i loved how clean it made my mouth feel it is a great line of products"
5.00,"love the way it made my teeth feel and really makes my breath smell good"
4.00,"I tried Crest Pro Health and again was blown away by the quality of Crest products. I love the flavor and the extra clean feeling of my teeth and gums! I would recommend this product definately!"
4.00,"Teeth feels clean and fresh. Also your breath is so fresh. Great taste and you know all this has to be good for your mouth."
1.00,"Wow. I have had braces for about two years and I'm about to get them off. I've been using crest pro health and I pit a flashlight on my teeth to see the progress. Keep in mind I brush my teeth 3x a day a floss my whole set 2x a day... I want clean teeth. Anyway I put a flashlight on my teeth and brown like codes stains were surrounding the bracket s. After 2 years of preparation to have straight and white teeth, I have brown stains in between and surrounding the bracket."
5.00,"Even my dentist highly recommends this products, works well, no aftertaster (In my opinion) and also as a bonus cleans my nightguard too - I never used Listerine or any other product, but I'm very happy with this one for sure."
4.00,"Compared to other mouthwashes I have used this one left your mouth feeling refreshed all day long loved it!!"
5.00,"I was so happy with how clean the pro health clinical toothpaste made my teeth feel! This is a great line of products."
5.00,"This product has a great taste and dosn't burn, it leaves your mouth feeling fresh and clean and no harsh aftertaste!"
5.00,"enjoyed this product. If your teeth are sensitive, this toothpaste is mild enough not to irritate your teeth. Refreshing mint flavor. Specially formulated for older adults. I will buy this product again."
5.00,"I love how this toothpaste has the capacity to really get my teeth clean, and also leaves me feeling like my mouth is totally fresh!"
2.00,"I've been using this toothpaste for a couple days now and I actually like the flavor and how it cleans but after reading through the negative reviews I'm too scared to continue using this product. Even if after weeks of usage I didn't experience any of the problems that other reviewers have I could never recommend this product to someone knowing that there are that many people out there that have had such serious problems with this product. There are so many more options out there why put yourself at risk? My recommendation is to try something that's rated much better than this product."
4.00,"I believe this product does what it claims, but the taste need work."
5.00,"I always use Crest, but I really like this new Crest Pro-Health Clinical toothpaste. It leaves my teeth feeling very clean. I highly recommend it!"
4.00,"Loved the way this made my mouth feel-fresh and clean"
5.00,"This toothpaste seems to clean our teeth better than other brands. My only wish is that they would make it in cinnamon."
5.00,"I really liked the way the toothpaste tasted and made my teeth feel. They seemed to be about one shade brighter as well. I would recommend this product to anyone."
5.00,"I thought this was a great product. It worked very well and I really like the Crest Brand. All of their products are good. I have already purchased more of it."
3.00,"I bought this toothpaste because it was a good deal for a two pack. The first time I tried it, and several times after that, the toothpaste left a strange feeling in my mouth. It leaves the bottom of my mouth, underneath my tongue, super dry. The toothpaste reminds me of the old school kind I used as a kid, it has that chalky/sandy feeling to it. Definitely a PASTE and not a gel toothpaste that many of us are used to seeing. I think that might have something to do with this strange reaction. Other than that, the toothpaste works just fine. It freshens my breath and leaves my mouth feeling clean. I probably won't buy it again because of the drying thing, but it's not so unpleasant that I'm not going to finish using it."
4.00,"My mouth felt clean, maybe a little too much as it left a squeaky feeling to my mouth, and it tastes great. Not overpowering like so many mouthwashes."
5.00,"I used to buy this years ago and for some reason I can't find it locally anymore. This stuff is great and my mouth feels so much fresher in the mornings when I use this before sleeping."
5.00,"My teeth felt very clean after using this! I thought it was a good quality mouthwash."
5.00,"Ever since I began using mouthwash on a daily basis nearly five years ago, I stopped getting painful chancre sores on the insides of my mouth. I would have to rinse with hydrogen peroxide until they healed and disappeared. I have used a variety of mouthwashes. The ones with alcohol burn my mouth. There is some speculation that using mouthwash with alcohol may contribute to gum cancer but several dentists whom I have spoken with said this isn't true. Nevertheless, the mouthwashes with alcohol do burn and irritate my mouth. Several years ago, I began using Crest 3D White Multi-Care Whitening Rinse Glamorous White, Fresh Mint [Crest 3d White Multi-Care Whitening Rinse Glamorous White - Fresh Mint 473 Ml (Pack of 12)]. It doesn't have alcohol but it does have a tremendous amount of peroxide that is reputed to whiten one's teeth. I do think using the Crest 3D, along with my Philips Sonicare electric toothbrush (Philips Sonicare Essence HX5350/02 Power Toothbrush), helped decrease the number of cavities I've been having. However, the peroxide taste is very annoying to say the least. I believe the main reason I bought the Crest 3D was because the mouthwash is clear and wouldn't stain my vanity's countertop like other mouthwashes have, especially the bright blue ones. That is why I was always hesitant about buying the Crest Pro-Health Rinse. It has a bright blue color. The Amazon Vine Program was gracious enough to mail me a 1 liter bottle of Crest Pro-Health Rinse Complete, Fresh Mint. It doesn't contain alcohol or peroxide. The mint flavoring is pleasant and refreshing. I swish the mouthwash around my mouth for no more than thirty seconds to a minute before spitting out. The Crest Pro-Health doesn't stain my teeth like some mouthwashes have been reported to have done to customers. Also, its cap is easy to remove. I have arthritis in my fingers and have had difficulty removing the child-proof caps from the bottles of other mouthwashes. Also, I keep the Crest Pro-Health inside the bathroom's vanity. I won't let it sit on the marble countertop for fear that the deep blue mouthwash will permanently stain it like others have done. I've been using the Crest Pro-Health for over a week and haven't experienced any allergic reactions. I have not lost my sense of taste like some have reported when using other mouthwashes. Neither has there been any tingling or numbness around my mouth or jaw. I use this product as much as three times a day: once in the morning, once in the afternoon when I get home from work and plan to leave again, and once in the evening. If used only once, it is best to use it in the evening before going to bed. Because of its fluoride content, one shouldn't eat or drink within thirty minutes after using this mouthwash. I highly recommend using the Crest Pro-Health Rinse Complete, Fresh Mint, to anyone who wants to prevent cavities, chancre sores, gum disease, and bad breath. Using mouth wash also kills harmful germs and decreases one's chance of catching a cold or flu. Ever since I began using a mouthwash on a regular basis, I seldom catch a cold or flu. My advice is to buy a mouthwash that you will enjoy USING because, in order for it to work properly, you will need to actually USE it. Make it a part of you daily regiment. I always floss and rinse after brushing. In this way, I never forget. As busy as I am, I don't have time to ask myself if I have already flossed or brushed that day. Joseph B. Hoyos"
5.00,"This product really made me feel like I had just left the dentist after a cleaning"
5.00,"I used this for a week straight and I loved the way my teeth felt after I brushed. I would recommend it to anyone. I used the Sensitive teeth one. But I don't think that really matters.. I so would continue to use."
4.00,"I really liked this toothpaste. It made my mouth feel so clean and my tooth so smooth. I would definately recommend this toothpaste to everyone."
1.00,"For the first time in my life I had bad brown stains on my teeth. I couldn't figure it out because I hadn't changed eating habits. My dental hygienist asked if I had switched mouthwash. When I told her that I had switched to Crest Pro-Health she told me that she had been having similar staining reports from other patients who had been using Crest Pro-Health. I looked online and found many others having the same problem. I quit using it and my staining problem is gone. I don't understand why Crest, which I have trusted for many years, continues to sell this product."
1.00,"I'm pretty sure this is the first review I've written for Amazon.com.  And after all of the products I've purchased and researched through this site, it's hard for me to believe that my first review is of a tube of toothpaste I bought at the local grocery store. Like other posters, I noticed flesh peeling from the inside of my mouth shortly after I started using this product.  After three weeks, the problem hadn't gone away, so I did a little research to confirm my suspicion that the problem was caused by the toothpaste.  I suspect that this product will be pulled from store shelves within six months.  If the rumors of serious side effects requiring medical attention are true, I wouldn't be surprised to see a class action suit."
4.00,"I found that it cleaned really well and left my teeth feeling great but that the feeling didn't last very long. Maybe it is just me, but the taste was great and I loved the feeling right after I rinsed."
5.00,"I used the Crest Pro-Health Clinical Plaque Control for the first time and it made my mouth feel amazing! I will definitely keep using it and so will my family."
5.00,"Really gets teeth clean!!! Love this product......so glad I got to try it."
5.00,"This is now my favorite toothpaste. Cleans really good and leaves my mouth fresh. Plus a great buy."
5.00,"I love this mouthwash. I have always been a fan of Crest products but when I tried this mouthwash over a week span I could tell a big difference in the health of my gums and the whitness of my teeth."
1.00,"After starting to use Crest Pro-health mouthwash, I began to rapidly develop black stains between my teeth, and the base of my teeth was turning brown. I went to the dentist to see if there was an explanation. They asked me if I had been using Crest or Listerine mouthwash recently. It would never have occured to me to make the link between a tooth care product and stained teeth! This stuff is bad news. Fortunately my dentist had seen the problem before and was able to give me the answer I needed. I will be requesting a refund for the product, and reimbursement for the dentist's cleaning bill."
4.00,"Worked well and teeth felt great. Loved the taste."
5.00,"I love this tooth paste. The texture was smooth and the taste was good. It made my teeth feel clean and shiny and made my breath fresh!"
5.00,"I thought I used all of the Crest brands, but I haven't. This Crest Pro-Health is a nice product. I used it this morning with my battery-powered Oral B and was amazed at the flavor. It has a hickory, smoked flavor to it. It's not bad at all but usually I was expecting that blue minty flavor because the gel is blue. After about 3 minutes with the brush on, my teeth feel really clean. In this solution the paste has some micro beads in it. I guess that's for friction. But, it feels noticeably good when the brush head is rotating around the gums. Still the best prescription for good oral hygiene requires a lot more than just toothpaste and brushing at least once a day: You should use: * A tongue scraper * dental floss * a battery-powered/ electric toothbrush * a reputable toothpaste. But, this Crest Pro-Health is excellent."
5.00,"my dentist recommended this product. he said it was a very good product prohealth."
5.00,"I would recommend this product to anyone..Feels like your mouth is very clean"
3.00,"First of all, I think this is a quality product that is put out by Crest. It has a decent flavor, but not my favorite. It does make my mouth feel clean and my teeth feel clean and smooth also. The main negative point that I have to make is that for the size of the bottle the price is very high."
5.00,"My kids with braces love it. swear it helps them keep their braces cleaner without so much crud building up."
5.00,"Crest Pro-Health worked just like I had gone to the dentist and had a cleaning done. I love the feel of my teeth after having my teeth done so its nice to have the toothpaste that helps you keep the cleaning feeling longer."
5.00,"Really really liked this product. I would be sure to use it and recommend it to others."
4.00,"I love Crest Pro-Health toothpaste, leaves my teeth feeling as if I had just gone to the dentist."
5.00,"My teeth have been pretty white buy my son's are a different story. In the last few months we have been using Crest Pro Health and you can see the difference. Daily you can feel the clean difference. This is a great product."
4.00,"a little spendy, but tastes good for the \"extras\" it has for a toothpaste"
4.00,"Good product, easy to use and fresh flavor. Size is a bit small, but color and flavor make up for it."
4.00,"After turning 60, I noticed my teeth weren't as white as they should be. I began using Crest and I have noticed my teeth are much whiter. My mouth also feels clean."
2.00,"I had great hopes for this product. It may be effective, but is not pleasant to use. It is grainy, chalky, and tastes strongly like old-fashioned Chicklets gum. I could not detect any extra length of effectiveness to warrant the \"ovenight\" feature, to offset the unpleasant afertaste or gumminess at time of use."
5.00,"I have very sensitive teeth and find this product invaluable. Before using this toothpaste I had been using other name brand toothpaste for sensitivity but prefer this brand much better. I no longer experience the sensitivity I used to have on a daily basis. The taste is great and leaves my mouth very fresh. I am so thankful for this product and would highly recommend to others."
5.00,"I just purchased this clinical rinse and love it. My teeth feel much cleaner after using."
4.00,"I really like this toothpaste. It makes my teeth feel clean, and I know that I am protecting them against damage at the same time."
5.00,"I love this toothpaste! It makes my teeth feel so clean every time I brush. I have noticeably whiter teeth and less plaque according to my dentist!"
1.00,"Unlike many reviewers, my teeth haven't turned brown, but I've only used this twice in the past two days. I noticed after both times though, there's an incredibly bitter taste in my mouth, similar to earwax (gross, I know, but everyone has had that gross taste in their mouth once in their life.) I thought it was my new toothpaste, but it turns out it's this mouth wash. My tongue goes slightly numb, and I have the earwax-y taste in my mouth for upwards of 3 hours after washing. I tried rinsing with water and re-brushing the taste and feeling away, all to no avail. Another disgusting side effect that I've only seen a few people mention is the blue flecks left in my mouth after use. I have to scrape them off with my nail, as simply washing my mouth with water doesn't work. They stick to my tongue and on my teeth. It's not a lot, but enough to be worrisome. It's really very disgusting. Needless to say, I poured the rest of the bottle down the drain. I will update if there is any brown stains that come prior to stopping the use of this. Like the 90% of people who don't recommend this, I suggest you avoid this at all cost. I bought this at my local Walgreens, so I was unaware of the side effects before I bought it. Hopefully, reader, you have found these reviews before you try it. If not, I sympathize with your mouth and suggest you stop using this product immediately."
5.00,"Crest Pro-Health Collection Kit has all four things you need to help you in your war on dental plaque. I enjoyed the toothbrush, its comfortable on the teeth and it'll clean all of the nooks and crannies in your mouth. The toothpaste is really top notch. I enjoyed the taste and it really starts to work once you start brushing. The floss is most important and I like the Glide Pro Health. The floss wont get caught in your teeth like other brands I've tried in the past. Finally to cap off everything is the mouth wash. The Crest Pro Health rinse really gets washing around inside. Best of all it doesn't burn. If you are looking for an all-in-one kit for your dental needs then look no further than the Crest Pro-Health Collection Kit."
5.00,"Love that fresh clean feeling!! It has a great taste too!!"
5.00,"Teeth feel very clean for a long time after using this product."
5.00,"This product left my mouth feeling clean and fresh."
4.00,"I really do like this mouthwash. It leave your teeth feeling clean and your mouth feeling fresh. The only downside is it isn't a whitening mouthwash which I prefer."
4.00,"I really like this mouthwash. I like the taste & the way my mouth feels clean after using. The product seems to foam a little in the mouth which takes a little getting used to. I would definitely buy this product again."
5.00,"This has become my favorite toothpaste. Before I found this one, I would switch brands every month or so, but no more. I now refuse to use any other brand, or even any other Crest products. The clean feeling from this is just excellent. And it works wonders with stains from coffee and cigarettes."
1.00,"I don't understand how this is for sale. First of all, it makes brown stains in your teeth. Second of all, it leaves a slimy stringy residue in your mouth. Third, my gums are burning and have red blisters and it feels like my mouth is full of canker sores! My mouth was great until I used this for 1 week. That's all it took to turn my mouth into a painful mess. I'm very upset about this waste of money and how uncomfortable I feel as a result of brushing my teeth. I couldn't figure out what was happening until I googled it."
1.00,"Zero stars! I saw the advertisement for this product and thought I would try it, since it claims to keep plaque from forming for two months after cleaning. I used it for the first time at night after flossing and brushing, carefully rinsing the toothpaste from my mouth. Despite having no alcohol, I felt a burning sensation while using it...the same as with mouthwash products containing alcohol. When I woke up in the morning, I had a terrible taste in my mouth. It was pretty much the same \"morning taste\" I used to have years ago before I quit smoking. I had some breakfast, which tasted a little \"off\", but I didn't attribute the taste to the rinse. I then brushed my teeth after eating and used the rinse again. When I ate lunch, I noticed that it didn't have much taste at all. I ate a couple of Hershey's Kisses for dessert, and all I could taste was salt and a little bit of chocolate. They didn't have any sweet taste at all. That's when I realized that this must be the result of using the rinse. I even tried brushing my tongue to get rid of the effect of the rinse. After reading many reviews of this product, I only hope my sense of taste comes back. The product needs a strong warning that loss of taste can be a side effect. Better yet, it should be pulled from the market. I WILL be contacting the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission regarding this product."
5.00,"The toothpaste tasted good after I brushed and my mouth felt very clean. Highly recommend!"
3.00,"My fiance likes it, but I think it has a weird aftertaste. I also think toothpaste should not be crunchy. It's weird."
5.00,"I LOVED IT IT LEAVES YOUR BREATH FEELING FRESH AND CLEAN"
5.00,"Tried many mouth washes, however this is the best mouth wash out there. Nice taste and with multi-protection you can not go wrong!"
5.00,"I tend to use any floss that is on sale but I must say that Glide floss beats the rest hands down. I is one of the few products I will now be very picky about."
5.00,"me and my family like it it has fresh taste we will use it and i will recomend my freinds also to use it"
5.00,"This is a very good toothpaste. I recommend it to everyone!!!!!!"
5.00,"The Crest toothpaste made my teeth feel amazing!! Felt like I walked out of the dentists office."
2.00,"I received this 4 oz. tube from a dental hygienist after getting my teeth cleaned. She said my gums need better care, especially after I had been using a whitening mouthwash that irritated the tissue and caused my mouth to peel every morning. Ironically, this toothpaste also makes my mouth peel and I only use it once a day (I only brush my teeth at night, usually). It doesn't hurt and I don't notice any other side effects except for this. My gums aren't peeling - just my cheek tissue, specifically the part resting against my lower gums/teeth. I'm not really sure what to make of that as it doesn't seem particularly harmful. This toothpaste does tingle more than typical toothpaste. I'm not sure if my mouth peels because it is trying to get rid of bacteria or if it peels simply because of the toothpaste. This specifically happens the morning after I use this toothpaste. If I use a different toothpaste one night, the next morning my mouth is fine - no peeling."
3.00,"oh i wont be buy this mouth wash ever again..Its ok while you are useing it but as soon as you spit it out, you get this nasty taste of i dont know what?? maybe proxid? oh its bad...alsmost like cleaning your teeth with arm in hammer...yuck... Hope it works out for someone else..."
1.00,"Last night I had a pretty bad tooth ache, and in my frustration I ran to the bathroom and swished some of this stuff until the feeling left. I had to do this several times throughout the night, but eventually got it to where I could sleep. When I woke up my tongue was painful and swollen, the front of the top half much like what happens when you attempt to ingest freshly brewed coffee, but the bottom is a different story all together... The bottom half feels like someone is squeezing habanero pepper juice on it constantly, and because of this I can't fall asleep because the moment the bottom of my tongue hits the bottom of my mouth, I'm in EXCRUCIATING pain. Hoping I can somehow get to sleep and rest this s*** all out."
3.00,"It isn't my favorite of Crest's toothpaste because the mint flavor has a strangely granular texture that I could'nt quite get used to when I brushed. However, the quality of the Crest products remains intact as it was still effective against tooth plaque build-up. Only mildly recommended."
3.00,"This toothpaste cleans very well, but I do not like the taste. It also seems to leave an aftertaste, unlike regular Crest."
5.00,"Great product! Left my breath fresh and my mouth feeling clean for hours!"
5.00,"After trying this toothpaste, I felt that it worked great. My teeth felt clean, my breath was fresh, and I was happy with the clean feeling it gave me. I would buy this toothpaste again."
4.00,"This is an odd grouping of products. It is a great way to try all the Crest products, but I would never buy this collection on a regular basis. I have purchased the toothpaste before, but I've had never tried the mouthwash, and I like it a lot. I will definitely buy the toothbrush again."
5.00,"I loved how after brushing it left my teeth feeling so smooth and polished. The minty flavor is a good way to wake me up in the morning."
4.00,"I love this mouthwash. I used to never use mouthwash because I could never find one that I left my mouth feeling clean without the burning, but this one has done it!"
5.00,"This mouthwash was the first that felt like it was cleaning without burning me!"
5.00,"The toothpaste had a really good flavor and left my teeth feeling clean. My family and I have used it now for over two weeks and we all agree we will purchase it again."
5.00,"I hate it when my teeth feel yucky. I wish I could have that feeling of just getting my teeth cleaned all the time. This toothpaste sure helps with that. It made my teeth and mouth feel clean and refreshed."
5.00,"Cleans my teeth very well and has great flavor."
5.00,"Crest Pro-Health mouth wash has a refreshingly great taste, without the burn of alcohol. It leave yor mouth feeling clean and refreshed. It is a great product, however it is a little pricy."
1.00,"I purchased this because it was a good deal and well reviewed. I have been using Rembrandt, which is costly and sometimes hard to get on Amazon. Switching from Rembrandt to Crest Pro Health is one of the worst experiences I have had with toothpaste. My teeth do not feel clean. The toothpaste feels like hair gel compared to the texture of other toothpastes. It is incredibly blue and leaves a visible stain after brushing. It tastes like pure sugar and fake mint. I did not even know I cared this much about toothpaste until I switched. I've since given the toothpaste to my roommates and bought a three pack of Rembrandt."
4.00,"I've been a Scope kind of person for ages, but decided to give this and the Crest Pro-Health toothpaste a try. It's been a month, and I have yet to see any stains resulting from use. Not saying it doesn't happen, just hasn't happened with me (yet?). For the time being I'm going to stick with it. On the Pro side, it tastes fine and really doesn't \"burn\" like other brands (even other Crests). On the Con side, it's a little pricey and I think I have a mental hurdle that if it's not burning, it's not working. But I know there's no reason to think it's any less effective than a mouthwash with alcohol, which also dries out my mouth. If for no other reason, this makes it a good alternative. But I'll keep an eye out for the staining and come back with an update if there's an issue."
5.00,"this toothpaste does it all...& tastes great, too!"
5.00,"A great product that I plan on using now, made my teeth feel very clean and left my breath minty and refreshed"
4.00,"I liked how the mouthwash tasted. I have used other brands and they tasted like medicine. This I would continue to use."
1.00,"This product seemed to work temporarily, but within a month I had white sores all over my mouth, with peeling gums and tissue, inflamed gums, and even peeling on the outside of my mouth. I was very concerned, but just thought it was something I was eating. So I tossed out anything that could be irritating in hopes that the problem would go away. It didn't, it stayed the same for 2 months. I have a mild form of dermatitis, and even thought maybe that was causing the peeling in and outside of my mouth so I eventually made an appointment with my dermatologist. The appointment came, and the dermatologist knew right away that wasn't related to the dermatitis. It was an allergic reaction to the ingredients in this toothpaste. His instructions were to immediately stop using the toothpaste, and start using TOM's of Maine. Within a week of doing this, the peeling went away and most of the inflamed tissue returned to it's original color. Also, my sister and mother had the same exact symptoms after using this toothpaste so I wouldn't recommend this product to my worst enemy."
5.00,"I really love this product, it made my mouth feel fresh and clean."
4.00,"After switching to crest I realized what i was missing in my regular toothpaste. I would highly recommend this."
5.00,"My husband is a mouthwash fanatic and really loves this product. He couldn't wait to try it when I brought it home - he was not let down. He said his mouth felt clean and it had a nice flavor."
5.00,"My teeth felt squeaky clean. It was great to brush my teeth and get that feeling that I just left the dentist."
5.00,"This product is great it made my mouth feel real clean. I will recommend it to all my friends"
4.00,"This is a somewhat gritty toothpaste that tasted okay and made my teeth feel clean. I am a little concerned, however, about whitening agents in toothpaste after being warned by my dentist that they can make my teeth overly sensitive to hot and cold. I would not use this as my everyday toothpaste, but I think it would be a good one to use occasionally to remove stains."
5.00,"It was excellent. Fresh and clean tasting. My teeth and gums felt clean. It was very refreshing."
5.00,"It's a bit pricey but overall a great product i feel fresh all day using this mouthwash"
5.00,"I've been using Pro-Health products by Crest since they came out and have continued to buy them as I find them to be effective and I really like the minty feeling of all the products."
5.00,"I have been using this toothpaste for awhile- got my first sample of it from my dentist- fabulous! I am now using this toothpaste and the mouth rinse every day."
4.00,"Not gritty, great clean, minty taste. My whole mouth felt refreshed."
4.00,"I really like the Pro Health mouthwash. It has a good flavor and I really felt like my teeth were cleaner after using it. I like that it is suppose to help plaque and gingivitis too."
2.00,"I'll admit I loved this toothpaste at first. The taste and texture are both pleasing (who knew that was possible with a toothpaste?) Over time, though, I noticed the staining that others have mentioned. Then suddenly the inside lining of my mouth began peeling off and my gums started to almost burn. It must have been some sort of reaction to the stannis chloride. This took a while - I had just purchased my second tube when I noticed the issues and stopped using the toothpaste. A week later I was at my dentist for my routine cleaning. The hygientist asked if I had been drinking a lot of coffee (she'd normally ask if I smoked but she said she didn't smell it on me and realized I didn't smoke). She said the staining was significant. I told her it was the toothpaste! She knew right away and said, \"Crest Pro-Health? I've heard some complaints.\" She had to use a salt solution to \"sandblast\" the staining off of my teeth. It was less than pleasant. On another note, though, my dentist commented on how healthy my gums and teeth were, and how I hardly had any gingivitis at all. So, go figure. This stuff is very good at death and destruction - whether it be your mouth or the bacteria in it!"
4.00,"Makes your teeth and mouth feel really clean and refreshed"
5.00,"I am loving this toothpaste. It leaves my mouth feeling very clean. The taste isn't too strong."
5.00,"Teeth felt clean and smooth would recommend this product to friends and family."
5.00,"I have been using the Pro-Health toothpaste for gum protection and it leaves my mouth so clean and fresh! I recently went for my 6 month cleaning at the dentist and was found to have some minor gum issues. I am hoping by using this toothpaste as well as other products, my gums will be healthier."
1.00,"I switched to this product about a month ago and only recently found it was the issue of several mouth issues. I don't have ulcers per se, but large pieces of the top layer of tissue in my mouth will peel off for no reason. I will wake up with tissue in my mouth that has come detached in the night. DEFINITELY the tooth paste, as I have never had this problem before switching. I also don't have any food allergies, so I don't know what else it could be. Will stop using this toothpaste immediately."
5.00,"THE MOUTHWASH WAS GREAT IT MADE MY MOUTH FEEL FRESH FOR HOURS. AND UNLIKE OTHER MOUTHWASH IT DIDN'T BURN. I HAVE SENSITIVE TEETH SO SOME PRODUCTS REALLY BOTHER MY MOUTH BUT NOT THIS ONE."
1.00,"This mouthwash is the worst thing I have ever put in my mouth. It foams up because of the hydrogen peroxide, which is annoying, but not a big deal. However, after I used it, my sense of taste was severely dulled for the rest of the day, and my full sense of taste didn't return until the day AFTER that. I thought it may have been a fluke, so I tried it the next week. Same thing, and this time it was worse. I never used it again, and in fact I poured it down the drain. In addition, this product contains cetylpyridinium chloride, which over time can actually STAIN your teeth! STAY AWAY FROM THIS!!! Seriously, Crest, take this crap and shove it someplace."
5.00,"Love this product. Love the fact that it does not burn. That is important to me."
4.00,"It is a pretty good mouthwash. Not too strong and works well"
1.00,"I've been using this stuff for about 6 months now, and just realized today that it has been staining my teeth. I started noticing brown spots on my teeth a little while back and couldn't figure out what was going on. They weren't sensitive so I knew it wasn't cavities, but I never would've expected it was my mouthwash. I read on other reviews that others have had the same problem, I just can't believe it took me this long to figure out that it was the mouthwash causing these problems! I'm throwing out both my crest mouthwash and toothpaste and going to something else! Happy shopping!"
1.00,"I bought this rinse because my hygenist wants me to use a fluoride rinse. I liked the taste of it, but I began to notice that the outer edge of my tongue felt burned and my sense of taste was greatly diminished. I was completely puzzled because I could not remember burning my tongue with hot food and it just would not heal (tongue burns usually heal in one or two days at the most). I tried elimintaing my morning coffee, because I thought maybe it was causing irritation to my burned tongue and preventing it from healing, but I noticed no change. Then after three weeks of using the Crest Pro Health Complete rinse, it finally occurred to me that maybe the RINSE was causing the burned tongue and diminished tatse sensation! I discontinued using the rinse and my tongue began to heal, taking approximately one week to get mostly back to normal. After figuring out that the rinse was causing the tongue burn, I did a search on the internet and found I am not alone! In fact, I feel lucky that I did not experience the brown stains that others have! I followed the directions published from Crest Pro Health for a refund under their satisfaction guarantee, but they rejected it saying that the UPC did not match the cash register receipt! I am really angry, because it DOES match and I submitted the refund request exactly as per their directions. I am not going to waste any more postage to resubmit only to get rejected again. I have contacted Crest through their website and expressed my dissatisfaction with their product and with their refusal to stand behind their product. I will never recommend Crest to anyone."
5.00,"My son used this and liked it so much that he continues to ask for it."
4.00,"This toothpaste really did leave my mouth feeling clean and fresh, as it promised. The flavor was a little strong, but not so much as to keep me from using/buying it. I would use it again."
4.00,"I am a big mouthwash user, using it 3 times a day usually. I have tried other pro health rinses and this one was my favorite. The other ones left a weird film on my teeth that I didn't like the feeling of, however this one did not. The taste was nice and it made my mouth feel clean for hours. The only bad thing I can say about it is that the peroxide in it I'm guessing made white foam form in my mouth that I had to spit out after using the wash. I guess that means its killing germs so it's not really bad. I would buy this again if I Cought it on sale and had a coupon."
5.00,"Teeth clean and bright. its taste is pleasant, you can feel safe, you're using a quality product"
5.00,"I loved how this toothpaste felt in my mouth. It did not leave a chalk feeling in my mouth after I brushed. It had a mild flavor and my teeth felt very clean."
5.00,"Love this product....it makes my teeth and mouth feel clean and fresh, also it has a very pleasant taste."
5.00,"I want to thank you for giving me the chance to try these products I was very pleased with them. The toothpaste was great it may my teeth feel very clean. The taste was great. I would recommend this to my friends and family to try also. I was also very pleased with Glide Floss and toothbrush and oh the mouthwash was great also. I hope that I can continue to receive things to try. I really like this program. Thank You Again!!!!"
5.00,"Until recently, I've had a hard time finding a great toothpaste that leaves my teeth sparkling, gives me fresh breath and protects against gum disease. Crest Pro Health has been a game changer for me. Now I rock a confident Crest Pro Health smile. Crest Pro Health Toothpaste now has it's own line on my grocery list"
4.00,"It is not a high quality product but seems to be good for cleaning well..."
5.00,"I am currently using the Plaque Control Toothpaste (I also bought the Glide Floss, which I love). I wear a mouth splint at night and I have been having problems with plaque building up on the back of my lower teeth, which my dentist says can be a problem for splint wearers. Well, since I have been using the Crest Plaque Control... no more issues! :-) My teeth are super clean and feel nice and slick, like I just got a cleaning!! Highly recommend the toothpaste!!"
5.00,"This toothpaste really left my teeth feeling extra fresh and clean!"
4.00,"This maouthwash helped my family and I a great dela- although the whitening part is not extreme- it does leave ur outh feeling clean. No severe burning or irritation. Works well with the crest toothpaste !"
4.00,"I would definitely recommend this product, especially to people who have dental problems. The taste isn't bad and it works really well!"
4.00,"Nice feeling on your teeth helps with a fresh clean feeling mouth"
4.00,"My teeth feel fresh, good product for the price. I will be purchasing again."
3.00,"this is my first time trying the pro health toothpaste so im not sure if this is normal but the moment it makes contact with my teeth i can feel a warm reaction caused by the toothpaste. besides the warm sensation all over my mouth as i brush, the taste is just ok. the minty-ness is not that strong so after you rinse there is no long lasting minty fresh feeling in your mouth like with other popular toothpastes."
4.00,"I have been using various Crest products for many years and appreciated being offered a sample of the Crest Pro-Health Clean Mint to test and review. Obviously, I am not a dentist, I am a consumer, and I can only report from my side of the equation. This tastes fresh and minty. It leaves my mouth feeling clean. In other words, it does everything I expect a toothpaste to do. Best of all, it helps with my sensitivity - something I have developed as I grow older. Unlike other sensitivity toothpastes, this one actually doesn't make my mouth feel funny afterwards. The one thing I noticed is that you are only supposed to use this for four weeks unless you have your dentist's permission to continue using it. So keep it as a \"heads up\" if you are considering this, especially since it comes in a pack of 4. Suggest unless you have your dentist's thumbs up in advance, you purchase this in a smaller quantity."
5.00,"tastes great and ot medicinal,. Great for teeth and gums."
4.00,"I would recommend this to a friend, and it's a great product!"
5.00,"I love how my teeth felt smooth clean and fresh after using this product. Will definitely purchase this and more from the brand in the future."
4.00,"Used crest complete recently. It worked just like any of my other toothpastes I use for fighting plaque and cavitives. Nothing too new. Like the flavor though."
1.00,"\"In some cases, rinses may cause surface staining to teeth. This is not permanent or harmful, and may be prevented by adequate brushing or removed at your next dental visit.\" This warning appears on the bottle in very small print (and in the Amazon listing). I do not understand why Crest would sell a dental product that makes teeth look WORSE! My daughter was already self-conscious about teeth that are not white and decided to step up her dental care with more brushing, flossing, and mouthwash. I trusted the Crest name and did not read this tiny warning when I bought the rinse. After 2 weeks of use, she figured out that the brown color on her teeth coincided with the time she started using this product. We threw it out and have made an appointment for an extra cleaning at her dentist. An internet search shows that complaints like this go back to at least 2008 - yet the product has not been changed. DON'T USE THIS STUFF!"
5.00,"I used the Crest ProHealth toothpaste. It is minty fresh but doesn't gag you with too much mint. The advertising on the box and the way my teeth felt after brushing really made me feel like I was doing the most I could do to have the cleanest freshest mouth."
4.00,"This crest toothpaste is really good. I grew up on the original mint gel toothpaste, and I have to say this by far exceeds the original product. Thank you."
5.00,"Loved this product and our family always uses Crest toothpaste."
5.00,"The toothpaste tastes great and really seems to clean my teeth."
5.00,"I love how clean my teeth get and feel. They stay fresher longer and I love the way my breath stays fresh as well."
4.00,"I love this! Great clean feeling and taste! It tastes much better than other brands and I love the extra features!"
4.00,"My kids have been using this toothpaste and love it! I only wish our sample was bigger because we ran out and had to buy more! I also love the mouth rinse. It doesn't burn and does a nice job keeping my mouth minty fresh!"
5.00,"Left my mouth feeling clean and fresh. Great product."
5.00,"This is my favorite toothpaste (other than Colgate Junior but I'm a little old for that now). I think it's odd that many other people say this burns their mouth and is too harsh when I have the opposite effect. For me, most other toothpaste products are so loaded with chemical mint flavor that the inside of my mouth feels like it's on fire whereas this toothpaste is pretty mild and doesn't make me feel like I'm ablating the inside of my mouth every time I brush my teeth."
5.00,"Very pleasantly surprised !!! I sometimes can not always brush my teeth while at the office. Keeping this mouth wash at my desk. Is prefect !! And notice my mouth, teeth and dry mouth. look and feel better. Give me the confidence I need and want during an important meeting. Just a quick rinse during the days when I can not brush....over all very impressed !! And honestly recommend we keep this in restroom. At all times~~thank you Crest and Vocal point. !!"
5.00,"I've used this every day for two years. I am a coffee drinker. Several cups a day, strong coffee black. This toothpaste has kept my teeth looking OK in fact they look better than when I started using it. The last dental visit, the dentist said \"you must not drink much coffee or tea since your teeth aren't stained.\" I've had no peeling, sores or anything else described by some people, it may be that some people are more sensitive to these things than others, if you are use something else, the market is full of whitening toothpastes. Colegate didn't work as well for me, maybe it will work better for you, hard to say? In any case, my only concern is I wonder if using whitening toothpaste daily will weaken tooth enamel over time? I don't know either way."
5.00,"good value, nice taste"
5.00,"This toothpaste has polishing properties which scrub your teeth. So far, seems to help with stains. Have not used it long enough to totally evaluate and have not been to dentist since using."
5.00,"This is a great product! My teeth are already whiter!"
1.00,"I purchased this toothpaste thinking it was the same as Crest Sensitivity. Boy was I mistaken! This is the worst toothpaste I've ever used. It is extremely strong compared to other toothpastes, as it has a much higher concentration of alcohol and peroxide. This can result in chemical burn of the mouth (sloughing off of the skin in you mouth). If you're looking for Crest Sensitivity toothpaste, don't make the mistake I made and get this. This is not what you're looking for."
5.00,"Crest Pro-Health Clinical Gum Protection Toothpaste is my favorite toothpaste. My dentist recommended it because my gums were starting to recede. I prefer the soothing smooth mint over the invigorating clean mint flavor but both are good if you like mint. I really like the tube this stuff comes in, the cap is flat so it can sit upright in my medicine cabinet and the opening is just the right size for a toothbrush. Make sure you get the 5.8 size as the 4.0 size is too small and you will blow right through it. It is a little on the pricey side but Crest is a name you can trust. I was shocked to read so many negative reviews on Amazon but have not had any of the problems other users have experienced. My advice is to give it a shot if you have poor gums and see how it goes."
5.00,"I love the way crest cleans. No better toothpaste around."
5.00,"I have been a Crest product user for years but just recently have been using the Crest ProHealth toothpaste and mouthwash. I must confess they are a great new line up for Crest. My teeth not only feel cleaner after each brushing but look cleaner. Combining the ProHealth line of toothpaste and mouthwash make for a fresh long lasting effect with fresh breathe as well. My mouth feels as clean if not cleaner than going to the the dentist and a lot less invasive. I highly recommend the whole Crest ProHealth line of products as a sure defense for your teeth and mouth needs. Try it you will definitely like it and so will your mouth."
5.00,"This stuff made my mouth feel amazing! Got a great clean, fresh fizzy feeling!"
4.00,"I have two 4 year old girls who absolutely love this product. They like the taste, but fortunately don't eat it. The princesses on the front keep them running to the bathroom to put toothpaste on their own brushes. Not much else to say about toothpaste, but if the characters make it more fun for them, I'm all for it!"
4.00,"i was a little iffy about trying this mouthwash, because i had a bad experience with the taste of other whitening mouthwashes but this one wasn't as bad as some of the others the taste wasn't too bad. would deffinately purchase this over the others"
5.00,"This mouthwash is my husband's favorite. He doesn't really like to take care of his teeth, so it makes me happy that I found a product he likes!"
4.00,"The Crest Pro- Health Clinical Plaque Control toothpaste was refreshing and gave my mouth a fresh, clean feeling. I really enjoyed using this product, will definitely buy it again!"
5.00,"It works great to make your mouth look and feel wonderfully clean and fresh."
3.00,"Like all Crest products it was great, left my mouth feeling great for a number of hours. I would buy again."
5.00,"There were good an bad reviews about this product. I tried it, and found it far superior to the other mouthwashes. I had NO discoloration, bad taste, etc. When a dental hygienist recommended it, I made attention -- glad I did."
3.00,"Compared to some others with same statements thought this had much better taste"
5.00,"The Crest mouthwash left me with a fresh breath clean mouth, I will be buying it again."
5.00,"I Liked The Toothpaste Very Much And So Did My Children It Leaves You Teeth Feeling Very Clean And Your Mouth Fresh."
5.00,"I love Crest products, leave my mouth feeling clean, fresh and healthy!"
3.00,"I thought this toothpaste was pretty good. It left my teeth feeling clean and that feeling lasted for awhile."
1.00,"My boyfriend and I first bought this toothpaste in January 2011. He used it at first, but complained of a bad taste and lip numbness after brushing, so I took the tube and forgot about it. I began using the toothpaste in April 2011, and immediately developed several ulcers on my tongue. I assumed these were due to the stress of finals and did my best to deal with them. A couple weeks later, after returning home, I developed a large, painful sore on the inside of my bottom lip. I didn't connect it with the toothpaste, but assumed it must have been a cold sore (though I had never developed one inside my mouth before this). After another couple of weeks of raw, sore, bleeding lips and gums, I decided to look up Crest Pro-Health Whitening toothpaste reviews online, and I found HUNDREDS of people who were experiencing the same problems as I was (and much worse)! DO NOT BUY THIS TOOTHPASTE! I'm not sure what it is that is so dangerous about the product, but I can't believe they're even selling this to the public. I only gave it one star because you aren't allowed to give it zero! Check out what others have to say about this product here: [...]"
5.00,"My new favorite toothpaste! Helps eliminate mild sensitivity and gently whitens teeth over time. This is a complete toothpaste that helps your teeth and gums."
5.00,"I have used Crest toothpaste most of my life, but like so many, occasionally I will try something different....but I always come back to my Crest! This new clinical toothpaste is the best....leaves my teeth feeling really clean, smooth and my mouth so fresh. I would recommend this one to everyone. Try it you will love it!!!"
5.00,"My mouth has never felt and looked quite so clean and white as after I used this line of products. And the laundry list of benefits covers everything I worry about with my family's dental health."
5.00,"I really enjoy this mouthwash, it cut down on the plaque on my teeth a great deal and I like the taste of it as well."
5.00,"My mouth felt clean and cool after I used this toothpaste, and the taste was very pleasant."
5.00,"This product makes my teeth feel nice and fresh and clean. I've used many other whitening mouthwashes and this is by far the best!"
4.00,"The taste was great. It didn't foam up as bad as some other brands do in your mouth. I've been using this for about a week and can already see a difference."
1.00,"This toothpaste is the worst toothpaste I have ever used. It is gritty and leaves a terrible taste in my mouth. I would not recommend this toothpaste to my worst enemy."
4.00,"Nice product with clean feeling. As a former dental hygentist can really tell a difference. Would recommend to others!"
1.00,"I grew up in the Listerine generation, so I can tolerate a lot if I think it will help me keep my teeth and gums healthy. But this mouthwash is way beyond me. Although it's very tempting to think that any mouthwash this strong must be doing a great job, I really have to wonder if a chemical that burns my otherwise healthy mouth and makes me salivate for three minutes after I spit it out can be all that good for me. I'm not going to find out because I am through with this unfortunate little experiment in oral hygiene..."
1.00,"My boyfriend loves this product. I bought my own and started with bleeding of my gums. I thought that'll stop after a while, but it just got worse. I started to notice my inner mouth felt funny afterwards, like the walls of my mouth sticking my teeth. I finally asked my boyfriend if he ever felt these symptoms, but he never did. After looking online, I found out the sticky feeling inside my mouth was from the inner skin peeling and sticking to my teeth. I have noticed my lips were much more chapped than before. I discontinued the use of this product. Does anyone know what ingredient is doing this? I would like to avoid it next time. For now, I'll go back to my previous toothpaste."
4.00,"This toothpaste is awesome, it certainly performs as advertised. You can feel the plaque disappearing with each brushing!"
1.00,"Very bad product. Turns teeth brown and causes loss of taste. This product legally should be removed from all stores until further notice."
5.00,"I loved the way my teeth felt slick and my tongue was refreshed after using"
5.00,"It leaves your teeth feeling clean, smooth & your breath fresh. I love it!"
4.00,"This is a great toothpaste! It's been a favorite of mine for a while, but I will continue to use it."
4.00,"just brushing alone was just not making my teeth feel clean enough. Adding the Crest Pro-Health mouthwash was just what I needed to make my teeth feel so clean! Love this product"
5.00,"Love this toothpaste! You can't go wrong with Crest, but I really liked the texture and taste of this particular kind."
4.00,"I tried the Crest Plaque Control toothpaste. It had a pleasant taste, cleaned my teeth nicely. I have used all the Crest toothpastes....I really didn't see much of a difference."
5.00,"Great toothpaste. It left my mouth feeling squeaky clean and I loved the feel of the toothpaste."
5.00,"It has a nice mint flavor and isn't too foamy. I my mouth feels fresh for quite a while after brushing."
4.00,"I live this mouthwash I would recommend it. It's so refreshing and leaves your mouth feeling fresh and clean and for the price it's great"
5.00,"I loved how crest made my teeth feel clean longer."
5.00,"I love Crest products and Crest Pro Health toothpaste is NO exception! It leaves your mouth feeling fresh and clean while working behind the scenes to keep it healthy! What more could be asked of it!?!"
4.00,"Almost too strong at first, but did leave my breath feeling and smelling fresh for hours. Won't know what it does for tarter until my next cleaning but I'm hoping it will be as good as it feels!"
1.00,"STAINED MY TEETH IN TWO WEEKS!!!!! HORRIBLE PRODUCT!!!! I started using and after two weeks noticed staining on my teeth, I quit using it about 3 weeks ago and the stains won't go away, even after using Crest whitening rinse. Plus I have braces so now I'm sure my teeth are going to be two colors. I'm furious......... Wonder how much this is going to cost me now!!! CB"
4.00,"This seemed to work really well and I didn't get sensitive teeth. I really recommend it."
5.00,"I really liked this mouth rinse ur mouth feels so fresh...awesome..I recommend it..."
5.00,"Love the taste and it's not harsh, like some rinses can be. Keeps me feeling fresh for hours!"
5.00,"I will most definitely repurchase this product. It left my breath fresh and feeling clean. A winner!"
5.00,"My teeth felt clean & smooth, my breath was fresh throughout the day! I had problems with my lower jaw bite (teeth crowding & turning in) that was causing excess plaque in hard to reach areas, I am hoping that my dentist will notice the difference on my next visit!"
5.00,"This product did exactly what was claimed and made my teeth feel clean and healthy"
4.00,"Loved the clean taste of the toothpaste. It felt like it was working from the second I started to brush my teeth."
5.00,"I loved the fresh taste. No burning effect. Left a clean and fresh feeling."
4.00,"I have been a user of Colgate Total for many years and I feel that that toothpaste is the best on the market. It would take a lot of convincing to get me to switch! Crest is a great brand though, and I feel that it is a personal preference. I think both brands make premium toothpastes."
4.00,"This product makes your mouth feel clean! It is wonderful!"
5.00,"I loved these products!! They do everything they claim to do and then some!"
4.00,"I really liked this mouth wash. It wasn't too strong, and it kept my mouth feeling fresh longer. However, it is priced too high for me to purchase on a regular basis. I would love if the price wasn't so high so more people like me would be able to use, and benefit, from this product as well."
3.00,"This toothpaste was ok. The taste was a little off."
5.00,"We love this mouthwash. It has a refreshingly cool mint taste, and it really makes your mouth feel fresh and clean, but without the sting that other mouthwashes can have. I've also found that where with other mouthwashes the fresh taste goes away after an hour or so, this really leaves my mouth feeling fresh for several hours. Our dentist offers this mouthwash in the bathroom for people to \"wash up\" before their appointments, and I can see why this is the kind he chose. Very highly recommended."
5.00,"I loved it, it worked surprisingly well! I will be buying this product from now on"
4.00,"I tried the Crest clinical mouth wash it last long the fresh effect what I like it helps to prevent gengivitis one thing don't like te after taste :) !"
4.00,"My teeth are looking brighter, I'm a coffee drinker and I'm always concerned about the brightness of my teeth. Also, unlike most toothpaste and mouthwashes, it didn't cause me to gag."
5.00,"great product, a little spicy for my mouth, but did leave a very fresh, clean feeling"
4.00,"This toothpaste has one of the better tastes for toothpastes that I have tried. It got my teeth clean, and left my mouth feeling clean for a long time, As far as I know it protected my teeth as well, I mean they didn't fall out or anything! The only downside was that it didn't do much on the whitening side, but then again I don't think many of the toothpastes out there do. So I would definitely recommend this to everyone."
4.00,"I liked how clean my teeth felt after using. My husband really likes it too."
5.00,"I received a sample of some Crest Pro-Health products. I am especially enjoying the toothpaste that I received. I feel my mouth is cleaner, the taste is great and doesn't burn my mouth, and it creates enough 'suds' to where I feel like my teeth are getting clean enough. Thanks!"
5.00,"I could tell an immediate difference in my teeth the first time I used this Crest porduct. They felt cleaner, just like after a cleaning at the dentist, and the coffee/tea stains were lighter, and got better with use."
5.00,"Best toothpaste around! I love the way my teeth feel after brushing!"
4.00,"I'm switching to Crest now, just love it..... the feeling, the long lasting flavor, the clean breath experience!!"
4.00,"Great fresh taste, and kept my mouth feeling clean"
5.00,"The toothpaste gives you that fresh from the dentist feel"
5.00,"I really liked this product! I have a sensitive mouth and I find that most mouthwash, and some toothpastes, really burn. I was able to use this without that burning feeling! Also, I like that it helps control plaque."
4.00,"I really enjoyed this mouthwash. It has a nice taste to it and leaves a wonderful clean feeling like the one you get after you've been to the dentist. It's a little too pricey in my opinion, but definitely a quality product."
4.00,"the toothpaste was good tasting and covered all the areas reccomended by my dentist to have in a toothpaste."
4.00,"I have never used a toothpaste that has gotten my teeth so clean."
5.00,"I used this rinse after I brushed my teeth this morning. It is now 3 hours later, ive had coffee and cheerios and I still taste the rinse. This is my first time using it and I am very happy with it. It does cost more then other rinses but it really works well."
2.00,"To be completely honest, it was nothing special. Just because it had the word \"clinical\" in the title makes it really no better. I was really hoping it would have a whitening benefit, but it does not. If I am going to pay a higher price for tooth paste, it has to have a whitening factor."
4.00,"I like the feel after product use, clean and fresh. I will possibly use again. I also use the crest pro health whitening."
3.00,"This is a nice minty flavored mouthwash. It does not contain alcohol so you won't get that burning feeling, but you still get a bit of a tingling sensation on your tongue. These alcohol-free mouthwashes tend to give me a dry-tongue feeling that I find annoying. I also don't feel the fresh breath sensation lasts very long with these kinds of mouthwashes."
5.00,"My entire family enjoy the taste of this toothpaste . It gives me a clean feeling on my teeth all day long ...."
4.00,"If it was proven the same effectiveness as brushing I'd do this over brushing any day! But since we all still need to brush, I use this right after! I even put some into a smaller bottle to leave in my purse. If I'm out to eat I just go to the ladies room rinse my mouth of any harsh scents (garlic, onion etc) and I'm not worried about my breath! It lasts a long time as well!"
1.00,"This is the first review I have ever wrote on a product. I had to write a review to tell you how terrible this product is. My lips began to tingle and feel cold. While I was at work my inside of my lips began to shed a white film. I thought I had something stuck in my teeth and realized my inside of my lips were peeling. My tongue hurt and my lips were red and tingling for a few days."
5.00,"Great toothpaste, love the flavor and how clean my teeth felt for several hours after brushing!"
5.00,"when i get up in the morning my mouth is still fresh.I love this product."
3.00,"I bought this product for my husband to try. He absolutely loves it. I on the other hand I cant get past the taste. It tastes like chalk and leaves a film in my mouth."
5.00,"When buying kids toothpaste it's really about who is on the bottle. We are a crest family but my son loves Jake and the Neverland Pirates so buying this was a no brainier. The fact that I could get it with the subscribe and save program and use a coupon was a bonus! My son loves the toothpaste and it goes great with his Jake toothbrush."
5.00,"This product is recommended by my husband's dentist. He uses the enamel protection formula . At each cleaning appointment, both his hygienist and the dentist have been pleased with the results provided by using Crest Pro Health formula toothpaste. Daily brushing has become more rewarding and less of a dreaded exercise."
5.00,"Once again, I am pleased with this brand. Crest is the only toothpaste I buy for my family, and I appreciate them continually making their products even better than before."
5.00,"I bought the toothpaste, toothbrush and rinse last night. I tried the toothpaste and rinse. I really liked the toothpaste because it was a cool feeling and a clean feeling in my mouoth. I used the plague brand. I have a hard time brushing my teeth but I think with this toothpaste I may do a better job at it"
5.00,"This is a very nice assortment of dental products from Crest. It would make a wonderful gift for a student starting college or similar situation. The product sizes are generous (not trial or travel sizes). Please note that this is the alcohol-free mouthwash intended to cause less burning than the traditional mouthwash. While some may prefer the alcohol-free, others complain that it leaves an after-taste and/or stains the mouth more than the traditional alcohol-based mouthwash."
4.00,"I love this mouthwash. it made your mouth feel so fresh and I am purchasing the product again."
1.00,"This is definitely the worst mouthwash there is. I love crest pro health original, but this made my mouth numb, and completely took away my sense of taste. If I could give it 0 stars I would, but unfortunately amazon does not provide that option. Plus it tastes AWFUL. P.S: Never left a negative review in my life, but this was just awful."
5.00,"My teeth feel like I just left the dentist after using Crest Pro-Health."
5.00,"I found this toothpaste on sale which with the coupon I received made it a great deal. I like the great clen feeling your teeth have after you use this and you know if it;s crest the quality has to be there too!"
5.00,"I really liked the way my teeth felt after using the Crest. Minty clean and smooth all over. I love the Crest products and try to buy them all the time."
5.00,"Clean taste that isn't overpowering! Left my mouth feeling fresh and no \"sting\" afterwards! I really enjoy using the product!"
5.00,"Love, love, love it!! It was very refreshing and I will be buying it again and again"
5.00,"This mouthwash had a higher concentration of chlorine than the others, which I feel makes it more effective. It is also somewhat more expensive than other mouthwashes in the Crest product line due to the \"clinical\" labeling. This mouthwash does not say whitening, but it does contain peroxide. I enjoyed using this mouthwash."
4.00,"I usually pinch pennies on most items but certain things that are worth it I will splurge on and that is def. the case with crest pro-health products. Love them!"
5.00,"My teeth feel super clean. I really love this stuff. It works great."
5.00,"I love this line of mouthwashes. They leave your mouth feeling clean without a strong alcohol feeling some other washes have. They do an outstanding job freshening breath!"
5.00,"I've been using this product for several months and am quite pleased with the performance.  I have not had any issues with brown spots on my teeth, as some have written about.  One should be advised to brush and floss thoroughly, as the discoloration is a result of the mouthwash interacting with debris remaining on the tooth.                                                                     I have noticed consistently better breath and a healthier mouth overall.  This product has greatly reduced gum inflammation.                                                                     Overall, I would recommend the product with the caveat that brushing and flossing always be performed thoroughly before rinsing."
4.00,"There hasn't yet been a toothpaste that has been specifically made for seniors. But Crest has definitely been a brand that has appealed for generations of all kinds. They have definitely broke that mold for so many people. Their Crest Pro-health For Life Smooth Mint Flavor Toothpaste really tastes absolutely delightful. It really handles well for anyone that doesn't want a toothpaste that is too abrasive of their sensitive gums or enamel. I like this one because it really works on the money. Crest has really proven that for years and generations who have trusted Crest with any of their needs. I really recommend giving this a try if your are over 50 and looking for something great that keeps your whites more pearly from the inside out. Price: B Taste: B Overall: B"
5.00,"I have been using this for about 2 weeks now. I definitely feel an improvement on the surface of my teeth."
5.00,"Why don't stores carry this one anymore? Have to get it online. But worth it. Get a case, lasts for months."
1.00,"A few days ago, I noticed some dark brown stains on the inside edges of my teeth. I'm really good about brushing/flossing and I couldn't think of what the cause might be. I started searching online and found a news article about this mouthwash causing tooth stains. I went in the bathroom and, sure enough, I started using this mouthwash a couple of months ago. I am really mad. I realize there is a vague warning on the back, but I've been using mouthwash for 20 years with no problem so why would I be reading the fine print? I'm making an appointment to see if I can get these stains cleaned, but I really don't appreciate having to endure a deep cleaning just because I used the wrong mouthwash."
4.00,"I like the taste. It helped to keep teeth clean and fresh."
4.00,"Thank you."
5.00,"Fresh breathe and teeth is the experience I had when using the Crest tooth paste. I would recommend it to anyone and have."
4.00,"This was a great product and the price really surprised me with the value I received."
5.00,"Very Pleased. You can feel it cleaning. Helps with gum issues."
5.00,"Great taste, not too overpowering!!! Will keep purchasing it!!!!!"
5.00,"Nothing beats Crest at getting and keeping your teeth and mouth clean and bright."
4.00,"Enjoy using this toothpaste, does what it is supposed to - cleans my teeth!"
5.00,"I love this toothpaste. It leaves a very fresh, just been to the dentist feeling in my mouth"
5.00,"yes I loved this product it made my teeth feel new and clean just like after the dentist office."
4.00,"Live and die by Crest. Only toothpaste for me! Minty, breath-freshening and keep teeth healthy as well as gums. Great stuff."
3.00,"After years of using Tom's of Maine and Listerine Zero, I went back to the alcohol-based mouth wash a year ago.I noticed the difference and so did my dentist. Much less gum tenderness and bleeding (which I'm prone to despite insane dental hygiene).All the same, I don't care for the sting of the alcohol, so I tried this Crest Pro-Health for a couple weeks.1) It is very sweet. Even sweeter than the other products I mentioned above. I don't really like that first thing in the morning.2) After a week of use (which happens between flossing and brushing for me at night and before brushing in the morning), I started noticing more pink and red after flossing. This after having no gum bleeding for months and nothing else changed but for the mouthwash.Overall, found it to be o-k. I'm sure it would suffice for many people (especially those who cannot tolerate the alcohol stuff), but even if I was staying away from the 'sting' this was still too sweet for me."
5.00,"This product was great. Was a nice change and was refreshing."
3.00,"It cleans really well, but it doesn't taste well. Maybe they can add some sort of flavor to it"
5.00,"I bought Crest Pro Health toothpaste 2 weeks ago. I've used it twice a day for 2 weeks and can tell a huge difference. It leaves your teeth feeling very clean and can tell it is removing and preventing plaque. I will definitely recommend this to family and friends."
4.00,"I like this rinse. Left my mouth refreshed. A little on the pricier side than its competitors but I love the fact that it does not leave a burning sensation and has no alcohol. :)"
4.00,"I bought this rinse because I had oral surgery yesterday, filled a prescription for Chlorhexidine (a rinse), and wanted to have something comparable at work. (Not interested in carrying prescription mouthwash with me.) I don't expect to use the Chlorhexidine forever and have the same expectation for the Crest PH Clinical rinse. I'm not sure why other people buy this product, but that's my reason. My normal rinse is plain old yellow Listerine. As for the Crest PH Clinical, it contains Cetylpyridinium Chloride (CPC). Apparently CPC distorts your sense of taste for a while and I can attest to that, but it's not nearly as long for me as other reviewers are complaining about. I'd summarize the experience like so: a 30-second swishing will tingle the same as Listerine and will leave you with a filmy spittle thanks to the hydrogen peroxide. Your mouth will have a distinctly clean feeling afterward - some say metallic taste - for at least an hour. The first thing you eat or drink won't have much taste, but it'll start to have taste after a few minutes. Anyone who uses mouth rinse on a regular basis is used to this effect already. Try drinking orange juice five minutes after swishing with Listerine. The difference is that this stuff lingers longer.                                                                     The reason I give it four stars is because it contains CPC, which is recognized by the FDA as very effective against bacteria, other microorganisms, and is shown to prevent gingivitis. Those are what I am looking for in a post-operative oral rinse. I also like the minty taste and the addition of hydrogen peroxide. The aftertaste is expected since it is advertised as \"Clinical\", which conveys to me that it's stronger than your average rinse. The reason I don't give it five stars is because there's nothing special about CPC. It's been around a while and a variety of products have it.                                                                     My advice is to use lower-strength mouthwash for daily use. Reserve this for special occasions like surgery or infection. If you have gingivitis, brush better, get cleanings more often, or both. I'm not saying that a bad reaction to Crest PH Clinical means you have poor oral hygiene, but if you do have poor oral hygiene, you may want to try the traditional route of brushing, flossing, and regular cleanings first. This stuff wouldn't be a good substitute for good practices."
5.00,"I was impressed immediately that my mouth didn't feel like I was breathing fire from the mouthwash like some other brands do. Will definitely use again."
4.00,"This toothpaste makes my teeth feel clean and slick and my mouth feel fresh."
5.00,"I really like the fact that this toothpaste helps to control plaque for quite awhile and it leaves you with a nice clean feeling after brushing. I will definitely be buying it again."
5.00,"This product is pricey compared to the other ProHealth rinse that I normally use, but because I have weak teeth, I'm always looking for better products to help protect them. This feels like it works. It's pleasant to use, has a great aftertaste, and leaves my mouth feeling really clean for several hours after using it. I'd definitely recommend it to others and I will be buying it again."
5.00,"We grew up using Crest. Now we've switched - to Crest ProHealth! Superior producr, same great clean feeling."
5.00,"The mouth wash whiten the teeth real good. And the daughter loves."
4.00,"It is really important to me that my teeth are nice and white and healthy. That is also one of the first things I am looking at when meeting someone. A nice smile can go long ways. I love those products, they do exaclty that."
1.00,"I got my teeth cleaned two weeks ago, after which I purchased this product. I usually use natural products, but have been having some increased sensitivity so I decided to get this for the fluoride. I have excellent oral hygiene and take very good care of my teeth. I was very concerned when I noticed after brushing that the inside of my mouth felt shriveled and very dry. A few days later, I noticed terrible dark brown stains all over the bases and contacts of my teeth. I tried brushing more and more. It got worse and worse. And the product left a bad tasted in my mouth - my breath was not fresh. Also, a few hours after brushing my teeth, I felt a terrible film all over my teeth - as if I hadn't brushed at all. I started to think the toothpaste may not be safe. So I google \"brown stains on teeth\" and this product flooded my search results as the culprit. I was shocked - and yet vindicated - I knew it. So disappointed in Crest. Had been using them since I was a kid - now never again. Now I'm going to have to spend $200 to get my teeth cleaned. And I see now the warnings all over the tube for staining. Why in the hell would I buy a whitening tooth paste that turns my teeth brown??!! The funny thing is that if you search the product on Crest's website, it has very poor ratings, but only due to packaging complaints. It seems Crest must have deleted every comment regarding staining. So disappointing. Shame on Crest."
5.00,"This crest toothpaste is the best product I have tested. I usually buy another popular brand but I found that my mouth stayed fresher when I used the crest. I have noticed the difference and I love it."
5.00,"After using it for a few days, I loved the way it made my teeth feel. It was like that \"just got done with the dental hygienist\" feeling, but instead of only having it for a few days every 6 months, I had it everyday. Thank you! I will definitely be purchasing this in the future."
5.00,"Feels like you just had your teeth cleaned at the dentist every time you use it."
2.00,"This toothpaste left a \"coating\" feeling on my teeth."
5.00,"I've used Crest for years, and Pro-Health does not disappoint. My dental technician finds little plaque at my 6 month cleanings."
4.00,"The crest pro health clinical gum protection was recommended by our orthodontist. I have 4 kids and 3 are seen by an orthodontist. All 3 of my kids have said their teeth feel great after brushing. The mint taste was just right not too strong. They won't use any other toothpaste but this product."
2.00,"Although I solely use the Crest brand, this mouthwash has a terrible taste and left my mouth with a filmy feeling on my tongue."
4.00,"This product was excellent. Pleasant taste,clean feeling in mouth after use."
4.00,"I love how my fresh and clean my mouth feels after using this Crest Pro Health!"
4.00,"Love the taste and the fresh feeling it gives my mouth."
3.00,"I am sorry folks, but I felt this was just an average product. It is hard to tell is long term continual use is actually worth it. But as far as a day to day use, I find it to be like most products. Not bad, but not a stand out."
4.00,"I love the mint flavor and the texture. It felt like it was almost polishing my teeth. They felt very smooth a clean, and my breath was very fresh. The feeling lasted several hours."
4.00,"This rinse really keeps my mouth fresh longer and without alcohol. My teeth feel cleaner longer. I would recommend this product to my friends and family"
4.00,"I usually like using crest. it leaves a fresh taste and my teeth feel clean"
5.00,"I'm very cold sensitive and I've noticed a huge difference after two weeks using this toothpaste compared to regular toothpaste. I've far less sensitive and the minty taste is excellent, not too strong or too weak."
5.00,"This toothpaste does everything you need a toothpaste to do. My dentist recommends it over that other Total toothpaste that I thought was the best."
5.00,"I love the taste and how clean my mouth felt even after meals. Love this product!"
4.00,"Crest Clinical is an excellent mouth wash and leaves the mouth with a clean fresh feeling. I have had a better dental visit since using it."
5.00,"I very much recommend this toothpaste. It made my mouth feel fresh and clean!"
4.00,"The taste of the product was definitely not the best, but the feel of cleanliness afterwards did make a difference! I am all about a clean feeling mouth and I would definitely use this on a daily basis, I just wish the taste were a little better."
5.00,"I love this and would definitely recommend it. It made my mouth feel fresh and clean and lasted a long time."
3.00,"The toothpaste left my mouth feeling fresh and invigorated, but I didn't feel it was worth the much higher price."
4.00,"I purchased this toothpaste for our active family of teenagers and adults. Everyone seemed to like the results that they were getting from the toothpaste. We loved the fact that it was for sensitive teeth as well as a whitening formula. Would recommend this product since it cleans, protects, whitens and freshens breath all in one results."
4.00,"I got this collection a week or two ago, and wanted to share some thoughts with you after using it for a little while. While I love the idea of getting all the items together in an attractive package, and the idea that this might help people take better care of their mouths, the items have to be looked at individually. Here we go: Oral-B Pro-Health Clinical Pro-Flex Medium Toothbrush 2 Count One Toothbrush in the kit. I pulled this out of the package and said, \"Uh-oh.\" My dentist says that most adults use too much pressure when brushing teeth and she gives us all baby-soft toothbrushes to try and get around that. It took me a while to get used to the very soft toothbrushes. The medium toothbrush felt like barbed wire against my gums and didn't get my teeth any cleaner. Check with your dentist before using this one. (This is not necessarily what is listed in the kit contents. But it is what we got) Crest Pro-Health Clinical Gum Protection Soothing Smooth Mint Toothpaste, Twin Pack, 4 Ounce One Tube of Toothpaste in the kit. (I am not the Crest user in our house. The Crest user is my husband, who has used the stuff since childhood, and can't change to my toothpaste. He wants me to change to Crest. We just buy a tube of each and don't worry about it.) Anyway, he liked this toothpaste very much, saying that it ended the bleeding he had when brushing his teeth. He's already asked me to buy more when this is gone. Crest Pro-Health Rinse Refreshing Clean Mouthwash, Mint Flavor - 250 ml Wow! What a great product! I love, love, love the idea that it has no alcohol, unlike so many other rinses, so that leaving it out on the counter won't result in a drunken child. (Never happened to us, be we read the papers the school used to send home) The stuff is tingly, but doesn't have that horrible burning flavor that many mouthwashes have, and your mouth feels clean for a long time after you use it. I found this to be the big winner in the group. (Although my husband disagrees. He likes that toothpaste) Crest Glide Deep Clean Floss Cool Mint -- 43.7 Yards Most people will love this floss, especially if they have closely spaced teeth or are new to flossing. The ultra-smooth plastic tape in the kit is perfect for tightly spaced teeth - it gets right down in there without the user having to put lots of pressure on the floss, preventing the floss from snapping down on the gum and cutting it. The wide tape cleans well, removing particles and leaving a fresh, minty taste behind. If you aren't yet flossing each day, try this stuff (it comes in a roll like this or in pick form). You'll actually learn to like flossing. All of these items are very high quality, and if they fit your personal preferences, I'd buy this kit. However, since we use very soft toothbrushes, and one of us uses floss picks and the other likes fat floss, this kit isn't a great value for us. We're happy we got it, though. We both found the terrific mouthwash, which we probably wouldn't have tried otherwise; and DH found the toothpaste he likes, and he's even using the floss regularly. For the introduction value, it's a great deal. Otherwise, you might want to buy these high quality items separately."
1.00,"Oh God, I had a sample of this stuff and, while it tasted just fine, afterwards it tastes like there was ass in my mouth for the rest of the day. I can not recommend this product to anyone as the aftertaste is SO much worse than cranberry juice that I'd rather rinse cranberry juice."
1.00,"The next day after I used this I noticed a waxy, scratchy sensation in my mouth and wasn't able to taste much of anything. I didn't use it again to see if/when the symptoms would go away. Took about 5 days to return to normal so tried it again and found the same thing. I've stopped using it and will find something else not made by Procter and Gamble. I see people have been complaining about this stuff for years yet they continue to market it as something wonderful. Typical corporate greed, way to go P & G!"
5.00,"This is yet another in a long line of quality products from Crest. Clean teeth and fresh breath for a long time. What more can you ask for?"
5.00,"I love all of the Crest Pro Health products, but I think that the Toothpaste is the best. I use nothing else."
5.00,"I love the Crest Pro-Health Clinical Plaque Control. My teeth have never felt cleaner. The best thing about it is that my teeth still feel clean in the morning after brushing them at night."
5.00,"My teeth felt great after brushing with Crest Pro-Health. I liked the taste and consistency. What I am not crazy about is the style of the very large cap. Not sure why, but it seems to make things even messier. I thought because it was so large it would close better than those small flip-top caps. It actually doesn't close very well and is pretty large."
5.00,"I am really please with my purchase, and will continue to buy. Thanks Crest!!!"
5.00,"I was happy with the product. I thought it did a great job cleaning my teeth. I liked how my teeth felt after using the product."
5.00,"I used this toothpaste and immediatly felt like I had just gotten my teeth cleaned professionally. This works wonders."
4.00,"I really love the way this toothpaste makes my teeth look and feel. A great smile and healthy teeth are very important to me, and I achieve it with this toothpaste."
4.00,"Crest Pro Health products are superior to everyday toothpastes,rinses,and brushes I've used before. The rinse and toothpaste combined gave a post-professional cleaning feel to my teeth. Excellent products."
5.00,"TIDE he with Febreeze Sport is my FAVORITE laundry detergent!!! Love how fresh the clothes smell. It is finally available at the super store I shop at, only wish they carried a larger size--the biggest!"
1.00,"I bought this for the first time and used it as i thot Tide is a good brand.. but it smells yuck..just feel like vomiting after washing my clothes..cant stand the smell..just gonna throw this yuck and smelly detergent.."
4.00,"I have four active children and a husband that exercises a lot. I am ALWAYS doing laundry. So far the \"Sport\" detergent seems to help with the stale odors. I really like the \"Sport\" component, but I am not thrilled about the scent. I really wish you would offer it in the Mountain Spring scent! It would also help if you offered larger containers."
5.00,"I am a mom of two daughters, ages 8 and 2. My daughters and I LOVE the smell/scent of Tide plus Febreze, and Tide SPORT! Every week we strip the bed linens to wash them. After re-making their beds with their clean sheets and blankets washed in Tide plus Febreze, they can't wait to snuggle up under the covers, its nearly impossible to to keep them out of bed long enough to finish making it! Thank you tide for the Wonderful product. I think that, as my girls get older, and use this in their homes, it will bring back great memories of their childhood!"
1.00,"I tried this sports apparel formula a few times and its horrible. I purchased this to wash my Nike DriFit workout clothing. As is common with performance fabrics, they would come out of the laundry seemingly clean, but would develop a stale odor after about an hour's use. After washing, the clothing came out of the washer with an absolutely overpowering sweet/floral odor which didn't go away after line drying. When I wore a shirt laundered in this stuff to the gym, I became \"that guy\" - the one who wears strong cologne to the gym. About an hour into the workout, the awful Tide odor abated and was replaced by the same old stale odor. I ultimately found that a specialty detergent called ProWash actually cleaned the workout gear. Its expensive, but I limit its use to the workout clothing. Meanwhile, the Tide sits on the shelf and will probably be rinsed down the drain because the odor is so overpowering that I can't see using it on everyday laundry."
5.00,"Every weekend my 3 grandchildren come and spend time with Grandma. and Grandpa. I don't want to be doing laundry, I want to spend time fishing, catching frogs, making dumplings, painting, and making forts with all the blankets on the trampoline outside.. Just a few of the things my grandkids and I do together. On Sunday before Mom and Dad pick them up we throw all in the wash with my Tide HE and they are clean and fresh. Mom and Dad never know our secret. That's my Tide and I know I can depend on it. Love those grandkids to pieces."
5.00,"I love this detergent. I wash my fitness clothes with it and they smell great afterwards."
4.00,"Tide detergent is a well known, widely available, and proven brand.  This particular concentrated Tide formulation has the \"Ultra\" cleaning agents plus Febreze Fresh scent.  A consumer doesn't have to be a rocket scientist to know that this detergent works well; just sort clothes accordingly, add the appropriate amount of detergent with the smaller measuring cup, and let the washer do its job!  Of course always dissolve the powder first when the washer is filling with water before adding clothes (common knowledge).  Nevertheless, even with thorough rinse cycles, powder detergents may leave a slight film that may get heat-cured into clothes in the dryer.  That's why I prefer Tide liquid detergents with less residues after washing.                                                                     Main points: easy to use, fresh smelling detergent with effective cleaning capabilities but may leave some powder residues.  A bit pricey at $16.77 for a 63 loads container when local discount marts sell 120 loads concentrated Tide detergent for about $17.97."
5.00,"This stuff is great. Ive used it for over a year and I love it. I'm a smelly active person and I love the smell of this detergent. I still get a small smell from my clothes but Ive been using my clothes for over 2 years and its still not that bad compared to the other stuff I was using. Once this bottle runs out I will continue to use it. Plus its septic safe, which is a huge plus."
1.00,"I am so glad that I read another review on this product on Amazon, it only confirms my beliefs that I've been experiencing an awful and ITCHY allergic reaction to using Tide Sport with Febreeze on my bedding! As of about a week and a half ago, I had purchased new bedding (sheet sets) as well as this Tide Sport product. Around the same timeframe I began going to my doctor's office because I began having horrible hundreds of insect-bite looking marks all over my arms and legs that is extremely itchy! I have never had any type of allergic reactions to any products so my first reaction was that it must be bed bugs so I washed all of my sheets again, washed my comforter, took all of the necessary precautions, vacuumed everywhere, etc. but was still receiving new (nightly) bumps that appeared like insect bites on my skin. The doctor believed that it was either Folliculitis or bed bug bites because I only had been receiving more and more bite-like marks on my body after sleeping in those sheets (revelation: I've been washing repeatedly in the new detergent). I was even put on anti-itch antibiotics and creams due to this awful itching feeling (which only now makes sense because of this other review I read). I'm going to be purchasing a new laundry detergent and will re-wash all of my sheets and if I see a difference I will post an update to this negative review on Tide Sport with Febreeze."
5.00,"An excellent powder laundry detergent. It smells so fresh and the box seems to last for innumerable loads. This is easily one of the best powder detergents out there. Highly recommended."
5.00,"Love the smell of the Tide with Febreze detergent. I always use it to wash my husband's workout cloths They continue to smell great days later. I use the Tide with Bleach for our day to day cloths and the Tide Free and Clear for sheets and towels. I am a multiple Tide lover! Keep up the good work"
5.00,"Thanks for putting my 2 favorite items together in ONE :)"
1.00,"I rewashed all of my clothes and will stick with my original product. At least I tried it! I won't be recommending it to any of my friends."
1.00,"I am about to throw out most of a large bottle of this Tide because of the strong, unmustakably MUSTY smell it leaves in one's clothes. At first I suspected it was something else, like that my washer needed cleaning, but as soon as I stopped using this product the mustiness went away. Other varieties of Tide with Febreeze seem to exhibit the same problem, according to many reviews here at Amazon. I am going back to the All detergent I used before. Cheaper and no disgusting smell! I can't believe the Tide folks let this product out of the test lab!"
3.00,"I've tried this on several loads of wash.  I like the way the clothes smell right out of the washer.  Even the washer itself has a more pleasant scent after washing a load.  However, the scent deminishes once the clothes are removed from the dryer.  I had hoped my towel cabinet would retain that fresh clean scent, but alas it is not noticeable.                                                                     Another reason for not giving it the full five stars is the price.  It is almost twice the price of other effective detergents, and it doesn't contain a fabric softener... just the scent.                                                                     I love using fabric softener, so for me, it is not cost effective to have to buy this product, even though it is concentrated. I can get a nice fresh scent from other detergents, add my own softener which is also nicely scented, and get a satisfactory clean load of laundry done for about half the price. It does clean well, Tide products do, but I think most families that do a lot of laundry these days, in this economy, have to cut costs where they can, and in our family, this is one of the areas where we choose to do so. Manufacturers have to be aware of this. If you don't do much laundry, and can afford this, then go for it.  It is a good product, but you'll still need to add a softener for comfy towels and underwear."
5.00,"I'm a big fan of Tide and this scent is really nice and lasts a long time."
3.00,"Tide is a great detergent brand - one that I have used for a very long time. I typically enjoy the febreeze scents added to the tide as it makes your clothing very fresh smelling (there is one that has a purple color on the label) however, this particular version has a funny, overpowering almost chemically smell. While it still does the job as tide does the smell coming out of the bottle is a bit stinky."
1.00,"I have been using the original scent Tide for 20 years. But this \"spring renewal\"scent with febreeze smells awful. It ruined my batch of laundry and everything had to be washed again with an extra rinse cycle."
5.00,"I have had the task of writing your company a letter, concerning container size of Tide HE. The bottle was too tall to fit in my LG pedestal storage beneath my high efficiency washer. I had to place the bottle of Tide HE on it's side, making a mess every time I poured it out. I found this odd since this specific brand of Tide was made for such machines.After purchasing a new bottle of Tide HE, I was happy to see that the size of the bottle has changed and now fits beneath my washer. You have saved me a letter ... except this one to thank you! Thanks so much for accommodating us HE machine, pedestal users. It's the little things that make my day brighter! :)"
5.00,"Good addition to laundry cleaning products. I guess anything is better than nothing added to the load. Will order again."
5.00,"I really love how these get my dogs' blankets and my husband's gym clothes so much fresher. So glad I found them."
2.00,"The packets had a strong scent that we didn't love at all. In fact they are still in my laundry room, not being used months later. :("
1.00,"i will only use this for towels or bath rugs...ewww they do NOT smell pleasent. after getting a damaged package originally i was sent a new one and couldn't wait as i love tide products. i figured what the heck, i will use this for my husband so he doesn't have to smell girly....but my goodness it smells horribly! can't even describe it! will not be buying this anymore."
5.00,"I have a 13yr old and 9 yr old boy, not to mention my husband! I love this sport detergent. It makes my kids clothes smell great instead of like they just got done playing basketball or baseball. My only problem is everywhere doesn't carry it so I pretty much buy out the one store in town that does! My kids even noticed I changed from the regular HE tide to this sport one!!"
5.00,"I LOVE Tide plus Febreze! My clothes, linen, bedsheets, towels, etc keep that fresh scent for several days. I catch myself smelling my clothes and thinking, \"Wow, this product works well!\" Thanks for making a wonderful product!!!"
5.00,"I have these on a subscription to be shipped every 45 days. I can't find this in my local stores. They work on getting the smell out of workout clothes. I have also used these when I do towels and whites. They are the best."
5.00,"Tide with Febreze Freshness smells wonderful from start to finish. Our towels smell beautiful, the blankets smell fresh and clean, and our pajamas are so very snuggly with the soft, sweet smell.I love the Bounce with Febreze as well."
5.00,"It's laundry detergent. What do you expect, it gets my clothes clean and smells nice. I buy liquid fabric softener and dryer sheets in the same sent. It's great!"
5.00,"These in the wash packets are just the ticket for laundry. Sure helps to keep the laundry stains out & so easy to use."
5.00,"I have an 8 year old who plays soccer and it has been particularly rainy lately. His soccer field was a complete swamp and they played anyway. When he got off the field, my husband undressed him at the car and threw his muddy clothes in the trunk. When I got home and went to wash them, I just groaned thinking they would never come clean. One wash later, you cannot even tell they had been soaked in mud...not one spot or stain remained! I wish there was a place to post the before and after pictures!! I am so completely impressed with this Tide...oh and it smells great (spring & renewal)!"
4.00,"I didnt research before I bought this. This is an awesome product with my son's football gear however the 100oz is the same price at my local Target & Walmart. Amazon dosent price guarentee on anything but TV's That will teach me not to check things out before getting it here."
5.00,"I have a family of 6 people and we are on a military budget, however I always make sure to put Tide in my budget. I have been using Tide products for 14yrs now and it is the only product that I will use to wash and dry my family clothes with. It gives a freshness and softness to the clothes that cannot be compared to other product. I would like to thank you all for this products and tell you all to keep up the good work."
5.00,"I love Tide with Febreze. It cleans great and makes the laundry smell wonderful! You don't have to use as much to get your clothes clean so it really doesn't end up costing more than the bargain laundry deterents in the long run."
3.00,"DIDN'T NOTICE MUCH OF A DIFFERENCE WHEN ADDED TO LAUNDRY WITH OTHER DETERGENTS. NOT AT COMPARABLE TO THEIR TIDE SPORT DETERGENT"
4.00,"~For the last week I have done many loads of dirty laundry using Tide Ultra with Febreze and all of the laundry spilling out of my dryer has resulted in clean and bright laundry that smells great! There is a lot of dirty stuff going in and coming out of our washer and dryer daily, everything from dress shirts, to towels and bedding, to jeans and we use all of the washer's settings (delicate and regular cycles in all water temperatures). The end result has been consistent while using this detergent.The only problem that I have is the cost. When compared to the big tub of detergent I normally purchase from a warehouse type store, this soap is quite costly (about double the price). The big tub of detergent also gets my laundry clean, bright, and smelling terrific, so although this is a fine product, it will not make its way onto my grocery list."
5.00,"I will never have to double up on laundry detergent or rewash my husbands grimy work clothes twice to get out the funk! This product does more than that! It even got all the animal hair from my wool coat & blankets in one wash! Of course I also combined one cap of the liquid boost as well because I am one who had learned it's better to be safe than sorry so I tend to add extras. Anyway, even with cheapy laundry detergent it worked so well! I am now a loyal user! And the smell of fresh laundry doesn't fade quickly! Even after my stinking hubby came home from work I could still smell that sweet fresh scent on his clothes. Now that is what I call awesome indeed!"
5.00,"I have been using this stuff for about 6 months now and I have no complaints. I don't have exercise clothes to wash but I do have 4 children that I wash for on a daily basis and this does the trick. If I don't use Downy w/ it my kids say it has a Jolly Rancher smell. It combines nicely w/ the Downy scents we use. As far as the smell others are saying they smell I must be missing it. It removes my children's sweat and dirt stains in one wash which is awesome."
5.00,"It was nice receiving the laundry detergent, fabric softener, fabric refresher all together."
5.00,"I usually stay away from trying new detergents because of sensitive skin issues in our family, but bought Tide Spring Renewal when my store was out of the original Tide detergent. That was a couple months ago and I won't buy anything else now. Everytime my husband does his laundry he comments about how much he loves the smell of this and he is an auto body mechanic and has commented how he loves that he can still smell the fresh scent in his clothes at the end of his work day. For him to gush about a laundry detergent the way he has...it must be good! Tide - NEVER change or discontinue this formula...it is PERFECT!"
5.00,"I have been waiting for this formula to come out since I saw it for the \"regular\" washers. I usually get a \"sour\" smell from my cold water formula but since my first load with febreze sport I love doing laundry again."
5.00,"I used to be a Tide devotee.  Back when I followed my mother's advice.  Then I decided I really didn't need to spend that much money to get my clothes clean so I started using a cheaper detergent.  Well, the mask has been removed from my eyes: Tide IS better.  I washed one load of whites with my old detergent and then washed another load of whites in Tide Ultra with Febreze.  I didn't use any special stain removers or bleach.  The load washed in my old detergent was fairly clean.  But there was still a faint ring around my husband's white shirt's collar.  You know how hard it can be to get collars thoroughly clean.  The Tide got it spotlessly clean!  I'm sold.  It might cost a bit more, but it's worth it.  Mother knows best afterall.  But don't tell her I said that!"
4.00,"I usually use Gain because I like the aroma left on my clothes. But for the Vine program I decided to try Tide Ultra with Febreze Freshness Spring and Renewal Scent Powder. It's probably been over 15 years since I tried Tide. I really like how this cleaned my clothes. I first tried it on a load of towels, which sometimes have a slight sour odor. While I didn't smell a strong floral odor like some have mentioned, I did feel like the towels smelled fresh and clean. I am satisfied with it on my clothes.                                                                     I like the idea of Febreze added into the powder. I think Tide has come out with a great product and I would recommend."
5.00,"Gets better with each load! I have used Tide all my life and it just gets better and better!"
5.00,"This is my favorite detergent for washing my family's clothes. Everyone is satisfied and I love having towels that smell good. Somehow, it starts the day nicely!"
3.00,"does not dissolve in cold water, sticks to laundry. yet useful for warm and hot loads. will give a try to other products"
5.00,"I got a free sample of this product. It worked on some pretty tough food stains that occured during a messy cooking marathon session at the house. The towels came out stain free, even the spaghetti sauce stains."
5.00,"smells so good!! i love this product in any scent but i feel this one just smells better and since its sports i feel like it works better for stains as well!"
1.00,"I always buy TIDE and have never complained but I just bought the Febreze Tide because I thought I would enjoy a fresh clean smell but after pulling the clothes out of the dryer there was an overwhelming odor of mildew and after several loads which continued to smell of mildew and dirty feet...I refuse to use it again. I will not recommend to anyone and suggest STRONGLY that you either discontinue the Febreze Tide or find a way to fix it."
5.00,"Very little needs 2 be used 2 get your clothes clean. The scent of febreze still linger after a wash. Works wonders on my husbands socks."
5.00,"Smells great & works well. :-)"
5.00,"I love febreeze and use it faithfully everyday and now you put my favorite scent of febreeze in my laundry detergent and I LOVE IT. Tide is the ONLY detergent I use and will EVER use. :)Thanks for putting my 2 favorite items together in ONE :)"
1.00,"I honestly think this product works only by suppressing smelly odors rather than cleaning them away. I would honestly rather smell sweat when I run than to smell like I've dumped a bottle of perfume over my head. To add insult to odorific injury, my clothes smell like perfume AND sweat - this stuff just doesn't clean bad odors out. If I'm going to pay this much for sports detergent, I might as well switch to a better brand that doesn't just hide bad smells. And to give you context, I actually like the smell of normal Febreze and have used it frequently."
1.00,"This awful scent just doesn't rinse out!!! At first I thought my housecleaner was using some new, vile product, but it turned out that everything that went through a load of wash with the Tide Febreze Sport Scent detergent was impregnated with an odor that carried all through the house - into whatever room those unlucky laundry items traveled. I cannot conceive of anyone liking it!"
1.00,"If Amazon would let me give a product negative stars, I would do it in a heartbeat for this crummy product. I picked up a pack of these out of curiosity. I have used them a total of 3 times now. Each and every time they have left streaks of white residue on my clothes. I've tried doing a smaller load, warm water, cold water, anything that I thought might make these things actually perform their function, but no. How Tide can release a product that actually does the exact opposite of it's intended purpose is beyond me. The only thing these packets are boosting is the number of stains in my clothes. Unbelievable."
1.00,"The reviews here are not making this up. This product cleans clothes but mask orders IMO (in my opinon). You can faintly smell the oder left behind in the clothes and an overwhelming perfume floral perfume scent. Very gross when you are in a cycling class with many other orders and you smell like \"funky carnations\". I am off to try sports-wash. I will keep you posted."
2.00,"While I like both Febreze Tide products that are offered, I miss the 'Citrus and Light' scent. I realize that companies have to trim down products that don't sell very well, but at least at the laundromat I use, there are many, many upset people because of the discontinuation of this product. I would be very happy if you brought 'Citrus and Light' back to the market. If you introduce a product, consider the people who have already 'adapted' the product into their lives before yanking it from the market.Thank You"
5.00,"My husband runs marathons (I know) and his workout clothes are foul on long run days. I tried everything and the \"special laundry soap\" sold by boutique marathon stores sells for an arm and a leg, no pun intended. I tried this once and that is all it took! I now use one in every load (towels, sheets...all smells divine) and have it on my recurring \"ship and save\" so I do not have to hunt through the stores to find it."
2.00,"Just a personal preference, but I don't like the scent of this version of Tide HE. I've given it a fair chance, but I really just can't tolerate it. Typically, I like \"sporty\" scented products, but this one just doesn't smell nice."
4.00,"I ordered this because it was the only laundry detergent with even a hint of breast meat on the package. Much to my surprise (and pleasure obviously), these actually smell like EXACTLY like VICTORY. Just like they say they do. Here's to the good people at Tide! Thanks for finally letting everyone else share in the lovely scent of winning."
5.00,"I have been a Gain junkee for years and recently came across these little tablets and thought I'd give them a try. I'm hooked. I swear my laundry smells like it's been hanging out in the fresh air when it comes out of the dryer. Just throw one in the washer (and they work with a front load washer) and that's it!! Love 'em!!"
1.00,"Warning: The smell left on my clothes from this detergent is almost unbearable. It seems to \"adhere\" particulary well to spandex-type materials and stretchy fabrics for some reason. BEWARE! I am not someone who is typically sensitive to many smells and this stuff makes me nauseous. I am so sad that I have so much laundry to re-wash, now, in regular detergent..."
5.00,"I love this detergent. It is the best detergent I have used to get the stains and smells out of work and sports cloths. I do have difficulty finding it though, so when I find it I buy several."
5.00,"Tide is the cleanest most reliable product on the detergent line ups. LOVE it and always pick it over any other other brand."
5.00,"Tide powder detergent is my favorite laundry detergent.  My favorite scent is Tide with Bleach Orginial Scent.  It leaves a nice soap scent on clothes, besides always getting them super clean.  But I thought I'd try this Tide with Febreze, and hoped it wouldn't have too strong a scent.  It doesn't.  When I opened the box, I did not get a bad headache, as often happens with strongly scented detergent.  There also is no lingering scent on the clothes after they are dried.  There might be a light scent, but not strong enough for you to identify the type of Tide that was used.  Also, as always with Tide, the clothes come out clean, white and bright."
5.00,"You need a special detergent to remove odors and sweat from synthetic material work-out clothes: those same \"moisture-wicking\" fabrics on your workout tops and pants are also incredible at retaining odors and sweat even after a normal wash and dry cycle, and those odor particles are released the next time that those clothes become wet. I really liked the performance of these Tide Booster pods: they are incredibly strong scented, and I think the scent is very pleasant. They removed all the baked-in smells from my Hot Yoga clothes and towel mats. Note that these are not replacement detergent pods: they are meant to be added to your wash cycle on top of regular detergent. I imagine if you're a hardcore aerobic exerciser (cyclist, marathon runner, hot yoga practitioner), you'll need something like this as part of your laundry arsenal."
4.00,"Seems to work very well. I will continue to use it. Works great on white clothing...my work shirts..Give it a try."
5.00,"I have tried them all, even in the old top loaders and now the new front loaders. I do have to say the Tide with Febreeze Spring & Renewal dowa not compare to any other types or brands as far and how well it cleans you laundry and how great your laundry feels and smells after being washed using Tide with Febreeze Spring and Renewal. The problem I have is I cannot find the Tide with Febreeze Spring and Renew in the large bottles that are HE, I know you make it because I found it in a 26 load bottle. I need to get this in a 78 load size bottle or more. Please let me know where I can get the large bottle somewhere near me. I live in zip code 77090."

5.00,"OK, I'll admit it - I toss my sweaty towels and gym clothes in the hamper nice and damp, and only wash them when the hamper is full.  Usually the stuff on the bottom is still damp over a week later. Add in dirty socks and my typical wardrobe of shorts and T's in the summer, and there's a not so pleasant aroma emanating from the closet. Usually I put the washer on \"super wash\" and turn on the extra rinse cycle.                                                                     Now I'm washing my clothes on the regular cycle and skipping the extra rinse.  Plus the clothes don't come out smelling \"flowery\" - just clean. Plus I'm lazy. Whites, blacks, grays - all in the same load. No complaints.                                                                     It's a no-brainer for guys. Dump in smelly, dirty clothes. Add soap and water, wash, dry. Result: Un-smelly, clean clothes."
4.00,"My only complaint is that the Sport HE liquid is thicker than the regular Tide HE liquid. Some gets left in the detergent cup every time. It doesn't \"thin\" easily either as it is heavier and thicker than water."
5.00,"For the record, I am not one to write reviews on any product, but I felt compelled to voice my opinion about Tide."
5.00,"As a female, city letter carrier, it is important to stay \"so fresh and so clean clean\". Thanks Tide for keeping me clean and smelling like a Lady."
5.00,"I think that the people who gave reviews stating it was too strong of an aroma probably don't like most scented detergents in general. I am a designer living in Manhattan who uses this to pre-wash certain apparel items before I silkscreen them for clients. It leaves no doubt in my clients' minds that the apparel has, in fact, been pre-washed, as it smells fresh like Downy or something. It's a gender neutral scent. I like to use it for my own sports bras, towels, and hoodies, as it retains that just-washed aroma that is nice sometimes. It's double the price of \"All\" and other scented detergents, but it definitely has an aroma that lasts and you won't need to use any fabric softeners or dryer sheets. If I want my sheets to not have aroma, I just use BioKleen organic detergent that, once dried, has little aroma at all."
4.00,"This detergent smells great!  The scent is a light and fresh one.  It doesn't really have distinct notes, just a generally fresh scent.  I could smell it while my washer was running, which I love, and it left a faint fresh scent on my clothes, which I also appreciate.  My clothes came out nice and clean.  My only reservation is that the box of powdered detergent is still bulkier and more awkward than liquid detergent.  Though this concentrated formula means a smaller box, it still requires more storage space and is more difficult to carry around than a liquid.  This isn't a huge issue for me now, when my washer is right in my kitchen, but when I lived in an apartment with a laundry room down several flights of stairs, that would have definitely been an issue.  I would buy this detergent in liquid format, but the box of powder is bulky."
5.00,"Use this to get rid of the smelly odors from Dri-Fit work-out clothing for the entire family. Comes out smelling great."
4.00,"My wife uses these on when washing some of my older T shirts. Sometimes they get a little \"funky\" smelling and using one of these with the wash takes that smell right out. Using just a good fabric softener wouldn't get the smell out but one of these + the fabric softener worked great. They aren't cheap but they do work."
5.00,"From my earliest memories of helping my mom with laundry, Tide was the only detergent in our home.  My mom continues to use it religiously and swears Tide is the only detergent that will get the grease out of my dads clothes (mechanic grease).  I don't have to deal with greasy laundry but teens can get into some pretty dirty, smelly stuff on a daily basis.                                              I've been using Tide Ultra Febreze Freshness Spring Renewal Scent for almost a month now, usually one load or more per day.  You use 1/3 less than regular tide and it still gets your clothes just as clean.  The Spring Renewal Scent is light and pleasant (not overpowering) and the fragrance remains in your clothes for quite some time.  I just removed an item of clothing from a dresser that had been washed with Tide Ultra Febreze Freshness April 29 and it still has the refreshing scent (22 days later).                                              I can't say that I use Tide exclusively.  I can tell you Tide does what a detergent is supposed to do....cleans and leaves clothes smelling fresh.                                                                     UPDATE:  Now I'm A Believer!                                              I completely understand why my Mom only uses Tide.  My son is a welder in a fabrication shop and always has this funky smell in his work clothes along with dark dingy places (very noticeable). He dropped by last week and the smell was so loud it lingered in every room he walked in.  I mentioned that I didn't know how he could get used to that smell.  He said he had tried but not found any detergent to get the smell out of his clothes.  I suggested he leave his welding shirt with me and let me try to clean it.  All odors and stains were removed after washing with Tide Ultra with Febreze.  He was so impressed he brought me two work shirts and two pair of pants to clean.  After starting the washer I came back and checked and the water was a dark dingy gray.  The clothes came out of the washer with no odors and all stains gone.  My son said this is the first detergent to remove all work odors and stains from his clothes.  Now I know not all detergents are the same."
5.00,"The only complaint I have is I wished the line in the measuring cap was a different color so it was easier to see."
5.00,"I think it's the best detergent I've ever used w/ the Febreeze in it (and April fresh Downy, lol) EVERYONE loves how my clothes & bedding smell."
5.00,"As a mama to six children (5 of them BOYS), I was thrilled to find this particular type of Tide detergent. It takes out the stains and has the BEST scent EVER, of any detergent! This will be my go-to laundry detergent from now ON!"
1.00,"This laundry soap is an unrelenting assault on the senses. The smell is horrible and doesn't seem to dissipate. The soap leaves an almost greasy coating on the laundry which seems to transfer the scent (quite easily I might add) to your skin. I can't put my hand anywhere near my face after touching clothes, blankets or towels that have been washed in it without having a powerful perfumey smell go straight up my nostrils. It's everywhere. It's disgusting. My eyes and skin are itchy and it makes me gag."
5.00,"The febreze compliments the cleaning power of Tide. It not only makes my clothes smell wonderful but it leaves my front-loading washing machine spring fresh. I wouldn't use any other product."
5.00,"Smells nice and fresh scent, got totally rid of that stinky socks smell from my son's whites. Am hoping to have a chance to try it on some damp, musty smelling beach towels to see how it works on those, but the opportunity hasn't arisen yet."
5.00,"I am auto delivery with this Tide and I am so glad I got this deal. Tide is the best clothes detergent you can get in my opinion, your clothes will be so clean and they come out smelling so good. I was buying this at the big warehouse club store and this offer was a steal, so give it a try I think you will be pleased."
5.00,"It was just as advertised. it was in one piece and not leaking, I'd call that great shipping. It arrived on time. I would recommend this product to anyone. Whats not to like; it Tide and Fabreze."
5.00,"So, would buy Tide again but only directly from the store on site. Hope this helps : )"
4.00,"Works great in our HE machine. We used less than the recommended amount,so more than 30 loads. The scent was just OK. Subscribe & Save is a great program!"
5.00,"This is the only scent that leaves my clothes smelling fresh and clean. I have a hard working husband and many of his clothes seems like they should be thrown away. I have tried everything this is the only brand and scent that has a fresh smell and I use much less. Try it I wish all of Tides scents were this powerful."
5.00,"I have used almost everyone of Tide's laundry products and I am sold.......My Mother used Tide and I won't use anything else, my children use it too. It makes my laundry smell clean and fresh, everytime."
5.00,"I've read hundreds of product reviews for various items but have never written one. After using this product, I was obligated to write my first one. I switched to this product from a leading competitor that I have been using for years after a recent visit to a friend's house. My friend's linens smelled so clean and wonderful -- she said she used Tide. I bought this product and have been thoroughly pleased with the fresh fragrance it gives my clothes. Not only does this product make my clothes smell heavenly, but it has restored the whiteness of my husband's t-shirts. I haven't seen his shirts look so white since the day they came out of the package! Awesome product! Job well done, Tide!!"
5.00,"BOOM! Tide Plus Febreze Freshness (my favorite scent)'s in the (laundry) room. And when Tide Plus Febreze Freshness is in the room, a great laundry-day experience can happen! LOVE that lavender cap, too! BOOM!"
1.00,"I bought this specifically because of reviews that said this detergent actually removes bad smell. Some of our bath towels had funny smell after washing them with dish towel. Normal Tide wasn't removing the smell. So I researched and found this one. Not only does this not remove the smell, it amplied the bad smell in the towel. yack."
5.00,"I love Tide Sport! My only complaint is the price, and now they are selling a smaller bottle (75oz) for the same price as the 100oz at Target stores. I switched to Gain Tropical Sensations. Gain TS smelled great going into the washing machine, but completely lost the smell coming out. I love the Tide Sport scent, and love that it lasts, even out of the dryer. I will pay more for Tide Sport...but not at Amazon.com. Target is still much cheaper than Amazon.com's best price."
2.00,"The product is a good one, used it before and like it. Cleans the clothing very well and the scent isn't too bad. The price was okay, only a dollar or 2 cheaper than buying in the store. But, the shipping is HORRIBLE! I ordered June 10, didn't ship until June 15, and as of June 21, still not here. I live in Nashville, ordered a few things at the same time. Even an office chair from LA got here faster than this soap. Had I known it would have taken so long to get it, I would have paid the extra couple bucks and bought it at the local store!"
5.00,"This is the first detergent that actually absorbs the Oder from the dry fit clothes. My son only wears dry fit clothes and is very active. Please do not do away with Tide Febreze. This has been a wonderful product to use for the laundry! Thank you."
5.00,"My family loves the Tide with the lavendar scent, or as we call it, \"Tide with the purple cap\". We wouldn't use anything else. One time wea friend recommended a brand that was a couple dollars cheaper. She said it worked just as well as Tide, so I tried it to see. IT WASN'T EVEN CLOSE! My husband noticed the minute his clothes came out of the dryer. The scent wasn't the only thing that was wrong. His clothes still had stains on them. He's a forest ranger and he can get clothes pretty dirty. Tide gets it out the first time, every time. Besides its strength, the scent keeps the bedroom linens smelling nice all week. I gave my bargain brand to the person who recommended it and got my Tide back. We won't ever go back to anything else!"
5.00,"i love this product i refuse to use anything but this to wash my clothes. it also leaves a nice scent on my clothes without being too much or overpowering. this is good cause im allergic to some scents or my allergies are trigger if the scent it really strong.i love this and would recommend it to anyone its amazing :]"
5.00,"I had used other detergents for years and added frebreeze to my laundry, but when Tide with Frebreeze came out all that changed. I have been using Tide with Frebreeze since it's release and we have always had people tell us how clean and fresh our clothes (including my oldest son's sweaty gym clothes) smell when we first arrive somewhere. We have friends remark that items washed in your detergent smell like they just come out of the dryer, I haven't the heart to tell them they were wash in some cases weeks ago. No matter where I work on my sales route and what kinds of smells get embedded in my clothes(smoke mostly), I know one wash with Tide with Frebreeze will get it out and make everything smell fresh for a long time.Thanks for make fresh clean laundry easy to achieve."
5.00,"I have grew up seeing my mother using Tide and have continued to use it in my adult years. Your clothes smell so fresh and when you open the drawers or closet, it is like you just took them out of the dryer. My only thing is that I fell in love with Tide with Febreze scent Meadows and Rain. I guess they took it off the market but Spring Renewal is a great substitute. I wouldn't change detergents for anything. Thank you the many years of freshness."
5.00,"Even though I am not \"sport active\", I do feel this laundry detergent does an excellent job keeping freshness. I use it with Snuggle Green Burst Softener for the best clean fresh smell ever!!!"
5.00,"TIDE he with Febreeze Sport is now my FAVORITE laundry detergent! I was a GAIN user for years, and have been converted! I'm not super crazy about the higher price, but it's worth it since I only have to wash those stinky clothes ONCE and not repeatedly to get the stink out!With a grubby hubby, a stinky teen and potty pants little ones, TIDE sport gets ALL the odors out with just one wash!I really miss their Deep Clean fragrance (that peppery smell was my favorite) and would love it if you could bring it back!Thanks TIDE, for your wonderful product!"
1.00,"I would give it negative 5 stares if I could. All of Tide's products with \"actilift\" make your clothing smell old, dank and just plain funky. I cannot believe they are unaware of this. I used several versions (boost tablets, liquid etc) and all of them do the same thing to my laundry and, worse, to the inside of my HE machine. I really hate to say it but it feels like this is on purpose to sell the laundry machine cleaners. I clean mine regularly but whenever I used a tide product that stinky, cloying smell would come back (sort of like rotten tomatoes and dirt mixed with sweat...really gross!) Until I figured it out I was washing my machine weekly. Then I switched products because something was on sale, and voila! All my laundry smelled normal. To test if it was indeed Tide I went back to the remaining product I had left and after one washing it smelled like above. Having a hard me believing this, I tested it over a month long period. My findings were pretty clear: Tide makes some clothing (especially cottons and natural fabrics) retain horrible odors. Synthetic fabrics actually smell like the product. So if you only wear synthetic yoga pants, this is the detergent for you. Natural fibers? No way! I'm surprised Tide hasn't made more of an effort to fix this. Maybe it's only an HE/front loading machine thing?"
5.00,"Thank you for developing this product. I LOVE IT!"
5.00,"We picked up the Tide with Febreze this week! We love it! What a wonderful combination: Tide & Febreze!!! Thank you for this option! And thank you for the kindness that you've shown to disaster victims by sponsoring the Tide LOADS OF HOPE! We're honored to use products that in turn help others!Sincerely,The Potter Family"
3.00,"I thought I'd splurge and buy some Tide. I do a lot of laundry and since Tide is the most expensive on the market, I don't buy it often. I was very disappointed in the results. Not sure if I'm allowed to say this, but Era Plus works so much better at getting stains out. No, don't work for Era (whoever makes it?) I just know my laundry."
5.00,"Tide has been recommended by my washer maker and I have used it for two years in my front-load washer. This Tide Ultra is wonderful with the new Febreze scent as I remove the cleanest clothes to toss into the dryer and as I remove the ultra clean clothes from the dryer smelling sooooo very good. My family is often caught sniffing the clean laundry like a tv commerical in the laundry room...GO TIDE!!"
4.00,"Smells great, very much like Febreeze.  I have been using Tide for over 30 years and have never been disappointed.  I wanted to try this one to see if I would like the new scent.  The clothes smell like Febreeze after the wash, but I would have to use an unscented fabric softener for it to make it through the drying process.  My Bounce still overpowers the scent from the wash."
5.00,"I don't ordinarily use Tide although I know it is a superior product; the price tags of other detergents are more attractive.  Also I usually use liquid detergent so that my asthma will not be bothered by the powder.  In this case I decided to take a flyer on this Tide product.  The smell is very nice and so far the powder hasn't made me ill so that is a good thing.                                                                     One other thing has made Tide unattractive to me.  I think it gets clothes too clean and wears them down faster and takes the colors out of them.  So far in this testing that has not happened.                                                                     The powder has not clumped or wound up stuck in the fabrics.  It gets my clothes clean and I don't worry if I miss the fabric softener cycle.  I have an old machine so I have to work with it.  The clothes come out of the dryer fresh-smelling and not overwhelmingly scented.  If I get a newer machine, I will go to the Tide.  I really like the smell of it and it cleans well."
5.00,"Its Tide and Febreze... as you move about through out the day, the freshness seeps out. Great for active wear, when you sweat... you smell sweet!"
1.00,"If you enjoy blueish spots and georaphic blueish stains on your clothes, then be my guest and buy this stuff. Unfortunately, I did not try this product for over 30 days after its arrival, waiting to run out of my current stock of detergent. Now I am stuck with several bottles of this clothes stainer. Argrgh!!!!!"
1.00,"Bought this detergent yesterday. Did five loads of laundry today.....all of them smell like cat urine. Now I'm stuck with a large amount of this liquid that I won't be using again!"
5.00,"The Best @ Washing"
5.00,"With two boys playing competitive sports I was having a difficult time getting their sports clothes clean and smelling good. The fabrics of their sports clothes need delicate type soaps and gentle wash cycles but couldn't really get things clean or smelling nice. Now add one of these pods to their laundry and everything comes out clean without that funky sport smell!"
5.00,"I grew up with my mom using Tide and the scent always reminded me of childhood and home.I began using Febreze in my husband's loads of uniforms as soon as it was on the market.To now have both available in one liquid is time and money saving.My husband has passed away but washing my clothes and bedding in Tide with Febreze makes it seem he is hugging me all the time!"
2.00,"When we first started using this product, we were very pleased with the deodorizing action of the detergent in our work clothes. We work in construction and farming, and other detergents alone would not always remove the sour sweat smell from some \"sweat in all day\" articles of clothing. Initially, I had great results with removing the odors and ordinary soil from our worst work clothes. Now that I've used a 100 oz bottle, several articles of clothing have developed a seriously foul odor in sweaty areas. Even the additives I previously used are not removing these odors now. I will discontinue using this product and return it to the store, going back to by Clean Breeze scent Tide that served me well before now. Hopefully, it can wash out whatever effect this Sport formula has left in my clothes."
4.00,"I really like the scent of this detergent and it works well for getting light- and medium- tough stains out on its own. Only thing: it does nothing for wrinkles, you need a fabric softener or dryer sheets for that."
2.00,"I am an avid Tide Pod regular and Boost, Downy Liquid and Unstoppables and Drier sheets user. I love the way it makes everything smell. Pretty much everything you can use for Laundry from Proctor and Gamble as long as they are Tide and Downy products. I ordered this instead of my usual Boost Pods. I use the Orange Boost along with my Tide Pods for my colors and the Vivid Boost White and Bright Pods for my Whites.... I thought i would try something different. The smell of these are horrendous and that's putting it lightly. They may work well, which is why i gave it an extra star instead of 1... But i just couldn't stand the smell. It was THAT BAD! If it wouldn't have had a seal to close the pouch i would've had to put it outside! I use Febreze all the time as well, so i don't understand why the smell was so bad?? This would be bad for those that have sensitivities to smells, as do i. It was instant headache for me. Oh and to amend my above comment, i gave some to my brother to try and he hated the smell as well. I did try one pod and rewashed the load of clothes to get the smell out."
2.00,"I always use Tide for laundry, but the smell of the Tide plus Febreze Freshness. is overwhelming. If you exercise and sweat while wearing these clothes the smell will gag you. I have had to dilute this detergent to use it."
3.00,"Tide has alway been a Liquid Laundry Deterget I trust to clean my family's cloth and now Febreze added our cloth will smell Freeher."
4.00,"Stains on clothes at our house is a common thing with small children. I love to pop these in the wash. They are very effective at getting all kinds of stains out."
4.00,"Soap is soap, at least that's the way I usually look at it.                                                                     On the other hand, my wife washed an old jacket of mine in this product and I have to say, even I noticed.  I can't specifically say that this product cleaned any better than something else ( I wouldn't actually call myself an expert of soap suds), but I can say that I specifically noticed that my jacket seemed softer and certainly smelled good.  A stain I had on the inside dissolved quite nicely so now my jacket is clean and smells good.                                                                     My wife thinks that it might even be cheaper to use since she may not end up buying fabric softner... sounds good to me."
5.00,"Who new that when I got married I would really be married to the washing machine? Because of Tide with Fabreeze that's 1 affair my husband is happy about. Using Tide with Fabreeze makes not only makes everything I wash smell like it was line dried in the fresh air(which we don't have much of in Brentwood- (I live 2 blocks from a White Castle), But it makes doing laundry a BREEZE. Using Tide I never have to worry about my laundry coming out clean but now I even stopped using fabric softener. I don't use my drier for much because I don't believe in frying to a crisp. Using Tide with Fabreeze I can smell the freshness as soon as I open the washing machine. Even my husband noticed when I had clothes drying on hangers he said,\"what smells so good, did you get a new candle(only burn fabreeze)?\" I told him, \"no babe that's the laundry on the hangers in the bathroom.\" It literally permeates the whole 2800sqft house we have. We love it. I love how Tide cleans my laundry & adding Fabreeze to it makes everything smell better than ever. It was funny when I had asked him if his sweat shirt needed to be washed, he smelled it & said yea it doesn't smell like Fabreeze anymore. I used to have to wait til he wasn't looking or sleeping to wash his favorite sweats, shorts, hat etc. Now he hands them over willingly because they don't have that fabreeze freshness anymore as he puts it. In my opinion Tide made the clothes smell fresh & clean anyway, but by adding Fabreeze to it the product got better. Thank you for saving me time(no more fabric softener) & for making my life easier by not having to cop my husbands favorite things to wash them. Because I don't use the drier & I hang most everything on hangers to dry I am also freshening up my house @ the sametime- everytime I do laundry (which is constantly).Thanks again to Tide & P&G for taking a great product & making it even better. There's somethng to be said for being brand& product loyal. My only complaint is the pricing- it is kind of on the high side. But I guess like the saying goes, \"you get what you pay for.\"Right? As far as cleanliness & freshness I don't have any complaints what so ever. I couldn't ask for a better product."
5.00,"There's a reason Tide products cost more than some other detergents.  They actually perform as advertised and get clothes cleaner.  Tide Ultra with Febreze is a big box of powdered detergent or granules that dissolve easily and completely in cool or warm water [or hot, though who uses \"hot\" these days?], as it should, and which cleans with one wash, in cool or warm water [or hot],  as it should.  This product removes, without pre-treating, grease spots on clothes, coffee, tea, and other gruesome stains from kitchen towels and dishcloths, and, with the addition of Febreze, gets the funky smell out of bathtowels and washclothes.  It meets the challenge of dirty jeans and workclothes, as well.  It's an all around, robust detergent that works!  If you can consider washing a pleasure, it's a pleasure to open the washer and find clothes that don't have to go back into the \"to be washed again\" pile!  And, whoever thought of adding Febreze is a genius.  I recommend Ultra Tide with Febreze without reservation."
1.00,"I am a runner and have several favorite items I wear again and again. They started smelling sweaty even after a washing so I decided to spring for the new Tide Sport. Bad idea!! It doesn't leave a perfume smell, it leaves a \"oops I forgot to put the washed clothes in the dryer yesterday\", kinda smell. You know that smell of a towel that was left sitting in the washer for a day before it went in the dryer? Kinda wet doggish. I will never buy this again."
3.00,"I thought I'd splurge and buy some Tide. I do a lot of laundry and since Tide is the most expensive on the market, I don't buy it often. I was very disappointed in the results. Not sure if I'm allowed to say this, but Era Plus works so much better at getting stains out."
5.00,"My daughter and I are both very particular about the scents we use. We'll spend 20 minutes trying out different things to find a good one. This one is very good. Our only complaint is that we have an HE washer and we have trouble finding this scent in stock in the HE on a regular basis. Wish we could count on finding it more often."
5.00,"I am very sensitive to perfumes but this scent is fabulous! Having the febreze in the soap is a great idea."
1.00,"I had a horrific allergic reaction to Tide sport with febreeze. The odd thing about this reaction is that it consists of itchy, red papules or bumps that look like insect bites. I suffered for about a week before I realized it was the detergent."
5.00,"This is the best smelling detergent I've ever used! Please keep it on the market forever!"
5.00,"I hate doing laundry. However, the fresh scent of Tide with Febreze make it a little more enjoyable. I love the way the clothes and towels smell when I am folding them. It helps me to finish the task. My husband works in construction and when he come home after a long day his clothes still smell a little fresh. I hope that you try it. I am hooked."
2.00,"Thank You"
5.00,"I love this product! I have three athletic teenagers and their sports clothes come home smelling awful...this scent takes it away...I don't know why people are complaining, I like the smell...and it also cleans well."
5.00,"In our house we have a little bit of a problem.  For some reason, deeply rooted in my troubled childhood, I have a case of food dropsy.  My clothes are the recipient of frequent food stains that are difficult to remove, and in the past the process of removing them ruined my clothes in the process.  I have tried every detergent under the sun to address this problem, with limited success.  This purchase was just another in a long list of experiments that I fully expected to fail.                                                                     Was I surprised!  From the moment she started using this my wife insisted that I write a review here to let everyone know how good this product really is.  While the fragrance is nice, good smelling stained clothes really don't excite me.  My wife has informed me that this works well in all settings, in all temperatures, and most importantly eliminates stains.  This is not just a good product, but for the stain prone like myself it is a lifesaver!"
5.00,"I never use anything but Tide detergent, and I used to add Clorox 2 to whiten and brighten. But now that I've discovered Tide Boost, it's all I will use. It just works great!"
5.00,"We drop one of these pods in with the really stinky work clothes from the farm. Everything comes out fresh and clean smelling. Thank goodness they are readily available on amazon!"
5.00,"Cleans well, smells great and do not need to use much to get clothes clean."
5.00,"I love the clean fresh scent that Febreze leaves in my clean clothes. My grandmother, my mother, myself and my child are all tide users. We are a 4th generation tide family. I NEVER USE ANYTHING ELSE! LOVE IT"
5.00,"These Pods (can be used in regular washers as well) for HE (High Efficiency) Washers is the perfect dosage; even though it is scented, it is very lightly scented; but those most \"STINKIEST\" garments of pure sweat from Stinky University from working out to working outdoors to the most sweatiest person; it can handle YOU ... yet is gentle enough for all garments and fabrics! Originally, my order was for the bottles but somehow something went wrong so I wound up getting these Pods - the BEST THING EVER because it has the perfect amount of soap which I am allergic to soap; hence why I have to use fabric softener is mainly because to get rid of the soap residue off of the fabric ... here, I don't have to use so much fabric softener anymore. YEAH! These Pods are perfect - even for people who have soap allergies like myself; yet, we need clean clothes! A TRUE VICTORY FROM TIDE! Going BEYOND - I love the fact that one POD - I can wash all those fragile expensive Cycling Gear (touring / racing) which are very costly and must be handled with care (but never put into the dryer); and TIDE's VICTORY BOOST SCENT UNIT does its job. As unreal as it sounds, even as cycling on my Trek along with other Cyclist; people in motor vehicles are unruly - throwing trash to ciggies to bottles at us; even yelling and cursing at us. Cyclist has the right to use the Roads as much as they do and we comply and adhere to the Laws of the Roads and we use the Bike Lanes; Respect us just as much as we Respect You! I cannot EXPOUND HOW MUCH THIS TIDE HE FEBREZE SPORT VICTORY BOOST SCENT UNIT DOSE IN-WASH BOOSTER HAS REMOVED: 1) Either a partial Hamburger of something? Off my Cycling shorts and shirts 2) Old Stains that have been attempted to be removed; now gone - some were very old stains 3) Coffee Stains 4) Everything but the kitchen sink stains off - except for the holes that people have tosses from live ciggies/cigars to broken glass objects. I AM BEYOND IMPRESSED!"
5.00,"Best detergent I have ever bought that totally got rid of my son's smelly socks!!!!"
4.00,"We work out about 10 hours a week and our exercise clothes are soaked after every workout. This product does a good job of cleaning our exercise clothes but it has a very strong scent so you better like a highly scented detergent. We only use it for exercise clothes as we don't want everything smelling like this product."
5.00,"I just purchased Tide with febreze and couldn't believe my nose. My clothes and linen smell so good and the smell lasts for days. I can't thank you enough. Finally."
5.00,"I'm surprised by the comments listed for this product. My wife and I used to buy another product free of any scent because of perfumes and dyes. They would sometimes irritate the skin. Earlier in the fall of 2011, however, Tide with Febreze was purchased on a whim and we couldn't be happier. The scent of our clothes/sheets is fresh, clean, and extremely long-lasting. Furthermore, we don't seem to be affected by the ingredients/formula that make up this product."
5.00,"What can I say? It does the job at a great price. Having it shipped is a plus. I saved time and gas!"
5.00,"After a few months of waiting, last week I found the seaside fresh at my grocery store I was so happy. When I washed my clothes with it they smelled terrific. I am so pleased with all three products in the Tide febreze collection and will buy these three Tide products most of the time. Tide is the best and I will continue to remain a faithful Tide customer. Keep up the good work Tide."
5.00,"I do a lot of distance running and paddling in the ocean. My workout clothes and towels take a beating. This boost is great! Gets the stink out and gives a nice scent. I'm so glad this is a subscribe and save item."
5.00,"I love this product! My clothes smells great even after you are wearing them all day.Your clothes come out clean and refreshed."
5.00,"I grew up always using Tide only. It was versatile enough to use in the laundry, cleaning the floors and washing dishes. This new product with Febreze is unbeatable. Caring for an elderly parent, with occasional accidents, this product is a Godsend. Not even a hint of a problem after it's laundered. Anyone with children, pets or anyone who is subject to accidents should use this."
5.00,"These pods are the best! My sweaty clothes from the gym come out smelling so clean, I've used these pods to wash muddy shoes and they came out so white they looked like new. Really great!"
5.00,"My daughters house caught fire and sustained heavy smoke damage. Tide with Febreze and a stain booster took the awful smell out of her clothes in one wash."
5.00,"I have been using Tide since I learn to do laundry back in the 5th and 6th grade and its still reliable as it was when I first used it back in 1973 and 74. I love the addition of the different scents and softners."
5.00,"This is the absolute best product for removing perspiration smell from sports clothing! I have been trying for years to \"get the smell out\" of my boys' workout gear - I've used vinegar, baking soda, pine cleaner - nothing has worked until this. It is awesome!"
5.00,"For the price, a great value and my clothes smell wonderful!"
5.00,"I always had problems with sweat smell in my clothes and used to throw them out because I couldn't get rid of the smell. I tried this product and I was in awe.... even old smell came out after a few washes.. and now ther is now smelly problem anymore... thank you Tide!!!"
5.00,"The Best @ Washing"
1.00,"Thought I'd try this on my gym cloths and jeans since both seem to retain odor. Smell of product is OK, but it's way too thick. Continually clogs my liquid dispenser on my HE front loader. So bad to the point, I'm returning it to the store for exchange on a normal Tide product. I've always used Tide, but may start looking at other brands with this experience. Don't waste money on this."
4.00,"I've used Tide products for a number of years, so I was looking forward to trying this. My experience with Febreze has been good too, so I thought the combination of the two products was worth a try. The detergent has a light, fresh scent (not overpowering), which I liked. I am not a fan of strongly scented laundry products. I used the detergent with several different types of laundry, from lightly to heavily soiled. The results were what I expected; each load came out clean and fresh. I depend on Tide to help with even my most difficult laundry issues and I wasn't disappointed. I noticed that the light scent lingered, whether the items were line dried or placed in the dryer. I like this feature as well because I prefer that my laundry stay fresh - and to me, the scent is the main part of this. I will purchase Tide with Febreze again."
1.00,"Please ! If you do ANYthing with this,do something about the god awful stink of the liquid Tide ! It`s horrible,and everyone agrees"
5.00,"This product costs a bit more but is well worth the price. With a house full of athletic teenagers, it makes my job much more doable."
1.00,"I like the Tide Boost stain removers. I feel like they work really well. This one has a Febreze Sport smell and no one in my family likes it. Every time they walk through the laundry room they say \"eww what is that weird smell\". I would recommend getting the regular ones."
5.00,"I have used tide for years, And I just simply love all of the products. And it leaves my clothes smelling great."
1.00,"Won't buy this again sorry"
5.00,"Tide 2x Ultra Liquid detergent works as advertised. It gets your clothes clean much better that some of the lesser brands. We've been making our own detergent now for about 2 years and I must say it's nice to switch to a quality detergent every now or then to \"refresh\" our clothes.I guess If I had to have one complaint it would be the price. There are cheaper brands with the same quality as Tide 2x Ultra.Pricing is one of the reasons we switched to homemade detergents in the first place."
2.00,"i just received the product a while ago, the only problem is when i received the package, the box is open... so some stuff with the tide product been damaged like the bounce box is open with liquid of detergent... they should wrap the dry product and seperate it with the liquids... i dont wanna waste my time return it, i dont like the fedex carrier... you should delivery it by ups nex time..."
5.00,"For our regular laundry, I am a fan of Costo's lavender scented HE detergent. The price and scent is great. It wasn't getting the terrible odor out of my work out clothes. I do heated vinyasa yoga, so am completely covered in sweat 5x/week. For a while I tried doing a vinegar soak before washing my work out clothes. That improved the odor situation, but I didn't feel like the problem was totally solved. This product had been recommended to me by a friend and I've been very pleased with the results. I agree with another reviewer who mentioned that the cap isn't well marked. I don't fill the cap up very high, but the detergent does the job of removing my sweaty odors. It does have a strong scent, but it is not an unpleasant scent. I wouldn't choose to use it on my regular clothes, since it does leave a strong scent in my clothes. The Costco lavender scented detergent is not strong, so works very well for everyday laundry. I'm not sure how this detergent works. I read that Febreze works as it dries by surrounding the stinky particles so you cannot smell them. I've used this product for about a month with great results. I'll attach an update if anything changes!"
1.00,"I love Tide, but when I saw this price, I was sure this had to be a typo. Over $75 for 300 oz. of detergent? I just saw this same item (sold as individual bottles)at a very popular chain's website beginning with a W for about one quarter of the price. It was only $17.95 per bottle so only $35.90 for the same amount."
2.00,"I love this product, and I buy it often at the store. I decided to buy on Amazon because I was purchasing some other items. There is a very odd smell that is very apparent as soon as the package is open. It almost smells as if there is a faint smoke odor in each tablet. Also, these do not dissolve completely in a cold wash cycle; my clothes came out with chunks of the product still on them, and there was a big chunk of it left in the bottom of the washer. I have never had that problem when I have bought from the store! Perhaps Amazon sold a product that was old and past its shelf life? I will not be buying this, and probably not much of any other laundry product, from Amazon for a very long time."
5.00,"The greatest detergent ever !!!"
4.00,"I love Tide with Febreze. However, like one of the other reviewers, I really miss the Citrus and Light Scent! I am not a big fan of floral type scents, so the Citrus one was perfect! There should be another scent like that, and the product will be even more perfect than it already is!"
1.00,"I agree with the other reviews of the horrible odor, it is NOT a frangrant smell, it is almost like a mildewy automotive smell, it is horrible! Had a friend mention the same with this product, it mostly just effects the towels. WIill no buy this again! I am surprised anyone finds it \"fragrant\"?"
5.00,"Smells great and are super easy to use, make sure to keep them in a dry area though, under the sink they might tear from moisture and make every pod in the bag covered in soap but other than that I've been buying these pods for over a year."
5.00,"You can smell these things if you leave the bag open. Granted the scent is nice, but a bit overpowering. Luckily when you wash your clothes, it doesn't stick around for long. I use them with my towels since they were coming out of the washer still smelling a bit \"musty\". Towels now smell great and it does help with any stains found on the kids clothes as well. I usually use the extra rinse cycle when using these on clothes for us or the kids."
5.00,"It leaked in my box :-("
5.00,"It's like having an 'old fashioned' sachet in my dresser drawers, everything smells fresh for a long time."
1.00,"I've made plenty of mistakes in my life, but I never thought that I needed to be cautious about what laundry detergent I bought. Apparently, the wrong detergent can ruin your week. This stuff leaves a disgusting odor on your clothes. If you touch the clothes, your hand will get the disgusting odor. It spreads in the air. It's awful. I'm starting to get headaches from it, and I generally just feel ill. I'm going to rewash everything in normal laundry soap now."
5.00,"THE FIRST TIME I TRIED IT...I WAS HOOKED AND WILL NEVER CHANGE USING TIDE WITH FABREEZE!!!!!!"
5.00,"Well being deployed to Kenya, and not having the access of good that we have back in the US, kind of makes it hard to enjoy. so what better way to make it a well worth deployment than by using product that we are used to back home..so over all Im satisfy on the product and Walmart on being able to ship to us armforces personel"
5.00,"My son works in a restaurant. After trying MANY laundry products to remove that horrible \"restaurant\" smell from his work clothes, I purchased Tide with Febreze. The results are everything I hoped for. His clothes smell FRESH. A co-worker even commented, \"You smell good.\"Thank you for developing this product. I LOVE IT!"
5.00,"I have loved Tide for years and now with the Tide Febreze I am even more happy with them!  It really does freshen up towels and leaves a nice light scent on them.  Tide is the one detergent we have found that cleans our clothes without fading them out and ruining them.  I've used it for a very long time and now will have a hard time deciding between the Tide with Downy and Tide with Febreze!!  With 4 kids we really need a good detergent that will keep their clothes looking great and this is it!"
5.00,"I started using this product a little over a year ago. And I've been hooked ever since! I'm not picky on which scent and this is another one that works well in cold water as well."
5.00,"We tried this product and love it. I love the way it smells and cleans our clothes. Tide has always been my detergent of choice.Just need to get it in bigger bottles."
5.00,"I am a fanatic when it comes to my laundry! It has to be clean(obviously), and it has to smell wicked good. I used to take forever in the store picking out a detergent. I had to make sure it smelled just perfect. Well, a little FYI...Tide w/Febreze Freshness Spring & Renewal is awesome! One use and I was hooked. I love this stuff. The only thing is that I really want to buy a bigger bottle. I have been to every local retailer within 30 miles and can't find it in the bigger bottle(see, told you I love it). Do they even offer it in that size? I hope that this particular scent for HE machines never gets discontinued!! Please keep it forever. One bad thing I have to say is, the Tide w/Febreze Sport scent smelled horrible!! I will never buy that particular scent again. It was just gross."
5.00,"Love tide with febreze , love the smell & it get my clothes clean"
5.00,"Great price and it works fabulously. Laundry is cleaner and it smells great, love the packaging on this product as well. It was delivered as promised."
5.00,"I must be honest and upfront I bought this item at first because I buy almost all Febreze Products. I'd never used Tide before but man was I amazed. Not only do my clothes come out clean and keep their color well, they smell fantastic! It is a strong scent the Tide smell mixed with Febreze so you really have to like it but I love it! If I could I'd marry this product. Sometimes I'll wash things that are clean just to smell the wonderful scent! What a great feeling crawling into bed of clean sheets with a heavenly smell.... puts me right to sleep!I think it goes without mentioning that I'd recommend this product to a friend."
5.00,"I love this detergent. It's been a solution to my long life problem of getting odors out of clothes. You ever have a problem with towels that have that \"wet\" smell? You ever have work out clothes that no matter how many times you wash them, have that musty smell? Do you have linen that just smells old? Well, worry no more because this detergent will get rid of all those smells. You will not be sorry for buying this detergent."
5.00,"First time ordering from Walmart and was very impressed. Great prices and fast delivery. Will be visiting web site more often."
4.00,"I can't remember why I stopped using powdered detergent, I believe it may have been that I considered the bottles easier to transport. Looking back, I now find that silly after having dealt with liquid detergent leakage on more than one occasion. Opening the Amazon packaging reminded me a little of what it was like to deal with powdered detergent; I noticed almost a small load's worth of detergent scattered throughout the box, but I simply upended the box over the washing machine.                                                                     The only issue I have is that I had to open the box with the top flaps rather than the strip provided, because the amount of powder inside the box reached higher than the opening strip. If I had used the strip, I would have gotten powdered detergent all over the place.                                                                     The detergent smells terrific, and I think it will come pretty close to the advertised amount of loads on the box. Definitely a product I'd use again."
5.00,"I love the Bounce with Febreze as well."
5.00,"I started using Tide Boost last year and I now use it with every wash load. It really smells great and helps keep my workout clothes fresh."
5.00,"I haven't used powder detergent for some time because it doesn't always dissolve quickly in cold water, but this stuff dissolved perfectly and rinsed cleanly.  Plus, it smells great, and nothing cleans better than Tide.  Packaging for powders is also better for the environment than the plastic used for liquids, so I'll be using this product from now on.  And the scent is great -- not too heavy, just right."
5.00,"I love this product. I love the smell of it. I am not a tide fan, I don't like the normal Tide smell, but this product has made me one. I had a favorite shirt that I wore for years using Cheer as my laundry detergent. I thought I would have to throw it away because it was smelling bad in the pits even after it was washed. I used this a few times and now it smells fresh and clean. Thank you Tide for this great product."
5.00,"Tide with Febreze is the best laundry detergent on the market! Everything smells fresh and clean and it stays for up to a week at least! I live in the bush of Alaska and so to be able to have it sent thru the mail is wonderful. Only wish I could get the fabric softener with Febrese sent up here as well. I would highly recommend this product to anyone!"
5.00,"This detergent isn't for your average, every day folk who want to just have clean clothes. This is for those of us who are heavily into our workouts/training, as well as those who sweat a great deal (my dh is a chef and he's a big old \"sweater\"). Those who voted for it negatively already knew this is who the detergent is geared towards, why vote it down? I'm thankful it's available, otherwise my clothes would be stinking up the place (and those cheap ones you get in the supermarket don't cut it when you're a pile of sweat!)"
1.00,"Tide Fabreze just streaked a bunch of brand new high quality cotton towels. It is not safe for use in cold water with dark colors; it caused the dark colors to fade. There should be a warning on the product. Use with whites only."
1.00,"This stuff leaves an overpowering, nauseating chemical scent on your clothing. I'm not sensitive to fragrances but this stuff gives me a headache. Now my workout gear smells even worse. I will be going back to my regular detergent. I'm sorry that I wasted so much money on this."
1.00,"My husband works out everyday and eventually the material that workout clothes are made of retain odor. My other brand of detergent works fine for our regular laundry, but I trusted the Tide name so much that I bought this brand in the 200 oz size at a wholesale club. I was EXTREMELY disappointed! The clothes came out with a terrible odor that was extremely difficult to get out. I actually had to run my HE machine with just a few items instead of a full load and a full cup of detergent. A waste of time and money!"
5.00,"I'm a big fan of Era detergent. I've been using this brand for years. I was so happy to see Era make this detergent with Febreze freshness. I love this detergent. It smells so good! It leaves our clothes smelling fresh and clean. I think it works just as well as Tide, if not better. I was using Era Fistful of Fresh before this. That laundry detergent smells awesome too. I'll buy this laundry detergent over and over again. I give it 5 stars!"
5.00,"I have used Tide for decades but, after being divorced, I had to give up some of the better brand things & go with cheaper items. Well, after trying different soaps, I have discovered that using Tide is less expensive. The other stuff did not clean as well or did my clothes smell like they do with Tide. It is true you get what you pay for."
5.00,"It does 'boost' the color and smell of our laundry. I added this in with the other pod for each load of laundry. Not only does it make our clothes smelling better, it also adds a great scent to your closet/drawers. I would highly recommend it."
4.00,"Easier to carry to laundry room than all the extra bottles. So I have gone to Pods when possible. thanks"
5.00,"I have used Tide with fabreeze for a couple of years now. I have recommended it to my friends. (who by the way switched). I love the smell and it makes everything smell clean. When I get into bed or snuggle with a blanket it adds cozyness as well. LOVE IT!!!"
5.00,"I have been using tide for as long as I can remember. I love tide and it just got better with Fabreze in it!"
5.00,"I bought front loaders almost a year ago, had never used tide before ...however with the front loaders I decided to try Tide HE Febreze Spring & Renewal as I loved the scent while at the store. I've been dedicated to it ever since. My clothes are so clean and smell so good! I would really like to see it available in a larger container, I live miles outof town and having to gather many smaller containers is a little inconvienient. If you decide to make this product available in a larger container and in Canada, please let me know...I'll be all over it!!thanks!!!"
5.00,"Excellent"
2.00,"Still looking for a good detergent for my running clothes. This stuff merely masked the smell with a VERY strong perfume-chemical odor. I always let my workout clothes air dry and while they were drying our ENTIRE house smelled of the stuff. I get the feeling this is just normal detergent with a ton of scent added. Next. (?)"
1.00,"Won't buy this again sorry"
4.00,"I must say buying this detergent definitely saved me some money and I don't have to buy detergent for the next two months! I will always buy my detergent from this website."
5.00,"I've never been a liquid laundry detergent fan but this Tide has hooked me. The convenience is beautiful: no laundry powder 'dust' around my washing machine and it dissolves instantly. My whites are noticeably brighter, as well. Most importantly though, was the immediate subtle fragrance that hit me when removing clothes from the dryer. My husband even commented that his work-out clothes seemed to smell fresher AFTER he worked out in them! Don't know how that happened but it is a first and I am sold!"
5.00,"I use this product faithfully and it works very well for me. My clothes launder beautifully and smell good after washing. I am a happy camper!"
5.00,"My Tide Ultra with Febreze Freshness Spring and Renewal Scent Powder arrived just five days after my request. At first glance, I thought this detergent was making some pretty big claims. I mean, I expect freshness, but Freshness Spring? AND Renewal Scent? Let's face it, renewal wouldn't hurt, but I'm more in need of actual renovation...and some parts are complete tear downs. Nothing will bring them up to code again. Still, renewal is a step in the right direction...but could Tide deliver??????I have always hated schlepping a Super Economy Sized box of laundry detergent...the kind that's as big as a Fiat, so I liked this Tide's light weight and compact size. Anyway, I opened the EZ open top, poured the small amount required into a measuring cup and headed to the dismal world of The Laundry Room.The detergent did exactly what it was supposed to do, my clothes were clean, even the grease stains on drapes seemed to be completely gone (I hadn't tasted spare ribs in a really long time, I was alone, things got crazy). Beyond clean, the clothes definitely had a special something...yes, a real Freshness...maybe even Freshness Spring. And considering that some of them had been in the hamper since 1983, this was a major milestone in the annals of Freshness.I was quite content, over all, with the results. \"Good Tide, old fashioned laundry standby, worked for my mother, works for me,\" I thought. And then it hit me. The Renewal Scent. It came wafting up from the laundry basket as I trudged down the walkway from laundry room to my front door. At first sniff, I wasn't sure what was happening...and then the full Renewing Power of Tide hit me like bus filled with Hope and Expectation. If a baby's first smile has a smell, if believing in love at first sight has an aroma, if hoping that the IRS won't notice the deduction for Stuart Weitzman black and gold boots has a fragrance, this is it.I'm looking forward to doing another load laundry and may not wait until I'm forced to wear the sofa slipcover and pretend it's avant garde fashion.Tide Ultra with Febreze Freshness Spring and Renewal Scent. Believe."
5.00,"I have well water at my house. Our water tends to go through cycles when it comes to the smell of it. If I do the laundry during one of the \"smelly\" times, I can tell you that NOTHING can make my laundry smell good EXCEPT Tide with Febreze! I get comments on how good it smells when I use it! I don't buy anything else!"
4.00,"When I first purchased these I did not read the description thoroughly and thought I was getting the Tide Pods detergent. This product is a boost, used along with the detergent. In all, it worked out ok. We use Tide HE Febreeze sport liquid detergent, so this made our clean laundry smell even nicer! I don't add a boost tablet every time, only when we have extra smelly & sweaty workout clothes. When I do use, our clothes smell good after & the laundry room smells even better! We have a Maytag Bravos HE top load and have not had any issues adding this tablet."
3.00,"always buy the same brand"
1.00,"I agree with another reviewer. I would give this negative 5 stars if I could. If you want to indelibly saturate your clothes in a smell I would compare to a \"little tree\" cab freshener, this is for you. I have now washed not only my dryer but all my clothes 3 times, and they still make me smell like a giant car air freshner. Unless you live in a zoo, nobody needs this type of smell on them."
5.00,"Bought this to try on my husbands work clothes, he's in maintenance, and in the summer especially, they can really stink. First time I used it, he said his clothes smelled like bubble gum, and he never wanted to use anything else again. He started recommending it to everyone he worked with, made his buddies sniff his clothes, it was hilarious. It's the only thing we use now. Love the scent, love the product!"
3.00,"It smells nice enough but it does not \"whiten whites\".  I've run several loads of mixed bag things.  Socks don't look any better, shirt and trouser garden dirt is still there, white towels look brownish.  These were run in warm wash/cold rinse.  I'm sure they are not nasty but they are not well done.                                                                     Can not suggest you run to the store."
1.00,"I have always been a Tide user and will continue to do so but I can't stand the smell of the Spring & Renewal Tide. It stinks up my laundry room every time I use it and stays that way the whole day. It almost smells like dirty socks to me. Yuck!"
5.00,"I have to admit, I wasn't a buyer of Tide before getting these bottles to review. I try to use all natural soaps and detergents as much as possibly in our home and therefore purchased detergents such as Seventh Generation and the like. Unfortunately, even after washing and drying with those detergents, I could still smell lingering perfume/cologne or sweat on the clothes. They were not being cleaned properly.After using an entire bottle of Tide, I feel confident in saying that I am changing my laundry detergent. I was surprised at what a difference there was between the detergents...I really didn't think it would be nearly as drastic as it was. The Tide cleans thoroughly and with a very small amount of detergent actually used. It smells pleasant without smelling perfumey and works well even with cold water. A bottle lasted almost 2 months, so it's cost effective as well. Overall, I was very impressed."
5.00,"Great product to grid rid of tough gym stains and smells. This product leaves the clothes smelling fresh and like new."
3.00,"I have a 2 year old and a 4 year old, their clothes get stains! This product releases the stains and gets wires bright, but the scent... It's like a foul smelling floral that you just don't want to smell. I plug my nose when I use it, thankfully there's no smell after the clothes come out of the dryer, but woah!"
3.00,"I agree with other reviewers; I was so excited when I used this powdered detergent and pulled my clothes from the washer because they smelt amazing!! Unfortunately, after I put them in the dryer with a dryer sheet (that had a very mild scent) they did not smell like they once did! I smelt nothing! This happened each time I used this detergent. I am not exactly sure as to why the scent is not sticking on my clothes but I was very disappointed in the fact that it didn't. It seems like a decent detergent, it gets my clothes clean, I just wish the \"freshness\" would have lasted a bit longer. I see on Tide's website that they suggest buying matching dryer sheets to the detergent you are using. I might have to try that because this scent is really nice! ...when it lasts ;)"
5.00,"I've been using Tide for a long time now. It has always given me good results. The the amount and price at Walmart, you can't beat that. I can't find a price this around where i live."
5.00,"i use to use tide mountain fresh but now the tide with febreze in it is wounderful. I love it. I work out and i do not want to wash such a small load, with tide with febreze i can wait another day. Thanks Tide you will be the only one brought into my house"
5.00,"Seemed to work well in cleaning clothes and scent was refeshing. Love the conveinence of the Pods , no messy powders or liquids"
5.00,"Great value and it's been working for me for years, never disappoints me :)"
5.00,"I am in LOVE with Tide's Spring & Renewal Detergent and Softner! It is the only detergent that I will use.... I get tons of compliments on the way that my clothes smell! Try it out! :)"
5.00,"I like this size bottle. It is easy to carry up and down stairs or to the laundry mat. If you pair with a P&G Amazon coupon this Pack of 2 is a pretty good deal."
5.00,"TIDE IS GOOD. TIDE ALWAYS HAS BEEN GOOD. IT IS THE ONLY LAUNDRY SOAP PRODUCT THAT YOU ACTUALLY DO NOT NEED MORE THAN THE CAP FULL TO DO A LOAD. I WORKED IN MACHINE SHOPS FOR YEARS BUT TIDE ALWAYS CAME THROUGH. I WAS RECENTLY TAKING CARE OF MY SICK MONEY. ANY MESS THIS WILL CLEAN UP.AND THE SMELL AFTERWARDS IS DELIGHTFUL. IT LASTS AND LASTS SO WHEN YOU PULL YOUR FAVORITE NUGHTY OUT OF THE DRAWER IT SMELLS LIKE IT WAS JUST WASHED. AND IT IS A GREAT SMELL..CLEAN AND FRESH SMELL. I DO NOT WANT MY CLOTHES SMELLING LIKE LAVENDER OR FRUIT..OR EVEN HAWAIIAN! I WANT THAT NICE FRESH CLEAN SMELL!....AHHHH"
5.00,"Excellent product. Always consistent, no harsh chemicals."
5.00,"Awesome Product..........is there another brand? Even in cutting costs I still buy Tide.......because I love the fresh clean scent of my clothes, and you don't have to use so much to get the cleanliness you want for your clothes. ........"
4.00,"I am a HE machine and for the most part use the cold and quick cycle - and it does the trick just fine as clothes come out clean and fresh. Where we have struggled is with work out gear! I work out each morning before work - and I mean really work out hitting cardio and weights with some ferocity! Though not a particularly sweaty person, the clothes I wear are wicking, absorbing workout sweat and here is my biggest issue - they then sit in a plastic bag, tied tightly, in my workout bag which resides in my truck from morning to night! As a result a normal wash was not doing the trick - main issue was a lot of my workout stuff could not be dried post wash and that lycra wicking stuff began to develop a slight mold smell that I could not shake and rather grossly, it become more pronounced as I worked my way through my morning exercise! So I gave these a try! I used them on my regular cold cycle, dropping them in the barrel of my HE machine and I have to say I am happy with the results! The clothes smell divine and that smell is still present after the dryer cycle. I have no idea if clothes look cleaner as that was never my issue, but they smell cleaner. My workout clothes smell great and though the wash scent dissipates quite soon after the clothes are dry - it is not replaced with the moldy scent!! I am happy to say I am not having to throw out and replace my gym clothes quite so often now so this is also saving me money! Very happy with this product!"
4.00,"From what I can glean from websites, HE liquid in a regular machine is OK, you just get less suds. But you can not vice versa the situation."
5.00,"Love Tide! Love it! Febreze one is great! No complaints works well"
1.00,"Nothing for people with sensitive skin, even the products with no perfume cause terrible rashes and my body itches all over for weeks now. Can't get it out of the clothes."
1.00,"anyone who uses febreze, either by itself or in Tide, is helping to stink up the world - it is awful stuff - ask P&G for ALL of its ingredients -- hate this stuff"
5.00,"Great product. Smells amazing. my background: I am a 25 yr old, I'm a girl who loves great smelling clothes, sheets, room."
5.00,"This product is fabulous, I even found my Husband using it, it smells so Good and Cleans Great. I won't use anything else."
3.00,"Im not sure the scent can be trusted in a business professional setting! Outside use is fine!"
5.00,"Tide plus Febreze Freshness Liquid Laundry Detergent works great. Make my whole house smell GREAT and keeps my clothes smelling great even if I dont wear it for over a week!!!! excellent PRODUCT!!"
3.00,"I also love the Febreze SPORT and was disappointed when I purchased a new HE machine that I was not able to use the SPORT scent for the HE."
5.00,"This Tide with febreeze smells great and removed all stains I had. My wifes clothes and I aren't extremely dirty but we both loved the lasting smell that stuck with our clothes."
4.00,"This detergent works on odors.  I did a load of my husband's gym cloths, without adding any other fresheners or anything, and the wash came out smelling clean and fresh.  Normally I add borax and fabric softener -- it wasn't necessary.                                                                     So then I tried my next test:  I sometimes forget to take my wash out of the washer right away -- and it can get funky smelling surprisingly fast.  So I did a load with this, left it for an hour, and it was fine.  I did another load and left it two hours -- it still smelled great.  I did another load and left it overnight -- guess what?  It still smelled great!  (I still rerinsed the load because that's kinda gross).                                                                     I will say it's not as good as liquid tide on tough stains.  I did have a few of my 10 year old son's shirts that needed to be done again in a load with liquid Tide (which is my go-to for stain removal).  But this stuff is great for stinky gym clothes!"
4.00,"Tide with Febreze works great on both colors and whites.  It brightened my white sheets leaving them with a soft, subtle scent and no static cling from the dryer.  I've tried all kinds of things to keep my synthetic work-out clothes from sticking together, and worse yet, having my collie's hair stick to them, and this Tide does a great job.                                                                     I have a front-loader washer so it doesn't run a lot of water through the clothes, and the downside of saving water is that my clothes, especially the towels, were not smelling so fresh.  With this Tide I don't have to do an extra rinse which saves on water.  Also, I use so little because of the concentration of Tide, that I'm saving trees by using less packaging, and I don't have to buy any dryer sheets, which also saves on packaging and cost.                                                                     Now if Tide could just take out all the things that are bad for the environment, this product would be just about perfect."
4.00,"If your compression clothes, under armor - or any workout clothing with moisture wicking properties retain some smell this is a great product. I will say Win detergent worked slightly better - but it was annoying to have to carry down a special detergent just for my load of clothes that were workout clothes. These you can throw in your pocket (and if you use Tide Pods then you have an awesome laundry regimen that's easy too)"
4.00,"This new Tide laundry detergent with Febreeze is another excellent product that leaves your clothes smelling fresh and clean. This product is also a good stain remover. In addition, it is highly concentrated, which will allow you to use less detergent. However, this product is overpriced compared to other products that might give you similar results. If you are a Tide loyalist who enjoys fresh scented laundry, this new item might be worth trying."
5.00,"Gets the laundry clean and smells great"
5.00,"Im already using your products. But after seeing the Venus Williams spot on TV you have customer for life. I will be buying the Febreze Tide next time I shop. I also love how well the stain removing tablets work keep up the great work."
2.00,"I think this is causing issues with my LG Tromm washers, too many suds."
5.00,"Thanks for make fresh clean laundry easy to achieve."
5.00,"My husband operates a poultry farm. I was using bleach on all his clothes just to remove the odor from his clothes. Then I tried Tide with Febreze and it Works Great! no more using bleach to help with the odors, just the Tide works wonderfully.Thanks Tide!!"
1.00,"Please smell this detergent before you buy it. This smell is so sweet it is sickening and it aggravates my allergies. I picked it up by mistake--expensive mistake! I'll try to tough it out before I buy new detergent unless I just can't stand it anymore. Seriously this stuff smells horrible!"
5.00,"Ever since I started using Tide with Febreze; my husband's work clothes have not had any oil, dirt, etc. odors. His clothes smell fresh and clean. I only use this product because it definitely works. I have told a lot of my friends and relatives, and even people in stores if they are by the soap products. They seem to trust my judgement."
5.00,"Cleans clothes better than any other detergent"
1.00,"I bought this product because my daughter plays softball and her uniforms and practice clothes get extremely stinky. The product smells good in the bottle, so I was really surprised when the clothes and front loading machine stunk after I used it. The clothes almost smelled worse after I washed them, kind of like a mildewy/urine scent that is hard to describe. I have tried to use this product on several loads and have had the same outcome. So disappointed in this product because all of the other Tide products I've tried have been very high quality. Thankfully the Tide Washing Machine Cleaner made my machine smell good again; and I have switched back to the Clean Breeze scented Tide that makes my clothes smell clean and fresh. I actually came to the website to read other people's reviews to see if they have encountered the same problem that I did. Apparently I'm not the only one who thinks that it makes clothes smell terrible. I feel like I wasted my money on this product."
5.00,"This product has the most amazing smell! I love it so much that I can't seem to get enough of it! We happened upon this Tide product while on vacation in Napa. My husband and I are military members who not only sweat when we work, but are required to constantly workout. This product takes the horrible smells away and we constantly have people who ask us what detergent we use....my secret!"
5.00,"I have been an avid Gain user for years until I tried Tide with Febreze....it gets rid of all types of smells. I have a teenager who plays alot of sports, and sometimes his sweaty clothes stay in his locker at school for days--they are disgusting!!! This is the only detergent I have found that removes ALL of the odor (no matter how putrid) the FIRST time. I have told everyone about this product. Thank you for Tide w/ Febreze!!!!!! :)"
5.00,"I've used Tide with Febreeze ever since it first came out. I won't buy detergent unless I can get the Tide with Febreeze. I've found that a little goes a long way. I've noticed others saying that it smells too strong, and thought immediately that perhaps they were using too much. My husbands job requires he climb into machines, which gets his clothing very oily. He also has to clean oil up on a regular basis, this has required he crawl through oil. And he sometimes get oil all over him from broken lines. Tide with Febreeze always gets it all out and does a fabulous job getting that oil smell out also. We are also raising two of our grandsons, so I am always dealing with anything from food and grass to milk and paint in their clothing. I love Tide with Febreeze and would not want to use anything else."
5.00,"I've been using the Spring Renewal scent for about 4 years now and won't use anything else. The smell is GREAT!"
5.00,"Just need to get it in bigger bottles."
1.00,"I have three children who are active in sports. I used this detergent hoping it would help eliminate odors and now my kids clothes smell like cat pee. I finally got sick of it and poured the detergent down the kitchen sink drain. My husband came down and asked \"what is that horrible smell?\" Don't buy this product. I went back to my tried and true (and very green) way of getting rid of smells ---adding vinegar to the wash. No more smell and I'm saving lots of money."
5.00,"I always used generic detergent in my old washer...had to buy a new one and use the HE, so I thought I'd splurge & try Tide. I feel like my clothes are cleaner, brighter & smell better. It's probably a combination of the new washer and Tide detergent, but I'm not going to use any other detergent. I am very happy with this product."
2.00,"Thank You"

5.00,"loooove tide with febreze"
1.00,"I used this on regular clothes and towels and they all stink. Now I have got to re-wash everything. One review on the web said it's hard to get the smell out. I would never buy this again. I am a huge Tide fan but the smell is way too strong."
5.00,"My family LOVES Tide. I would always purchase Original or April Fresh. Since you have added Sports to the collection, that is the only one for us. IWhen I go to purchase laundry detergent if iSports is not avalible I will travel to another store until I find it. When my son brings his clothes home to wash I would have to wash his socks twice. Tide, I would like to thank you. Now the smell of my laundry is breath taking. Would it ever be availble in a larger size?"
2.00,"Don't be a derp like me and order this for your HE washer. I just gave them away to family and friends who had normal washers."
5.00,"I use Febreze Freshness to help clean my daughter's volleyball clothes. Sometimes they really could use something strong to penetrate all of the perspiration odor. So, I am happy to know about 'Tide Plus Febreze.\" It has truly been a life saver! Thanks."
3.00,"I love Tide.  Over the decades I've experimented here and there, but honestly I have never found anything that cleans as well -- especially on heavy summer dirt.                                                                     I usually use the non-scented Tide(he), but decided that it might be nice to wash the towels in something faintly scented. I really like regular Tide-he for this purpose, so when I saw the Febreze Sport version on sale I thought I would give it a try.                                                                     BIG mistake.  The bathroom fairly reeks.  And unlike the regular Tide, which I can also use on clothes if I've run out of unscented; this scent is so clingy that it doesn't wash out well, and as a consequence I don't dare use it for my family's clothes as it aggravates our asthma.                                                                     So 3-Stars.  This Tide cleans but the odor is just too much.  And I certainly wouldn't advise anyone with respiratory problems to use it if they find regular Tide at all irritating.                                                                     Pam T~                                              mom/blogger"
5.00,"I've been using free and clear detergents for a while now because I have sensitive skin. I didn't think I could use scented detergents. However, I really loved the smell of Tide with Febreze and found it in HE. I bought it on sale and thought I'd give it a try. It gave my clothes a finished \"new\" look, bright, without stains. And it smells great. It did not irritate my sensitive skin in any way, which is very really something because everything seems to. I have even used it on my babies clothes and it got out the tough stains from formula, etc. and has not bothered her skin. I really am glad I tried this stuff and am going to keep on using it."
5.00,"This detergent is Wonderful!!  What else can we expect from Tide?  I searched all over the internet and in stores for this particular Seaside Scent and could not find it, until I learned that Amazon stocked it.  It comes with 6 50oz bottles and free shipping.  Very good value and no hassle shopping.  It came within 5 days that I ordered it!  I wish they made this in the powder formula.  Two thumbs up on this purchase!!!!"
5.00,"Tide combined with Febreze seems to give clothes an added fresh aroma - which in wet, soggy, moldy Washington state, is welcome!  To be honest, I had switched away from Tide, and thought I was happy with the product I was using, until I tried the new Tide and could see and smell the difference.  I'm using less stain remover, too, as this Tide seems to go to work on most common stains.  I'm a convert!"
5.00,"With a husband who works construction and 2 teenage daughters active in sports, it was hard to find a product that would not only get out dirt but also odors. Once we tried Tide plus Febreze SPORT with the Active Fresh Scent we were hooked. It does cost a little bit more but is so worth it!! I truly believe this is the best product out there right now!! I would (and have) highly recommend it!"
3.00,"I'm not sure how effective it is on my clothes, but it smells like fresh fertilized garden. Now I smell like one too. Go figure."
5.00,""
5.00,"i like this product, but smells bad."
5.00,"Okay, I used another liquid detergent with Febreze in it, and it worked all right. I got a sample in the mail so I tried Tide with Febreze because I wanted that smell of freshness and I was skeptical, but now Tide with Febreze Freshness Liquid is the ONLY liquid detergent I have bought in the last year. Not only does it deliver a clean smelling freshness, it cleans my clothes without fading or leaving spotting on them, and now they have the new Acti-lift, which gives me even more reason to use Tide! Tide is keeping me and my clothes happy, and to use something else is unthinkable."
1.00,"I'm furious with Walmart. I send big packages to my nieces in college in Georgia and have done so for a couple of years.... and you are usually so good at taping down and securing wet items. Instead the spouts on the Tide nor the shampoo were NOT taped down and my niece had a big mess to clean up. She claims that non of the food items were damaged but the box of tampax was. what are you going to do about it?"
5.00,"Love these laundry boosters. Adds some scent, makes clothes feel extra clean. I use these in our regular clothing, but every now and again give an extra burst of clean to bathroom or kitchen towels."
4.00,"I received my 116 ounce box of Tide and I must say I noticed the packaging right away and it was very nice.  There is a strip you pull to open the box that didn't work very well.  I ended up with part of the box ripped.  This Tide is in powder form and I don't care for powder as I have to wait a while for the washer to fill and dissolve the powder.  I prefer a liquid or the new sheet detergent, fabric softener and dryer sheet in one.  However, the Tide smell was very nice, not overpowering, but you definitely noticed it right away.  I never buy Tide as it is too expensive and I firmly believe that other detergents out there for less money work just as well.  With that thought in mind, I used the Tide.  I washed Tee shirts and blue jeans. I must say when I pulled the clothes out of the washer they appeared to be a bit brighter.  And then when the clothes came out of the dryer, I noticed my husband's Tee Shirts looked quite a bit brighter.  I can honestly say that the detergent worked and smelled as it proclaimed.  It would remove tough odors, has a lasting fragrance but the most important item is does it clean my clothes.  I can say that it did."
3.00,"My brother was visiting, I ran out of Tide He powder, he needed to wash his clothes so he went to the store and purchased this Tide plus febreze Sport liquid He. Other reviewers refer to its 'clean' scent. My nose think it stinks, it thinks it makes the laundry room area stink, and it thinks it makes my clothes stink. Maybe my nose is just a bit unique compared to others, but in deference to my nose, I will never have this stuff in my house again. I gave it 3 stars because it cleans just fine, the cap/measurer design is uniquely effective and, just maybe, it smells bad only to me and not to others. Follow-up: I have since found that once my Maytag finishes washing my clothes, if I then place the dial in the Extra Rinse position, then again press Start, that awful Tide HE Febreze smell in my clothes goes away for the most part."
5.00,"I have used this Tide & this specific scent ever since Tide joined with Febreze so it's over 10 years (haven't kept track because I've used Tide 30+ years). For those of you who haven't used it or perhaps like me once tried a cheaper brand (but of course the next week came right back been ever since) You won't be sorry.My clothes have never been cleaner/ brighter & smelling ahh so so good! For the price it is worth it I will never try another brand of laundry soap again unless Tide would go out of business which I highly doubt.Seriously if you want to look & smell your best than BUY IT !! Luv Luv this scent please keep it around..."
5.00,"I love Tide and I love this scent!"
5.00,"I have tried other sports detergents that promise to remove that post-workout odor only to be disappointed. This product works so well that even after 75 minutes of cardio, a yoga class, and some weight-training, my clothes still smell great."
5.00,"This works well and makes the laundry clean. Its a no nonsense and its one drop it in and walk away so convenient."
1.00,"Stinks sooooo bad!!!!! Regardless of whether it worked or not, i didn't even want to try it... I actually threw it out as soon as i opened it and realized how bad it smelled. I will stick the regular Boost...."
5.00,"I love the online groceries shopping I wish I can get everything I need"
5.00,"I love the Tide with Febreze. All my laundry comes out fresh and clean. Everything has a wonderful scent. I have had my HE washer for over 8 years. At the time of purchase it was very difficult to find HE detergents. Tide has always been my favorite, and I am very happy to see more HE Tide Detergent's now available. If possible please make a larger size Tide/Febreze /HE. The 26 load doesn't last very long in our houshold. Excellent Product if you like keeping your clothes looking nice! Thank You for the HE availability!"
1.00,"I was excited to try a product that is supposed to work well with workout clothes. Being a long distance runner, clothes smell after time. Since the first use of this product in a Front Loader, my new washing machine reeks of order and mildew-type smell and my clothes smell horrible and have since been trying to wash out the smell with a different detergent. What the heck??? If I left them in the machine for even an hour after washer was finished, I had to rewash my clothes. I have tried a few more times with the same result. Very disappointed, as I bought two bottles and this stuff isn't exactly cheap. I now have to buy the washing machine cleaner. Let's hope that this Tide product lives up to it's expectations!!Not sure how others are getting good results from this product, unless top loaders are getting different result!"
5.00,"I Love Tide with the fabreez. Makes my cloths smell fresh for weeks in the drawer. And of course the cleaning power of tide cant be beat"
1.00,"Product makes blue spots on clothes and it smell digusting."
5.00,"Love the scent! It says 90 loads but I actually marked my usage and discovered an extra 15 loads. It is definitely an ultra, you do not need to fill the cap. I only fill it to the first line of the cap and that is more than enough to wash one whole load. With the fabreze freshness, you don't even need a fabric softener. Look at it as a 2 in 1 (laundry soap plus fabric softener) it's perfect. Also, the extra security of tape on cap and additional bagging for shipping was just awesome. My package arrived in great condition without damage and spills. I plan to purchase additional quantity to use as a gift to my sister. Thank you walmart.com for the fine services being provided."
4.00,"I used to purchase Win detergent for getting out my smelly odors in my exercise clothes and it really did work! Unfortunately, can't find that product anymore so had been trying several others to try and replace it. Think i finally found my replacement! This Tide with Febreze Freshness REALLY does the trick! My clothes come clean and smell fresh so bye-bye Win and hello Tide Febreze!"
5.00,"I absolutely LOVE this new Tide with Fabreeze. Even my house smells good when they are in the dryer. And the sheets after washing them in Tide, it keeps smelling great days after I wash them. My husband is in construction, so you know he gets dirty. This new Tide gets them clean and he smells so nice, I have teased him that all the other fellas on the construction sight will notice how nice he smells. I dont think I would ever use anything ever again after using this product. I am completely sold. I love it, keep up the good work Tide."
5.00,"Tide is my favorite in most laundry products and this is no exception. I have a busy two year old, a husband with white work shirts and I work out quite a bit myself, and all the clothes come out stain free, and smelling great. I'm so glad I found this product on Amazon for such a great price!"
5.00,"I am not sure why all the negative comments on the smell of this product. I combine this with the Downy with Febreze Freshness Spring And Renewal with great results. I am a stay at home dad and the laundry room is my domain. I have used both of the products for the past 3 years. I constantly have people asking me how I do the laundry and get it to smell so good. To each his own I reckon."
1.00,"This made my clothes reek of soap and no matter how many times I've rinsed them, it won't come out. I had been hoping the febreze inside would make my clothes smell pleasant, but it makes me smell like walking bar of Irish Spring. Seriously, the soap smell is overpowering. Do yourself a favor and buy a different type of tide."
4.00,"I have long thought that Tide offers the best-value detergent, the most cleaning power per Dollar. The added benefits of this particular product are that it's concentrated and perfumed. I say 'perfumed' because it's a definite, fairly strong floral scent and not just a 'clean' smell. It also lingers in the washed articles, as intended. That may or may not be what you want from your detergent.I tested it out on a tablecloth that had a stubborn tea stain that a bottle of stain remover and several washes had failed to vanquish. One wash with this product did the trick. I used too much of the detergent (as I say, it's concentrated) and the tablecloth came out of the washer all sticky and waxy. I put it through the rinse again and it was fine. And no sign of the stain.I wouldn't want to go to the trouble of following the Time Smart Tip in the directions. There is a liquid version of the product and that should achieve the same results as the Time Smart Tip (being added to the water as it fills) with none of the fuss.The sample I received arrived with the bottom of the box broken open and the contents leaking. I have no idea if this was an isolated problem or a more general problem that Amazon have with products like this. I know from experience they have not mastered the art of packing canned goods, which often arrive dented. I wonder if they have a problem with boxed powdered goods also. I suggest that if you see the same thing mentioned in other reviews you assume it's a general problem, otherwise ignore it. Also, that may be another reason for opting for the liquid version."
5.00,"Amazingly clean for dirty, stinky clothing after a hard day of workout. I use this with the Tide Febreze Sports detergent."
4.00,"I really have a hard time just finding anytide in He I would love to find it with Febreeze"
5.00,"I live in a multifamily household. So not only do we go though a good bit of detergent but I needed something to get the sweaty guy stink out of the clothing that would also clean well enough in my HE washer. This has meet all my expectations the smell does not overpower the clothing like some of the other items I have tired and was strong enough to handle the dirt our guys produce from landscaping ,construction and mechanic work without all the pretreating I had to do before. I liked the ability to order smaller bottles for ease of use in bulk too. The case was delivered straight to my front door and I can subscribe so it comes on schedule. The only way Amazon could make it easier for me would be if it came with someone to do the wash for me."
5.00,"Just what I was expecting, I only buy tide when it is on sale, and this was a great deal"
4.00,"Tide is truly the best detergent on the market, I do love gain to and it's a few dollars cheaper than tide, but tide is definitely a more concentrated product and because of that you use less and it lasts longer. One might be scared of the price but u actual use less, I always fill up to line one only. Also nothing gets clothes cleaner than tide, the febreze scent is fresh and clean, its basically orginal tide with the scent added, but it reminds me more of orginal tide more than anything. It you value your clothes, use tide."
5.00,"Used it in every single one of my loads in Afghanistan. A high commodity among the troops, you can never send them too many. Trust me."
5.00,"My wife and I used to buy another product free of any scent because of perfumes and dyes.  They would sometimes irritate the skin.  Earlier in the fall of 2011, however, Tide with Febreze was purchased on a whim and we couldn't be happier.  Our clothes are clean and the scent is fresh, clean, and extremely long-lasting.  Furthermore, we don't seem to be affected by the ingredients/formula that make up this product."
5.00,"My husband's job requires that he remain standing all day while running around managing an entire market. When he gets home, I can smell his feet as if he just hit me across the face with his socks, but with Tide with Febreeze in it sucks away the nasty smell of his socks and leaves a gentle fresh scent which allows my stomach to stop churning! I'm a Tide-and-true fan of Tide!!!"
3.00,"For my own clothing, I have to use only fragrance-free and dye-free liquid detergents. Not that I'm a snob about it, I just have wonky skin. (I always try to buy F-Free D-Free liquid Tide when it's on sale, otherwise it's bargain brand for me.) But I must admit I have been longing for that good clean detergent fragrance. I realized that there are quite a few washable items I can still use this product on, such as curtains, blankets, outerwear, the pets' blankets, and my husband's clothing.And I did indeed like the fragrance as I took the wet items from the washer to move to the dryer. But after the dryer cycle finished, the fragrance was drastically diminished. I cannot even smell it on the freshly laundered items. Honestly, isn't the fragrance the big marketing idea behind these new detergents?I am glad to have had a chance to try a real name brand like Tide, in fact, I'd buy only Tide liquid forever if I could afford to. But I don't think I'll be buying this in the future."
4.00,"I love this stuff. My towels were not smelling so April fresh... not sour or mildew, just not fresh. This detergent did a great job of taking that odor out and leaving them with a clean smell. Much nicer than before.                                                                     I really like to wash in cold water because it seems to keep my clothes looking newer longer. This doesn't work as well in cold water as the liquid detergent, but works just fine in warm water. I recommend this to any one who likes clothes (and towels) to smell good even several days after washing."
2.00,"I received the package today. the box was about 100 times bigger than the tide. You would think i ordered a pots and pans set yet when i opened this big box, there was this small bottle of tide. for $13 i would at least expect that it would be the same size as my local stores that have it always on sale for $10 that is i believe a 64oz bottle. i will never order tide from amazon again. much better value at the local store. other than that the product smells really good and i love it."
1.00,"The day after Christmas my washer died while washing some bed sheets. So I took the sheets to my sister's house to finish the wash job. She had just bought a bottle of this soap and hadn't yet used it. I was first. After the wash I brought home the sheets to line dry like I normally do. I left them hanging for several days because of my busy work schedule. Every time I came home from work I was confronted with a powerful, nauseating and disgusting odor throughout the house - from these sheets. Think of a wet black labrador retriever dog and you've got the idea of what this smells like. Words like \"disgusting\", \"horrible\", and \"revolting\" come to mind as ways to describe the odor. I can't wait for my replacement washer to arrive so I can finally wash the stench out of these bed sheets! Meanwhile I had to store them in a spare bedroom closet. I sent an e-mail to my sister about the stink. She replied saying after she used this detergent she and her husband also found the odor to be disgusting and had to throw the rest of the bottle out."
5.00,"leaves laundry clean and smells great. i have a GE HE Harmony top loader and i use either regular or he products...when using regular detergents i only use about 3/4 the amount and works just fine. i have used full doses of regular detergent in my GE washer and have no suds problems. this Tide Febreze does come in HE but i purchased the regular by mistake ..but not a problem for me. my GE washer is 6 years old now without any problems. this happens to be one of my favorite detergents."
5.00,"Tide is a good product for washing my husband's grimy work clothes."
5.00,"Wouldn't use anything else!"
2.00,"I usually use the store brand of this product from Sam's Club. I decided to buy the Tide this time because I was in a department store and out of detergent. My daughter noticed immediately and said her clothes had a nice smell but it was too strong and she missed our regular detergent. I noticed when I washed sheets it was pretty strong for a few days. I had to wash all of my blankets, sheets and comforter due to a spill and now I am totally overwhelmed with the smell! It is a pleasant smell but just too darn overwhelming. I have a headache and can't stand it anymore. I will be re-washing all of my bedding tomorrow, in plain water, and hanging everything outside in freezing temps just to get rid of the smell! I'm going back to the generic form of this at Sam's Club."
5.00,"Love the way this detergent smells, and it has great cleaning power. The fragrance actually spreads in the area my washer/dryer is, so it's like getting a little air freshener as well!"
4.00,"I recently purchased 2Xultra Tide with Febreze (Meadows & Rain). Love the product, BUT before I could use the product, I could NOT get the lid off!! My husband tried without success! I had to bang the cap on the counter, then my husband got it off, with much effort! How would someone with poor grip or an elderly person get the lid off? This might affect whether I would buy the product again, even though I love the product! The numbers stamped on the lid are: 934317, then under that is 020616. Thank you for listening!"
5.00,"Great item."
1.00,"I pulled my clothes out of the dryer after washing them in this loathsome and horrible stuff. I thought OMG MY WASHER'S BROKE AND THERE WAS SOMETHING REALLY BAD IN THERE. Everything smelled hideous. What did it smell like? Here is the closest approximation I am capable of summoning up. And please let it be noted that I have an exceptionally adroit and sensitive olfactory system, so you can rest assured not only did this overwhelm me like some gruesome punch in the face from a sentient hell-being crawling along a New Orleans abbatoir floor in the deepest steam-midst of July but it also caused a kind of disgusting synthesis of smells to emerge in my mind: A dog vomits curdled Starbucks mochas on your clothes and they are soaked and they sit for a few days in a very warm room. No hyperbole here. This is vile and sickening. Whatever so-called soap chemist or chemical engineer brewed this nastiness up should be fired or forced to live in Satan's dirty laundry hamper with Satan's dirty socks and the odd Mastodon headed demon barfing dead offal all over the place. Don't buy this crap. EVER."
5.00,"My wife is a Tide fanatic. This is a good product.. She loves it."
5.00,"I love Tide detergents. This is my most favorite scent so far. It's mild but so fresh. I actually look forward to folding laundry just so that I can smell this scent."
2.00,"I only buy Tide, and this really helped my gym clothes smell better - I like the scent but my son DOES NOT. However, I thought something was wrong with my newer HE washer because I kept getting white streaks on my dark clothes. I called Maytag. They said it was my detergent. The Tide with Febreze is thicker, so they suggested thinning it down with hot water. Still didn't work well. Just e-mailed Tide, so I'm not sure if they will help me at all, but just a word of warning - may leave white streaks on clothes."
5.00,"This product is amazing! My clothes still smell like they just came out of the dryer days later. And even after a long day of working with some smelly animals my scrubs still smell fantastic! My favorite detergent to date. Definitely worth buying!"
5.00,"I have always loved Tide products. This is great. It just gets better and better. It smells great and it really get the job done."
5.00,"Have tried every product available and nothing could get the smell completely out of my husband's workout clothes. This product does!!! Love it!"
5.00,"i was holding my granddaugther that is a year old and she kept smelling my shirt and she would just say aaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh smell again and same thing aaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhh it was so cute but she noticed the great smell i just love tide plus febreze"
1.00,"I purchased the product to try it. I did 3 loads of laundry. I have rewashed all of the clothes with my normal product. The scent is overwhelming. It is so strong, it overpowers anything else. The worst part is that the scent isn't pleasant. I thought if it were to be strong, it would be a strong floral scent. I can't describe the scent that stays on the clothes. It is as if the soap didn't rinse off.I rewashed all of my clothes and will stick with my original product. At least I tried it! I won't be recommending it to any of my friends."
1.00,"I am very disappointed in this Tide product. I really like all the other Tide products. I will not purchase this product again due to the awful odor it gives the clothes."
5.00,"LOVE this add-in booster pak for washing clothes. I definitely notice the difference - clothes come out cleaner and smell much nicer. Always use at least 1 booster pak with each laundry load."
4.00,"Was the best at removing odor, until I tried Arm and Hammer. But it works well enough if you use a bit more than they recommend."
5.00,"This Tide has a super fresh smell and also has great cleaning power. I love that it is pre-measured and I do not have to worry about using more detergent than is needed. This is a great product and I will order it again."
5.00,"Received it this morning and put it to the test right away. Used it to wash some microfiber towels and polishing bonnets that were used in the garage to wash, wax, and puff cars. Washer was set on regular cycle with hot water wash / cold water rinse. All came out like new, all grease and other though stains were gone, colors are bright as new, and they all smell good too.                                              Excellent product, it sure past the toughest test with flying colors."
5.00,"I love the Tide with Febreze, before I committed to buying my new washer/dryer set I made sure my local store carried it in the HE type. But I am dissappointed that I have to buy it in the little bottle, PLEASE start selling it in the BIG bottle with the dispenser on the front of it!!!!"
2.00,"I am a loyal Tide fan, for years. Had to return this one. The irritating smell lingers for weeks. The \"Original\" version is also heavily scented. Though the scentless Tide HE \"Free +Gentle\" is hard to find in stores, will keep up the search. No added scent would be better by far."
5.00,"I love this product. It makes my clothes so clean and smelling fresh."
4.00,"Tide Ultra with Febreze deserves a visit to your laundry's shelf. Our family truly liked the dirt and stain removal. This helped us keep our school/work clothes longer instead of shifting them to the \"playclothes\" pile. Upon opening the dryer, our shirts emerged fresh smelling and stayed that way. Even my grimy horsey jeans lost their heavy dirt and manure smells.The only downside of this product is the potential for powder residue on the clothes. We have an HE machine and quickly discovered the recommended amount was too much for good cleaning even when followed by a proper rinse. In fact, we cut the amount by 1/3 and found cleanliness was not reduced and white powder residue was all but eliminated."
1.00,"This smelled great in the bottle but horrible when in the machine! I have used various liquid Tides for the past few years and suddenly started smelling a horrible sewer smell while washing. I figured it had something to do with my machine or pipes so I had a maintenance guy look at it and he couldn't find anything wrong. I ran bleach through, it vinegar through it and even the Tide washing machine cleaners through it and NOTHING made it go away. We were questioning if it was time to just get a new machine. As a last resort I tried a different detergent and low and behold, the smell was gone!! I don't know what it is about this particular style/scent but it was utterly horrible and made my whole house smell like a sewer. Will never use and again and I will question any other Tide products."
1.00,"I bought this online because of the package deal but when I recieved my items the laundry detergent was busted on the bottom and made a huge mess."
5.00,"This is the best detergent ever!!!!"
4.00,"Nothing I have not noticed, the conventional powder. You can wash any others say that washes strong spot, it's not true."
5.00,"Can't go wrong with this one. Overall great product. I will purchase again."
5.00,"I normally buy cheap laundry detergent. Since we move to a house, I start using tide HE liquid detergent. I totally loved it! I use only the measurement on the bottle cap. it still amaze me with that little amount of detergent can clean the entire load of clothes. We have baby and his \"like mustard stain\" waste can't get off easily just by regular washing. I wash the clothes with other detergent by hand and I still see the stain. When I put on the laundry machine using tide, everything come clean like new!The funny things is when we purchase the house, it has some kind of nice smell. we asked the seller what kind of air freshener he used. Nothing. he never used any kind of air freshener. We just finally realized that the smell must come from this detergent... what a nice addition..."
1.00,"I simply cannot wear my clothes that have been washed in this product. I have tried to get used to it but a week has gone by and it really actually seems to be getting worse...musty (yes, musty after just being pulled from the dryer and no we didn't leave the clothes in the washer overnight or wash them with anything smelly). It makes me feel sick. It's unbearable even when it's someone else in the house wearing clothes that have been washed with it! The smell is hard to describe but something like some strange chemical along with rotten flowers mixed with dirty socks. It's actually embarrassing to go out of the house smelling like this! The original scent is fine for me, but after this I think I'll go back to the Free and Clear."
5.00,"The one I like the most!"
5.00,"I ruined a pair of white jeans by washing them with coloreds and a different brand of detergent a few weeks ago, and this stuff took the stain out. Very impressed, worth paying more than the cheapo stuff."
5.00,"I received a free sample of the Sport variety a while back. Being the poor (ahem, frugal) college student I am, I've been using whatever has been on sale at the store. When I found my little sample again, I decided to give it a go. I didn't really notice anything special at first- my clothes don't typically get really dirty or stained- but when I put on my pjs, I really noticed the scent in my t-shirt. It's amazing! And my clothes are still smelling fresh today. I will definitely be purchasing Tide with Febreze from now on :)"
5.00,"I love this product. It smells great, I like to use it on my towels, sheets, and workout clothes that I don't use fabric softener on because it leaves a great scent. The only problem is I can't find it anywhere?"
2.00,"Procter and Gamble has just went crazy naming everything \"with Febreze\" because none of it actually smells like Febreze. I purchased a package of these for our gym clothes thinking they might make them stay fresh and look a little less dingy since they get worn 5-6 days a week. I threw a load in and added some Tide HE powdered detergent and a Tide Boost Febreze Victory Sport pack. The end result was awful. The clothes came out of the washer smelling like sweet pickles. It seems the Victory Sport scent is inspried by Vlasic??? It was a sweet but sour smell. Just to make sure I didn't do something wrong, I washed a load of socks with a boost pack and some Tide HE Clean Breeze powdered detergent. Same outcome... sour lingering smell. It smelled nothing like Febreze or Tide. I called the 1800 number on the bag and was told that the color safe bleach product used in the packs does have a definitive and unique scent. I would call it just gross. The offered to refund my purchase price if I sent in my receipt and barcode from the package, I gladly took them up on the offer and gave the Boost packs to the local food pantry, maybe someone could use them while tolerating the strange scent. As for their effectiveness, they seemed to do a good job at stain removal but I cannot speak to the scent removal as the pickle scent could have just been masking it. Change up the scent and I might try them again."
5.00,"I absolutely love this particular scent and it is so hard to find. I think it smells better than any of the others. Please don't tell me that they are going to not make it any more. Pleaseeeeeeee!"
1.00,"Left a strong perfume smell, then urine smell, then after more and more washes left a chemical, electrical smell! Washed four loads of my favorite expensive clothes 15x with extra rinse cycles & still has the nasuating smell locked deep into the fibers. I've had headaches from the smell & feeling sick! Febreze cant be good for the human body in my opinion... wonder what its doing to our inner organs when the detergent is absorbing through our pores to the bloodstream during a fitness class or hot yoga?? I'm thinking about throwing thousands of dollars worth of clothing that i can't find again from all my travels away. It just smells that bad. I have tried everything to get the smell out, soaking in various products. Its still there and strong. Smells up the whole house. I've been line drying and even took with me to another state for Thanksgiving to line dry at my grandmas after line drying at my friends moms. Her neighbor came over to put more clothes pins on for me & and asked what was that awful smell on my clothing, she asked if she could write Tide a letter. I've contacted proctor& gamble, they have ingredent lists for all other detergents except this one, \"the sport\" They will not tell you whats in the \"fragrence\" of the other tide febreze. And i wonder what they put in the Tide Febreze to make it sport?? Something that makes the smell stay?? Scary! I want my clothes to smell normal, i dont have a washer and drier & have spent so much money on washing and products, i can 't find these clothes again. Thought that i would just wash in this stuff once just to give them a lift. :( The polyester, nylon, spandex hold it the most, washes better out of cotton, guess i can still wear my cotton socks! If anyone knows how to get the smell out or has any recommendations please email me @ spunkyjj1@gmail.com we can talk via phone or email. Thank you and good luck as well!!"
1.00,"I have been a Tide user for 20+ years. Recently, I purchased a new washing machine that requires HE detergent. Of course, I purchased Tide HE. It is the only thing I use and is great for my sensitive nose! Unfortunately, the scent is so strong with this detergent, I can't use it. I washed one load of clothes and have had a headache since. The scent is all over my house. I will continue to purchase Tide if it is unscented."
1.00,"I have used Tide for many years and never had a problem with the way it cleans or smells. This Tide with Febreze is the worst smelling detergent I have ever used and would never recommend it. It makes my clothes smell like they were in the gym bag for months, even those that were never sweaty. Thumbs down!"
5.00,"I love Tide with Febreeze for HE machines, but would love to see the sport version in HE. I guess it hasn't come out yet?"
5.00,"My husband just started working at a company that treats railroad ties, so he comes home smelling like creosote (yuck!). Tide Sport takes the odors away!"
5.00,"I accidently purchased this prodcut not knowing it was the high efficient type. But it's been no problem in my normal washing machine... just has less suds with the same cleaning power."
4.00,"This is a boost only, not detergent. That can be a bit confusing. You still need to add detergent to the boost. The boost helps with heavy sports dirty cloths - i.e. if it stinks from football or baseball practice, this really helps. In all honesty, I'm not sure the boost is worth it. It works, your laundry will smell good - just not sure you need the extra help."
4.00,"The Boost is a great combination with the Tide Pods for a added boost to the colors and help in removal of stains."
4.00,"Me and my boyfreind both used this detergent because it smells so great! Unfortunately on 2 separate occasions, in 2 different washing machines, it turned the armpits of our white T-shirts different colors! His turned Red, and mine Black. I do not recommend washing anything white with this detergent."
1.00,"This was my favorite product until they stopped making the green lable rain scent. The purple is horrid.Why did you stop making it?"
2.00,"I purchased this thinking it was laundry detergent... it is something you ADD to your regular detergent to \"boost\" its cleaning power."
5.00,"I typically avoid launddry powder because sometimes they don't dissolve well and dark clothes end up with white smears.  When I use powder, I let the washer fill wiht some water first and dump the detergent in.  Sometimes I'll pour half in the bottom and the other half in the top of the load.  Either way, I've never had a problem with this detergent.  It dissolves well, and it comes with a slightly smaller cup so you don't use as much.  The Febreze scent isn't as strong as the liquid formulation, but I still like it. I've washed 10 loads of laundry with this, and so far so good."
5.00,"I like light scents. I want a little fragrance -- nothing too fruity or flowery or girly. This is exactly what this product delivers. There's a smell that says \"fresh\" but it isn't overpowering.                                                                     If that's what you're looking for, you should pick some of this up.                                                                     I'm a devotee of Tide. It always seems to do a superlative job of cleaning. Consumer Reports has advocated that it is great value vs. the cleaning one gets in cheaper products and I believe this. (Although, to be honest, it isn't as if I've done some all-inclusive comparison.)"
5.00,"I love TIDE with Frebreze. The spring and renewal scent is just wonderful! It of course lives up to its name. The actilift does seem to get out stains better also. Can't beat the price with free shipping for amazon prime. I recommend Tide to everyone! The cheap detergent is not worth buying!"
1.00,"tried Tide Febreze Sport and found it smelled awful, then left blue stains! I got the stains out the first time since I hadn't dried it yet, but the next time dried the clothes and ruined 3 items. Tide told me to wash it in hot water, but the stains are still there. My clothes were ruined, changing from tide after 30 years..."
1.00,"WalMart sent part of my order but not this item. I would like a refund if they can't deliver."
1.00,"Shop at Amazon whenever I can because its just easier. Sadly this product is cheaper at my local grocery store, even allowing for tax"
1.00,"I love Tide but Tide Sport makes the clothes smell and can't wear them because they stink. I now switch between Tide w/ Downy and Tide Total Care and I love the smell and seems to be working with keeping my clothes clean. I won't use Tide Sport again. Maybe Tide should offer small trial bottles for new products so they can be tried first instead of wasting money on a product that doesn't end up working. Just a thought"
1.00,"This product is awful unless you truly love the smell of this detergent. I mean really love the smell. I have had multiple people tell me that I smell like incense after using this detergent. I told them it's my clothes. They could rub their fingers on my shirt and the smell stuck right to their fingers. I tried double rinsing my clothes, but the scent remains. It has taken 2 washes w/ scent free detergent to rid my clothes of this horrid smell."
1.00,"The febreze fragrance in this product smells like a fragranced deodorant and perspiration mix together once the deodorant is no longer working. A lot of individuals that have not found a deodorant that works or is effective all day smell like this product. I do not like it and feel like I stink and my clothes stink. I can't wait to buy another Tide (I do love Tide!). This was the only one available in the large size at the store that night and I thought, \"why not, it has Febreze\". Big regret...can't wait till the product is all gone. My family does not like the fragrance either. Again, I love Tide and will continue to buy Tide."
3.00,"i received this product as if it had been on the shelves for awhile it was all clumpy and the pods were leaking not at all satisfied witht the condition of this product upon reciept. overall it works great i am sure if it was fresh it would work better"
5.00,"The Tide tablets work exactly as described. I like the way these work more than the regular Tide liquid detergent. I definitely will buy more of these once my bag runs out."
5.00,"Wow, paid less than a dollar to have this big heavy bottle of Tide sent to my home - it would have cost me more than that in gas to go pick it up, not to mention the time saved! Thanks Walmart!"
3.00,"It is heard to determine if using additional tide boost pods really makes a difference when washing with tide pods. Tide pods alone usually do the job of cleaning clothing. perhaps maybe i will just use boost alone to see if there a variable worth noting. Until then Tide Pod is adequate for a good wash."
5.00,"I havent recieved my order from amazon yet but I do always use this product. I love tide with febreze, the spring and renewal scent is mild but smells clean. I love the scent on my bed sheets, its a very relaxing ting to smell when you come home from a long day. I have always used tide and tried many scents but I always come back to this one."
1.00,"I never had a problem with allergies and/or detergents but I have had a horrible reaction to this product. After several days of trying to figure out what was causing the massive hives all over my body. I finally had an ah huh moment.. Now Im rewashing tons of clothes in vinegar trying to element the damages. Never again. I cant even touch it."
5.00,"Just GREAT for all the athletic grimy gym, football, hot yoga, lacrosse stinky smells and stains that just don't seem to come out with other det.'s Still that same great Tide result as far as getting things really clean, just really great at getting bad BO out too."
4.00,"I've used Tide for years and appreciate the job it does. I also use the Cold Water Tide for colors and like it as well. The only request I have is to PLEASE consider bringing back the White Lilac scent. It was so soothing and fresh. Company always commented on how good their towels and sheets smelled, even after months in the cupboard."
5.00,"I love the scent and cleaning ability of this product! Just one problem....I just had to buy a new washer, and it's an HE....I cannot find the HE version of this detergent in the stores that are local to me :( So, I had to go back to the regular-works well but doesn't smell as nice Tide with Bleach Alternative :( But, I'll keep on looking! Thanks for a great product!"
4.00,"I have a lot of UnderArmour and Nike \"technical\" running shirts (read: sweat wicking). I've tried everything to get it back to not smelling like I just ran 5 miles at an 8:36 pace. One pod and a spoonful of ProWash ( B001EJMY46 and clothes smell fresh. A little like Febreeze, but not like I ran 5 miles, either."
1.00,"I love Tide with Lavender but with Febreze it smells like medicine! Take the Febreze out and just make it with Lavender scent.Won't buy this again sorry"
5.00,"i love the way tide febreze smell it just makes you feel good all over and the way the world is now that is a poisitive thing."
1.00,"I have been using tide products for years, and generally, have been pleased. I must comment on the very strange, lingering smell of tide he with febreeze laundry detergent. My best description would be that of cat urine, and yes, I know how that smells, being a cat owner. the smell lingers.It smells our closet and even overwhelms colognes, I am embarrassed to wear these clothes, and am going to have to rewash them. Even my husband,who doesnt even know when I cut 4 inches of hair or move furniture around, noticed and complained, as did our twelve year old daughter. I have two large bottles of this stuff and wont be using it. Is there anyway to get my money back?"
1.00,"I bought this stuff because my gym clothes were starting to not smell so fresh after washing. I made the mistake of doing my first load of it on my sheets and it was absolutely horrible. It is just so strong and powerful that I felt like I couldn't breathe, needless to say I did not get a good nights rest until the next night when I rewashed them...I tried it out later on my gym clothes and while it worked at getting the odor out, I would rather smell my b.o. than this stuff!!! It's that terrible! I asked 3 different people to smell the laundered clothes and everyone agreed that it smelled sour or just way too strong."
5.00,"This detergent is wonderful. Like the other reviewers, it is very difficult to find this product. I would love to see it in the larger size. The small 50 oz and 100 oz, do not cut it. Please consider your consumers feedback and start producing it in a larger size."
5.00,"Thanks TIDE, for your wonderful product!"
2.00,"I've been a Tide user for years and this is the first time I've ever had ANY type of problem with one of their detergents. The scent on this one has a seriously \"OFF\" note to it. and what's worse, I think everyone around me knows it. Ever had someone ask \"is that a new perfume/cologne???....\" and then have their voice trail off and say nothing else - then you know that scent is probably NOT workin' for ya. Sorry to say but I agree with the other one star review, that this scent does leave a sort of \"pukey\", slightly rancid undertone. Not in the bottle but definitely on the clothes. I'm not talking about washing sports gear or anything that started out smelly or gross, just normal household wash. The smell does not just go away on its own either, even if the clothes sit in a drawer for a month. The only way to get the smell out is to re-wash the clothes. Bottom line: I had to stop using this product and waste a nearly full container. Love the brand/detergent in general though so I'll continue to buy Tide, just in a different scent."
1.00,"We purchased this after smelling it in the store. It smelled pretty decent and we were looking for something different. This stuff makes your clothes smell horrible!!! Others have commented that it makes your clothes smell like perfumed sweat but we have lots of pets and this stuff will make your clothes smell like they were washed in cat piss!"
5.00,"Recently I have become a new mother and even though I love this product it has become out of the budget even with the dollar off coupon. I miss my clothes smelling that wonder clean smell. If the cost of the item went down or if I could get better coupons the Tide plus Febreze would be in my laundry room all the time!"
3.00,"I love the smeal, Of Tide with Febreze Sport.But mi color's look terrible, after I used."
5.00,"My boyfriend of 5 years has very a strong b.o. Ive tried everything from washing laundry with baking soda to oxi-clean, the smell still stayed. Now that I have bought this new HE washing machine it was time to switch our detergent.I was so happy when Tide plus febreze freshness along with the tide in wash booster packs removed all the smell from his clothes. He says \"It smells like a girl, but that's good!\" Thank u tide for making a great product. I also use both to wash my puppy blankets.. There are no unwanted sents from her kennel. thanks again."
5.00,"I am a busy mom of 4 and am going to nursing school. Let me tell you, I am not the most attentive to stains right now. This leaves our clothes smelling great and it gets thoses unknown stains out. Love It !"
5.00,"Having washed clothes, using Tide products, for a huge family for years, I can honestly say \"Tide\" has helped me to have the cleanest appearing and nicest smelling clothes ever for my family. It made washing piles of laundry not an unpleasant chore."
5.00,"Wonder why your getting that bad smell from your HE machine? Why look at the bottle! this isn't for HE machines! Wow! Would you look at that! They make a tide sport for he machines. Geeez get the right product you wouldn't have a problem! This product works great in a regular washing machine!"
5.00,"I love the scent and it boosts the detergent. My clothes are very clean with this additive. I recommend this product. The price is great too"
4.00,"i love tide i wish it would make more suds though if it did it would be a 5 star product/"
4.00,"I love the freshness and quality of Tide. It does a awesome job at getting my cloths clean and smelling great"
5.00,"After receiving this product have been using it ever since, it's that good. I use only three cups for my laundry with the crystals and it last still my next wash. This is a fabulous item and will continue to use because it leaves no film, greasy spots only a fresh smell. Tide is the best with outer and under garments stain and odor removals. A True gem!"
1.00,"My son has sensitive skin and had a pretty bad allergic reaction to this product, hives in numerous places. Ill make it clear we have narrowed it down to it possibly being this product but can not be 100% positive. Contacted tide regarding it and they were sorry it happened . If you have skin sensitivity to scents etc i would avoid this product."
5.00,"Love this product; closet smells wonderful, enjoy ironing clothes again. Hope they keep it available for ever."
1.00,"I was double-washing my laundry because the overwhelming, chemical-smelling odor was so bad. I finally realized it was the Febreze Freshness odor of the Tide laundry detergent that was causing the problem. I would highly recommend that Tide discontinue this fragrance."
5.00,"I had not been a fan of tide scents until I tried the tide plus febreze seaside fresh. It is truly my favorite detergent. My clothes smell soooo fresh, and the scent lasts all day. LOVE this product."
5.00,"Love the fact that I have this on hand when I need it - No mess with a box that you have to keep up with the measuring cup or a big bottle that drips whenever you measure. I have a subscription so I never run out which is great when I decide to go on a whole house cleaning binge! - Best part - clean fresh smelling laundry - now if I could subscribe to a folding service life would be complete"
5.00,"Just as described. And there was a special at the time so I got them at a great price too. Thanks!"
5.00,"other products you buy tou have to use twice the usual amount and it can not beat the performance of tid so why save less to pay more that is bassicaly what you are doing the tide will go 3 times longer then those cheaper brands it gives the freshness that is out of this world that lastest for days and days and the cleaning performance to me you can not beat i have used several different brands and they cannot add up to the value of tide my rating would have to be 10 on the tide"
2.00,"This could be just me and I normally love the smell of Febreze, but I absolutely hate the smell of this detergent with Febreze. Whenever I used it, I felt like my entire house had this sickening sweet smell. I gave up after 2 loads."
5.00,"I think it goes without mentioning that I'd recommend this product to a friend."
4.00,"I decided to try this product on a lark despite the fact that my household has always used liquid detergents previously (although it is the same brand we usually buy).  I have to say that I am not disappointed with the decision.  The only reason I did not give this product a full 5 stars is that the scoop was buried at the bottom of the box, requiring one to make a mess of oneself with detergent trying to get the scoop out.  As a detergent, this works great.  The Febreeze in the formulation leaves a pleasant, but not overpowering, scent on the finished laundry. We've also found that we don't need to use a whole scoop of detergent to get our laundry clean and smelling good, so though the box says it is good for 63 loads, we should easily get 100+ loads out of it, which is good for the environment and our wallets."
5.00,"I love using the Tide Boost tabs in my laundry. They have an amazing scent too. They get my whites whiter and I love this product. It is great for white dress shirts, socks and all your whites. I recommend this product"
5.00,"This is an excellent cleaning agent that is highly concentrated. As a bonus, it has a perfumed scent. Instead of the classic laundry scent, this version of Tide has a light floral aroma. Unlike many detergents with added scents, the floral aroma lasts, leaving clothing, towels and linen smelling fresh and good.Not only does this version of Tide smell good, it is an effective stain remover. I very recently had company and somebody had spilled wine on a tablecloth. This detergent not only removed the stain, but all evidence that it was even there.My towels and linen smell fresh and clean and look pristine. I highly recommend this product. It also does a bang up job on white wash, leaving your white items fresh, crisp and very clean!"
5.00,"I have been using liquid detergent for the past few months. I live in a humid area and the last box of powder detergent I bought clumped up really bad. So far I have not experienced any clumping with this brand.                                                                     I have used Tide in the past. I buy detergent by the scent or price. Sometimes if the scent is too good to put down and cost more, it wins. I have to say I am very impressed with the smell of this detergent. It smells very fresh. Tide has always made my clothes look new and is great at getting stains that are not set in. I think Tide is known for that.                                                                     The best combination with this detergent is to use                                                . I think it compliments the wash very well and the clothes come smelling so fresh out of the dryer and static free!                                                                     I think I will continue to buy this. It has such a refreshing scent I look forward to doing the laundry and folding it now."
4.00,"The shipping weight for this product is listed as 182 POUNDS, and shipping is at $85 for one container of this. There is no way to change it, don't bother putting it in your shopping cart until they change it."
5.00,"This product has two of the best products in one! Tide for cleaning the luandry and febreeze to keep it fresh scented."
1.00,"Item ordered was Tide High Efficency laundry detergent. Order was placed for 2 boxes of 2 bottles. One box was the correct item. the second box was labled incorrectly and was Not what was ordered. Rather than fight the hassle, we just donated the wrong box of tide to a shelter. Attention needs to be paid to products with similar names but different usages. Regular tide is NOT the same as Tide HE. Your crew needs to read and lable more effectively. DO NOT stick the scan lable items on the product until the item has been checked to make sure it is what is in the box."
3.00,"Tide cleans well but the scent is not agreeable to me. You really do need to use less and that is nice."
5.00,"This detergent is my favorite, I love putting on a fresh shirt and shorts/pants after a shower. And with Tide with Febreze Sport Active it retains the pleasant scent even after a workout. Very pleased that This scent of Tide is available. I will go out of my way to find it."
5.00,"I absolutely love this. I use it in every load of clothes. It gets the stains and helps gets my clothes more cleaner than just putting detergent and fabric softer in the load. I would recommend this to anyone"
5.00,"I've struggled for years with clothes that stink. Countless washes in cheap, watered-down laundry detergents did little to remove the odors accumulated from my daily activities. Walking the dog, cleaning the house, and even watching television left my garments smelling funky. That was until I encountered Tide with Febreze Freshness High Efficiency Spring and Renewal Scent with Actilift. Cookies and cream ice cream stains were ghosted out from my favorite moo moo, spaghetti sauce was somehow lifted from my sports bra, and the double tall, half-caff, extra whip, low foam, triple espresso, no sugar coffee spot was no longer visible on my pair of dollar store shorts. And I smelled like a waterfall that unicorns drink from in the middle of a forest that's inhabited by fairies. There are some things worth splurging on in life. Make Tide with Febreze Freshness High Efficiency Spring and Renewal Scent with Actilift one of them."
4.00,"Excellent soap and strong lasting fragrance. The laundries were cleaned. Would give it 5 stars but it is a little expensive."
5.00,"I love using Tide but have trouble finding HE in the powder. My grandmother used Tide, my mother used Tide and I've used for as long as I've washed clothes."
1.00,"The smell is fantastic from the bottle and it does wash out tough odors but it replaces the odor with almost a chicken soup smell. I'm trying different amounts and different softeners too but the smell is too strong."
5.00,"Same great cleaning power you would expect from a Tide product but with a really great, fresh scent that isn't overpowering as some can be. Tide and Febreze--how can you go wrong with that combination!!"
5.00,"This is an excellent product. It does what it says, and 'boosts' the cleaning power of your detergent. And I love the packaging. No measuring, or inconvenience. Just grab one of those little pods and throw it in the machine."
4.00,"This product is great for getting out those tough stains on clothes that you really like without the hassle of having to reload the washer for a second time. However i would highly recommend using it in conjunction with oxi-clean or Resolve Laundry Stain Remover, Original Trigger, 30 Ounce (Pack of 3) which is a pre-treater. Also this MUST be used with your regular detergent and is not to be replaced with but rather used with Pods, Liquid or Powder Detergent. I personally use these with Tide Pods and my clothes come out great every time. The only problem is, I'm not sure if I can tell if there is any Febreze within the capsule. However, besides that, the product works masterfully and I would recommend it to anyone willing to get rid of nasty stains easily. I hope this helps)"
3.00,"Although I have a deep love of both Tide and Febreze, the concept together for me somehow does not work. Clothes were clean as they should be but the scent did not last past the wash. The detergent was in a powder form and was hard to dissolve in the water versus the liquid detergent. The box could be designed better, easier to open and dispense product.I recommend using regular Tide with a Febreze scented dryer sheet. I was hoping this would be the perfect solution for towels and sheets but in the end it was just like using any regular detergent."
5.00,"I simply love this detergent! It cleans my clothes and leaves a lasting clean scent! I only wish Tide sold it in the jumbo size!"
5.00,"THERE IS NOTHING BETTER THAN TIDE NO MATTER WHAT THEY ADD TO IT."
5.00,"I LOVE this product.. I try to do a load of laundry a day just so I can smell it! I dont know what I would do if you ever stopped selling it! LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!!!!!!"
5.00,"I put this product to the test right away by using it to clean a sweatshirt stained with fresh pine sap and a towel with baby poop on it, amongst a full load of laundry.  I was most worried about the white towel stained with funky colored baby poop.  Nothing to worry about.  It cleaned the towel so there was no noticable stains and it smelled fresh coming out of the machine.  The pine sap was also removed from my sweatshirt.  The entire load of laundry smelled fresh.  I only used a small amount, less than recommended, because I have a high efficiency washing maching and this was not HE approved detergent.  I have used it for about 6 loads thus far and have been impressed enough that I will recommend people use this product."
5.00,"This product smells absolutely wonderful. The bath towels and your clothes have a clean smell that lasts longer than any other detergent I have ever used. I am hooked for life on this product. I will never use another laundry detergent. It may cost a little bit more than the cheaper brands, but its well worth it."
5.00,"I use this whenever i was my workout clothes or my boyfriend's work clothes (he works in food service). It gets the stains out and removes that awful \"sweat\" smell. However, it does not completely get the greasy food smell out of my boyfriend's work uniform. Honestly, I don't think anything can without destroying the fabric. However, it does get those caked-on grease-ridden stains out better than detergent alone. And it does somewhat mask the smell in his uniform even though it doesn't completely get rid of it. I'll take that incremental improvement any day!"
5.00,"I love this stuff! I am very sensitive to smells, especially that \"mildew\" smell. i bought this initially for my husband's and my workout clothes, but i love it so much I use it on everything. It is great for towels, sheets, everything. I am a laundry fanatic, so I probably wash stuff more often than it needs, and my clothes still seem to look and feel great after washes and washes (especially the workout ones). I think this product is a value (I use to use Penguin, but it was significantly more expensive and not nearly as effective.)"
4.00,"I have been using powdered Tide for years; this is my first venture into the liquid Tide, and, so far, I am happy with it. It is pretty mild, so I wouldn't try to clean grease or real heavy embedded dirt from clothes, but for just gentle cleaning (especially when my wife does her laundry as she never really gets anything really dirty), this works just fine. It was very reasonable (a couple of 50 ounce containers for around ten plus bucks--and shipping was free for me through Amazon Prime), so I think it is a good quality product, reasonable in price, and works for what it was made for. (And it is even made in the USA, these days you never know.)"
4.00,"I've been using this particular type of Tide for the past couple years. Before that, I had used the regular liquid Tide for many years as my \"go to\" laundry detergent. Can't say that I've gone wrong using Tide products. This version, with Febreze, is a product that works for me. The Febreze adds a note of freshness (or so it seems to me, anyhow); it seems to help get rid of odors in dirty clothing. In fact, I have some spray Febreze handy, alongside the Tide, and often shoot a bit of that onto the dirty clothes before I start the washer. So, I have been using Tide for a long time to wash clothes, and this product works well for me. I am not inbclined, at this time, to look to another brand of laundry detergent."
5.00,"I love this stuff! Unlike so many other scented laundry cleaners or fabric softeners, this stuff really does last! There is nothing better than feeling like your inside of a commercial, picking up your favorite sweater and having it smell wonderful *days* after you last washed it! Keep up the good work, Tide!"
5.00,"I love this scent!! I am always getting compliments from my friends and coworkers about how good my clothes always smell. I pair it with Downy with Febreeze and Bounce with Febreeze for the extra scent. My clothes always come out smelling and looking great. I refuse to buy anything else. Keep up the great work!!"
5.00,"These work just as well as the Tide Stain Release In Wash Boosters. I was put off by the smell in the pack (it was reminiscent of flowery grass)and dismayed that I didnt listen to reviewers when they said this smells horribly. But, my clothes came out clean and fresh with only a slight scent from the pods. It was much nicer after the clothes had dried. It worked incredibly well on my whites and my daughter's uniforms. It didnt leave any residue. You use one per wash. You lay the pack right on top of your clothes. Once the pack was slightly crushed and open and when I used it in the wash I did see residue on my clothing, so make sure to use correctly. It was an incredible bargain at half off and I wouldnt hesitate to buy them for full price."
5.00,"I LOVE LOVE LOVE this scent! However, whoever packed it had packed 1 of the bottles upside down and about half the bottle leaked out by the time it got to me. The box that it came in was also too flimsy for such a heavy item. 2 other bottles had crease dents on them. Contacted Amazon who resolved the issue promptly."
5.00,"always love this product, I like the fact that it was secured to keep the product from spilling"
5.00,"I bought this so I could not only clean my clothes but trade it like cash.It gets my clothes so clean and they smell great.My dealer always comments on clothes and often he wants my tide in trade."
1.00,"I loved Tide's Simple Pleasures Lavender detergent (we don't use softener), which has become impossible to find in my area, but don't like mountain or meadow scents, so I thought I'd give this a whirl for my gym clothes, sheets and dirty socks. I'm very sorry I did. I only get one day a week off to do laundry and I'm going to have to re-wash all of it. Tide with Febreze Sport smells fine in the bottle, but it made my sheets and clothing smell overwhelmingly, horribly sour. I literally became nauseous and my husband and I both got substantial headaches, which we've never been prone to. I can't recommend regular Tide enough, but approach this stuff with extreme caution!"
5.00,"It leaves my clothes really clean NAND it smells good.."
1.00,"I can't get pass the scent. It didn't get out all of the sweaty odor like I hoped. It's not worth the price."
5.00,"i knew that the products was exceptioal but the speed in which my order was processed and shipped was also exceptiona."
5.00,"I love Tide and I love Febreze,and I love them even more together. The Febreze scent is nice and not too perfumey, which is what I was mildly concerned about initially. I was also concerned the scent might clash with my fabric softener, which it doesn't. I have used Downy, Snuggle and Gain fabric softeners (I like to switch my fabric softeners) and there is no clashing of scents or heavy perfumey smells. Tide works just as well as it always has with the Febreze. I am a happy camper."
5.00,"I train Brazilian Jiu Jitsu at least four days a week and I lift weights two days a week. Tide Febreze Sport is the only detergent I've found that will completely eliminate body odor from dry fit and lycra (rash guards, compression shorts, etc.). It also helps that I legitimately enjoy the scent as well. I completely recommend this."
4.00,"If you like Tide detergent, you are going to love this product! The Febreze smell is great and it is combined into one nifty product that gives you great-smelling and clean clothes. If, however, strong smells get to you, you may want to try a detergent that doesn't have quite the strong odor that this one does. My family loves it!"
5.00,"I love how clean this stuff leaves your clothes. I definitely will be buying more!!! So happy and the price was well worth it!"
2.00,"I bought this product the other day because it smelled really good! I washed and dried my clothes, took a sniff and it was not good, it smells like sweaty clothes that were sprayed with berry-ish scented perfume. I tried it a few more times and it was just awful. Took a few washes to get the smell completely out. You are better off spraying your clothes with febreze. Luckily that same day i bought Tide with bleach alternative, which smells much better when dry."
5.00,"My hubby did contractor work years ago when I was 'branding' during our first years together. Tide didn't make the cut back then for Manly Man odors and I never gave it another try. Until I saw this Tide/Febeeze last week in the grocery store. There is a lot of square footage open to my laundry room and every inch is freshened while the wash is in! The blanket I washed last week is still incredibly fresh and that's with a 3 yr old boy and a puppy snuggling up in it daily. Before, you couldn't let the laundry sit for more than a few hours before it started to funk and now it smells fresh and clean even when forgotten for a bit longer :) No great stain remover, i still have to pretreat the little guy's clothes but, seriously, try it. And please Tide, more scents!"
5.00,"was always using cheap landry soap...tried this tide and ill never go back. yes its more expensive but it makes your clothes/blankets smell so good for days/weeks"
1.00,"Not sure how others are getting good results from this product, unless top loaders are getting different result!"
1.00,"Product itself is good the only thing it is highly overpriced, you can buy 160 oz in Costco for the same price"
5.00,"I have never loved a product as much as Tide Febreze. I have a dog that sleeps with me every night and I washed my comforter with this product and even after 2 weeks since the comforter has been washed I wake up every morning and say, \"I can't believe this comforter still smells this GREAT!!!\"Also, I workout every day and my clothes were getting to the point where they just never smelled clean after washing them. After using Tide Febreze it is AMAZING how fresh they smell.This is the best detergent ever!!!!"
5.00,"What my clothes really needed this time of year! Tide is always a hit with me, so no surprise I wouldn't love this one! I really loved how fresh my clothes smelled but my clothes looked that way too! This was the perfect way to kick off spring with renewal and an excellent product to purchase. I am going to have to get myself a bigger box.                                                                     I will recommend this to everyone, we all love smelling and looking our best don't we!"
5.00,"I absolutely love the Tide Ultra with Febreeze Freshness Spring and Renewal Scent Powder.  The clothes I washed with it turned out great.  Set in stains were removed and the clothes were left with a very subtle but nice scent.  At first I was afraid that the Febreeze would make the Tide too scented, but Tide did a great job in making the sent light but nice.  I highly recommend this product."
5.00,"I really like the scent and ability to clean my workout clothes. It leave them nice smelling even if I don't use fabric softener or dryer sheets."
5.00,"I had my dogs out in the country and they cornered a skunk. Unfortunately I was downwind and ended up skunked too. Before I threw out my clothes I tried washing them in Tide with Fabreze. After one wash the smell, and it was some smell, was gone. I can't think of a better testimonial."
5.00,"I bought HE Tide Sport and I love it! It makes my laundry smell great. I've tried all sorts of other HE detergents, but have not found any that compete with Tide."
4.00,"Products work to clean very dirty clothing! Comes out with no smell no matter how smelly the clothes is prior!"
5.00,"This goes my clothes very clean, smells good and was a good deal at Walmart."
5.00,"Ultra Tide plus Febreeze had my clothes looking like new and smelling better than when I first bought them. The new Ultra Tide product is great and does more work for less product. Most people already know that Tide makes the best laundry detergent (at least I think that) and this new version ensures that your clothes will get as clean as humanely possible by detergent and for less cost.It is less cost because you get to use less detergent in each wash!! I highly recommend Ultra Tide."
5.00,"I LOVE THE SCENT OF THE TIDE WITH FEBREEZE. THE SPRING RENEWAL KIND WAS THE BEST ONE. I JUST LOVE THE WAY IT MADE MY CLOTHES SMELL. AWESOME PRODUCT!!!!!!"
5.00,"I'm a 3rd generation Tide user in my family (mama & granny b4 me). Without a doubt, Tide is hands down the most superior detergent on the market. Almost any stains and all odors are completely eliminated with this brand. With the addition of Febreeze, your laundry room and any room within its vicinity will have a wonderful aroma throughout your wash day. I swear that my coworkers line up to hug and sniff me more often after switching to Tide HE w/Febreeze! It is not necessary to ever fill the cap to the limit with Tide HE w/febreeze. You must know that this is a highly concentrated detergent for use in low water washers (High Efficiency). If you over use this detergent, you'll not only waste your money; but also ruin your clothes. Yes, your clothes will eventually develop holes and shred. I've also reduced the amount of Clorox bleach (chlorine) by 1/3 because Tide HE has better cleaning ability on whites. So, my entire point is look no further if you want a detergent that actually cleans thouroughly and imparts a very fragrant aoma on your clothes and household."
5.00,"This is not for normal clothing or your sheets or things of similar nature. I am a pretty serious Judo player, and my Judo uniform gets a level of disgusting normal clothing, even exercise wear, can not obtain. It is sweat in, bled on, and literally dragged all over the floor for hours every day. I was having a very hard time trying to keep to clean -- an important point with such close and constant human contact. I had tried pretty much everything with very limited success - until Tide Sport. It works great! So well in fact that I have received many compliments and inquiries about how my uniform smells so good. The smell is not disgusting as other reviewers have suggested, it smells fantastic, and not too strong. I can only assume their problems arise from using a) too much on b) lightly soiled items."
5.00,"This is by far the best scent. Please make it in the larger size and HE."
5.00,"thanks!!!"
5.00,"thanks!!!"
5.00,"Tide, to me, is like the king of laundry detergents. It does the job, does it very well, and smells great! Now with Febreze Freshness Spring and Renewal Scent, only adds an already fine detergent. I really like the scent it leaves behind on my clothes and bed sheets. It's pretty without being overpowering and it lasts! Good stuff all around. I gladly recommend it."
1.00,"My husband recently purchased this product - HE Sport with Febreze (black cap). After a couple of loads of laundry, our clothes started to smell terrible. I thought that perhaps our front loading machine had retained some mold from washing towels. No such luck. After cleaning with Affresh, Borax, Vinegar, the smell remained. I noticed while doing hot yoga, what I thought to be body odor! I was embarassed as I never thought it could be the detergent. I couldn't take it anymore since now our towels and bed linens were stinking too. I went back to our old Tide HE and the smell disappeared. I don't usually write reviews good or bad, but thought it imperative that somebody know how bad this stuff smells. Be glad you can't find it in the store. You aren't missing anything."
1.00,"This item was being sold by Wal-Mart under a different name. First they shipped me the wrong item (era laundry detergent) then the lady that was helping me was very rude and acted like it was my fault for receiving the wrong product. Love the detergent but it was a miserable experience getting the product that I ordered."
5.00,"This detergent is great. It leaves my family's clothes clean and smelling great. I will buy it again!"
1.00,"very watery, not like other products for HE machines. Will not purchase again."
5.00,"OK, I have been complaining lately on this website about the scent of liquid Tide original scent since the Acti Lift was added to the formula. That scent is bitter and horrible. I have spent a lot of money trying other Tide scents and have not liked any of them until I tried Tide plus Frebreze Seaside Fresh. I love this smell.I tried the Tide plus Febreze Spring & Renewel and did not like that one at all. It smelled like bubble gum. I kept trying different Tide scents since Tide is the best detergent on the market. It's a shame they ruined the other scents with the Acti Lift , but the Seaside Fresh smells wonderful. Please don't change this one. I wish it came in bigger bottles to make it more cost effective and was available in more stores. I can only find it in one store in my area.For the record, I am not one to write reviews on any product, but I felt compelled to voice my opinion about Tide."
5.00,"My son like's to wash with tide so do I that's all that I use at home !!!"
5.00,"Contrary to what other reviews might say, there is no 64 oz bottle of Tide. There hasn't been in, what, 10 years? So yeah, same bottle at the store, occasionally at a great price here. Nothing cleans as well as Tide, in my opinion, but the Kirkland (Costco) natural stuff is fantastic for things like towels and darks. No optical brighteners, so it won't fade your clothes like most other detergents will. But I do like to use this Tide on my whites."
5.00,"I love Tide for the way it keeps colors bright, and whites white.  It really does get the stains out.  I have a 5 year old who goes out of her way to find mud and messes.  I can always count on Tide to get her clothes looking clean &amp; new again.                                                                     The new concentrated formula means I use less Tide, which uses less space in my house.  YaY!                                                                     The Febreeze means my clothes smell WONDERFUL!  You know the commercial where the lady shoves her face in the carpet because Febreeze smells THAT good?  You'll do this with your clothes. You just want to keep on smelling them!"
2.00,"I love Tide, but I did not find these to be good. Let me explain, My clothing was clean, like Tide always does, but one or two articles would have a gummy residue where the little ball didn't quite melt all the way. It may be because I have a front loading HE washing machine, but the product says that it works for these machines. I was really frustrated after using nearly the whole bag as it happened every single time. I wound up giving the last few to my daughter, who has a top loading HE machine and has no problems with these."
5.00,"I needed more detergent so I decided to try this one as they were out of the \"sport\" variety.                                              And.....it's just as good as the \"sport\" kind just not as overpowering in the scent department.                                              It's relatively cheap, lasts a long time, and gets my clothes squeaky clean.                                              Anything bad to say?                                              Nah, its Tide with Febreeze......can't go wrong with that combo.                                              Recommended."
5.00,"Smells great & works well. :-)"
5.00,"I just love the smell of the Seaside Fresh detergent... I use it every time I wash laundry!! It makes my clothes smell so good, with some other laundry detergents your clothes don't smell good after being washed.. With this detergent my clothes smell good even after being dried... I've used numerous brands of laundry detergent, this one is the best one I've found... I would recommend this product to anyone!!!"
5.00,"I always get complements on how fresh my clothes smell."
5.00,"One of my friends recommended me to buy this one, yep, I will recommend it to my other friends!"
5.00,"I purchased this for the first time. My Nephew/son MJ is into every sport there is. I tried it for the extra kick they said Febreze adds. Well it did and it does do exactly what it needed. Tide is the best laundry detergent ever made."
4.00,"This detergent cleans well and smells so good. It is hard to find in stores in my area but I think there are a few who carry this one. I would have given 5 stars but it takes too long to receive it from Walmart.com so it's a lot faster for me to just go to Walmart in my town and get it myself."
5.00,"This is the only detergent I use in my household since Tide introduced the public with Frebreze Sport!The active ingredient in this detergent cleans very well and the extra bonus of the fresh scent makes me want to wash my bedroom sheets everyday! I love it!"
1.00,"1 STAR because it ruined some of my favorite workout clothes. I love Frebreze products for freshening the air, auto, or upholstery. However, this stuff is not right for cleaning clothes. I washed some sweaty gym clothes with this stuff and I had to throw them away. Even after washing two or three times, I can still smell the \"scent\" of Frebreze in my clothes. I think this is a different formulation than the Frebreze you're familiar with. This \"scent\" makes me gag. It's not good. I have even had the scent transfer to other clothes on the second wash (washing clothes that have not been washed with Frebreze with clothes that were previously washed with Frebreze. This stuff if very strong and permeates everything that it touches. I tried cutting the recommended usage down by 1/2 and 1/4. That helps, but then you do not get effective cleaning. It's not just me. My family can even smell it and they hate it. I have had to throw away hundreds of dollars of good workout clothes because they were ruined. You can find other products out there there are better than this stuff."
5.00,"Is worth it, the price is good and this is the laundry detergent I always use."
4.00,"Let me start off by saying I have A LOT of clothes.  I don't like to wear the same thing very often which unfortunately leads to large amounts of laundry.  Throw in a slobbering messy dog and that guarantees that I cycle through plenty of clothes on a weekly basis.  I tend to take care of my clothes and keep them free of stains.  However, when they do get dirty there's nothing I enjoy more than getting them clean again.  While I'm not terribly picky about the detergent I use (any bargain detergent will do for me) I enjoy using all different types so my clothes always have a different smell.  Enter my recent detergent choice, Tide Ultra with Febreze Freshness Spring and Renewal Scent Powder.  Here are my thoughts;                                                                     Pros                                                                     + Concentrated formula yields plenty of loads.                                                                     + Decent stain removal.                                                                     + Fresh scent with Febreze.                                                                     Cons                                                                     - Can still leave behind the powdery white residue on darker colored fabrics.                                                                     - Fragrance may be too aromatic for some people.  It does make my dog sneeze!                                                                     - Not really made for High Efficiency washers.                                                                     In the end, Tide Ultra with Febreze Freshness Spring and Renewal Scent Powder does exactly what it's supposed to do.  It removes dirt, stains and odor well enough while leaving your clothes smelling fresh and clean.  Personally the price tag is a bit high for what I prefer to spend on detergent, but for some, price is no object when it comes to keeping their clothes spotless and odor free.  With that, I couldn't agree more."
5.00,"okay...so I won't say using Ultra Tide Plus Febreeze makes doing laundry fun...or easy...BUT it sure does make it smell better...like when my mom used to do the laundry then hang it on the line to dry...remember that fresh smell?  Because the box is smaller, it sure does make it a LOT easier to carry...certainly more so than those giant plastic tubs from the warehouse store. And because the smaller box still contains enough to do 63 loads, it sure is more economical.  This box will last me almost 8 months! I don't have to buy laundry detergent until December!!"
4.00,"Its so nice to take clothes out of the drawer and have that fresh smell that seems to last all day."
5.00,"loooove tide with febreze"
5.00,"I have always used tide and now will search all over for Tide Sport!!! I run and my husband plays softball, Tide Sport is all we use."
5.00,"Since we have been using Tide my husband actually told me the clothes are getting cleaner, so no more CHEAP detergents for me,The freshness and smell are vedry pleasurable.Thaks again TIDE"
3.00,"Works neither better nor worse than other competitors. Mainly bought it for a test runs of washings. It is okay for the purpose it is intended."
5.00,"I am allergic to all brands of laundry detergent.... EXCEPT Tide. I'm so glad they have this scent. I don't have to use softner or anything because my clothes come out smelling awesome everytime. I found the larger size (52 loads) once and I can't remember where, so now I'm stuck getting the 26 loads bottle. I wish I remembered where!!!!!"
5.00,"My honey works in the garage a lot, and his clothes always end up smelling like oil/grease/gas. I was able to get them clean with other Tide products, but that \"car\" smell always lingered...but, no more! Smells fresh and clean! (I think the people saying it smells like cat urine and/or mildew need to clean their HE washers and remember to leave the door open after using!) Could you please change the color of the cap, though? I can't see the correct measurement very well in a black cap! :)"
5.00,"What an awesome product! I LOVE IT!! My clothes smell like they just were washed everyday!! My clothes feel clean with out feeling greasy like a softener can make them feel. Thanks Tide for making the best detergent out there!"
5.00,"This is the first I've used the febreze kind. I prefer the tide with color safe bleach personally. This was good since the store didn't have anything else. I will say that the smell lasts and lasts. I used this on a couple blankets and they still smell just as fresh and strong as the day I washed them which was a couple weeks ago now. Pretty nice!"
4.00,"I like the idea of febreeze in Tide, but not this scent... Smells too perfumey compared to the original or to April Fresh."
5.00,"I heard from my parents about this product but always brought the cheaper detergents well I finally decided to squeeze it in the budget and I must say I will never use any other product again , My clothes smell very fresh and clean and all the stains are gone , This is the best product ever !! I love it and will always buy for now on ,Thank you Tide"
5.00,"I have an invalid at home who soaks his bedding. The most expensive detergents fell far short as far as removing odors goes. Now, I spend a little and get laundry that is clean and smells pretty good compared with Tide with Febreze. Hope they don't try to \"improve\" Sun. It's great just the way it is."
3.00,"These little packs were inexpensive so I thought I would give them a shot. I ended up using them and they really don't boost scent or detergent power. After reading the packaging label, it appears like this is nothing more than OxyClean placed in dissolving packets with a an orange liquid placed on top. I won't be a repeat purchaser."
4.00,"I love Febreeze Sport. Now I own an HE washer. Febreeze Sport does not come in HE form.P&G : Please help!"
4.00,"I tried the detergent today, I love the scent. Not very sure about the effectiveness as I was not washing soiled clothes today."
5.00,"It does work very good"
5.00,"THIS IS THE ONLY DETERGENT I BUY, IT WORKS GREAT FOR THE HOUSE HOLD USE TOO I USE IT FOR MY FLOORS,BATHROOM, AND CLEAN THE COUNTERS. EVERYONE LOVES THE SMELL IN MY HOME. ALSO MY HUSBAND HAS BAD SINUS AND THIS DOES NOT MAKE HIM SNEEZ OR BREAKOUT. THANK YOU.. (COUPONS WOULD BE GREAT)"
5.00,"The title about says it all -- that pretty much covers everything I want a detergent to do for me. Tide has always been my favorite brand since it seems to get out the stains that other detergents do not. I use it in a front load HE machine. The Febreze scent is a big plus for me, especially for workout clothes that can get a bit on the smelly side. The scent is very fresh but not overpowering. Highly recommend."
5.00,"Excellent product but arrived leaking. Had to return it to local store for exchange. This was ordered for home delivery."
5.00,"I love this product! I have a child with a hormonal disorder and her body odor can be pretty bad, even after the clothing has come from the washer! Tide with febreze sport completely removes the odor AND leaves the item with a pleasant scent. The balance of my laundry also is clean and smells great. Nothing like fresh crisp bedsheets with a nice aroma when going to bed!"
5.00,"Where have you been all of my life? I am in love!....I bought Tide w/febreze and I love it! I can wear a top that I washed two weeks ago and still smell the fresh scent. I love it!. Never consider discontinuing this product!"
4.00,"It got my whites clean without using bleach. Nice scent, yet not too strong. Have not had it long enough for any more input."
3.00,"I loved this scent and was thrilled to find it online for a great price.  However, thanks to 2 price increases in less than a month, now I can get it cheaper at my local grocery store."
5.00,"I must say this is one of the best smelling Tides I have bought. I have no idea what the other people here are talking about saying that the smell is to pungent it smells great and is long lasting. It is a great product and a must try leaves cloth smelling great and clean as well."
5.00,"I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS PRODUCT. I WISH THERE WERE BIGGER SIZES. THE SMELL IS WONDERFUL AND I LOVE THAT THE SCENT DOESN'T LEAVE MY CLOTHES. I NEED THE HE FOR MY WASHER HOWEVER IT IS SO DIFFICULT TO FIND IT AND IT IS NEVER THE BIG ONE I CAN ONLY FIND IT IN SMALL SIZES. I DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT."
5.00,"If you are looking for a product that cleans and freshens laundry, look no further, this is the one for you."
5.00,"I've always used Tide and its easier with the big jug and not as expense as other at dosen't do what Tide does and home delievery makes thing very good"
5.00,"I have been using Gain for years and decided to buy Tide with Fabreze.... the smell is absolutely awesome and washing clothes with it is a pleasure.... I found something amazing which furthers my belief that Tide is the best, even clothes I washed in Gain smells of the Tide, just from hanging beside the Tide washed clothes in my closet.... the Tide spring & renewal is awesome...."
5.00,"I absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE Tide with Febreeze!!!! I have washed all my couch cushions in it, my childrens bedding and ALL of our clothes!!! I love the freshness of the smell!!! Thank you for a great product :)"
2.00,"I had not been a Tide consumer until I tried the 2x Ultra coldwater based on the Consumer Rpts review. I absolutely loved this detergent, it made me a Tide lover! Please bring it back to market... I have moved on to Era's 2x ultra product."
4.00,"It would help if the product finder allowed a person to search by scent. I can't stand the \"fresh scent\" but don't mind \"mountain spring\" and now we can't seem to find it anywhere in our area. Actually, if you made an unscented Coldwater, we'd be happiest."
1.00,"I had to return this, since the scent is way too strong and gave me a headache. I also don't like the fact that the opening is so large and wastes product. I don't like a petroleum-based product. I drove across town (Whole Foods), to find the Seventh Generation - Eucalyptus and Lavender detergent which we love and the scent is mild. It's also not petroleum based. Note: Target now carries the Seventh Generation products."
5.00,"I received what looked like spam saying I was being issued a credit for this purchase and asking me to click on a link. Cautiously, I didn't. Then I received an e-mail telling me the items had been damaged in shipment, were returned to Amazon and my order had been cancelled. I'm not sure if these were one-of-a-kind items ;) and so my order couldn't be re-fulfilled, but I just went to the supermarket and bought a similar product. I'm not sure why there isn't a mechanism in place to simply replace a damaged shipment of a commodity product. By the way, the product earns 5 stars but Amazon's fulfillment of my order earns zero which is, unfortunately, not an option."
1.00,"This is nowhere nere the old tide. I assum the cost cutting has removed some important stuff out of the bottle."
5.00,"Great product at a great price. I have used Tide for years and I will continue to use this product."
2.00,"It just doesn't clean well at all.  I have to use a stain remover and a laundry additive to get clothes clean.  I'm waiting to use it all up, but I wouldn't buy it again."
1.00,"I bought a huge bottle of this, seeing the CR rated it with top marks and thinking it would save me money with the cold water. Well, I had just started an executive job and bought all new clothes. They quickly began to show wear in ways I'd never seen. The edges of my pants started to fade, shirts faded, pima cotton shirts developed pin holes that spread. I'm convinced that this product cleans well in cold because it has harsher cleaners and is no value because it wears your clothes out faster. While I stand by the Tide brand, I do not recommend coldwater."
4.00,"I would recommend this product but would appreciate it if there were a dye/fragrance free version as we have several family members with skin allergies, which means separating into several loads. Please make a dye/fragrance free version!!!"
5.00,"My family has itch issues with detergent that contains fragrance.                                              I have total brand loyalty to Tide.                                              We purchased an HE washer last summer.                                              Consumer Reports sez the Coldwater works better than the regular (even in warm water).                                              Price is nice.                                              Shipping is \"free\" with Amazon Prime.                                              We can subscribe to it.                                              This is a no brainer for us."
5.00,"Thanks Tide!"
5.00,"This product smells great, gets my cloths clean and also allows me to save money by washing everything in the cold wash. I have not tried this on my sheets or whites though, because I think sheets and whites needs to be washed in warmer water to get rid of possible bacteria."
5.00,"Love your cold water product but I am waiting for an HE VERSION as I have recently purchased a front loader. Please hurry"
5.00,"I have been using tide for over 40 years and would not even try anything else. My husband has come in with clothes, that at first glance, most people would have tossed in trash. BUT tide has cleaned spotlessly almost every time. Grease, oils and most any other grime you can imagine from working on large trucks. And NASCAR used the powder type in the cleanup at the Daytona firey wreck, to clean all the chemicals dropped on the track from the jet dryer and car that caught fire. I have a septic system and have never had a build up using hot or cold water."
1.00,"My wife is allergic to most fragrances, and we have a new baby, so we love this detergent. 5 stars all the way. I give this 1 star because Amazon has made this a rip off. When it was subscribe and save eligible, I purchased 2 twin packs for almost the same price as 1 today. The seller is listed as amazon.com. Why no s&s eligibility, and why the ridiculous price?"
1.00,"I have read tons of reviews on how this stuff is the best at cleaning. I just bought a bottle of it to try. I guess I do not know how to use a washing machine. (kidding) I followed the directions to a T. My work clothes are just dirty. No grass stains. No blood. No grease. Just your basic day at work getting dirty. Not very dirty either. In fact this was one of my easier days. One would think by just washing with soap they would come clean. NOPE !!! Not at all. I looked at my shirt prior to placing it in the dryer and it is still dirty. So, to all you people out there that swear by tide and say it gets your clothes clean I say prove it! I am sure they smell better, but they are no cleaner. I can't even believe how many people think this stuff is so great. I will continue my search to find a clothes washing detergent that actually works. I do not want to have to use Shout on every little bit of dirt I get on my clothes to get them clean. This is ridiculous! So, if anyone has a recommendation on what to use or how to use please let me know. I will not waste almost $10 on a bottle of Tide again. Thanks, Tim"
5.00,"My wife picked this up, with her smart Idea to save money. It works. Think, no hot water wasted from the hot water heater, or energy wasted from the washer heating up the water, its great. Our old home with small water heater barely lets us both take a shower, so this helps us conserve hot water. Sheets, cloths, all turn out the same. And its not like i give it a chance... I work on cars all the time, rewireing the atic, she does stuff in the yard, and the kids... well, they do enough. This stuff WORKS.. Actilift or not! The title says one thing, the bottle pic shows something else, and I dont care... IT WORKS."
4.00,"I have an 18 year old pampered cat...who is earning her nickname of \"stinky.\" I cover all her favorite places to sleep with throw blankets and I'm constantly washing them. This Tide liquid with Spring and Renewal Fabreze Freshness is perfect for cleaning her blankets and taking care of the aroma problems. Any laundry that consists of \"tough stuff\" gets washed in this Tide liquid. Beach blankets, car washing towels, gardening gloves, etc. get the Tide treatment. They come out clean and \"springy fresh.\" Since I garden every day I have clothes that get mighty dirty while spreading the horse manure, and a more delicate detergent just doesn't quite do the job. Tide for the tough stuff! This 92 oz. container does 48 loads, and that's a lot of kitty blankies."
4.00,"Does a great job. I use less soap, which seems to offset the higher price. Only problem had is that some of the soap spilled out during shipment."
5.00,"Tide is excellent as always and you really can't beat this price!"
5.00,"Now to find out where to get more of this great product. Local stores do not handle poeders any more. Cold water is the way to go for me."
1.00,"Will be hearing from the state attorney. No where could I find the deal that was advertised on 1 sale"
4.00,"I like to using Tide coldwater liquid for laundry. It's good for my clothes =)"
1.00,"My whole point of a coldwater detergent is to wash knit tops so they don't fade or shrink. I placed the detergent in the washing machine before adding my clothes. One of my light grey shirts touched the detergent, and now the areas of contact are pink! The shirt is ruined. No more Tide for me."
5.00,"My husband works in construction and his clothes really stink at the end of the day. I've tried various detergents but this is the first one that actually gets them smelling fresh and clean."
5.00,"Our clothes come out clean and smelling great consistently! We are also very excited about the energy savings of not having to use the hot water."
3.00,"goood product. also when you buy here you get it at good price Lasts for larger number of loads waiting for save and subscribe deal on this .."
5.00,"I have not tried this product yet, but from the sounds of it I will be making a wise decision. Love Tide and now helps me save money and go green!!"
5.00,"This detergent is simply the best..a great fresh scent and even suds up in the hardest of water."
1.00,"There was a reason my mother used hot water for bed linen... I had to learn why the painful way, after I developed an allergy to dust mites. And had to buy a mattress protection, and hypoallergenic pillow cases, and re-wash everything anyway. So much for the savings! Besides, I'm now stuck with 4 huge bottles of detergent I don't like, that has a nasty smell, has NO actilift, and does a lousy jod on laundry. Definitely not recommended."
4.00,"I have a lot of cloths that I use for athletics so smelly and stainy cloths that are delicate are a common occurance. Tide did a fairly good job of cleaning and the hint of downy was a nice addition but it was not that strong. It was not that strong to the point that if I did not have the cloths in my face I could not smell it and I noticed no difference in \"softness\". All in all, not bad but I would not pay full price for this I would look at something like Wisk for those hard to beat stains and smells."
5.00,"I am an avid Tide only user, and all Tides work in cold water but this is the best! I use a small amount of pretreat on my kids' stuff that they destroyed and almost always get the stains, which is really saying something! Love it, love it love it!!!!!!!!!"
4.00,"I love this Tide for cold water. I'm impressed with the nice fresh smell and the way it cleans especially in cold water. My daughter and I both really like this Tide, she is the one that commented on the fresh smell first. My grandson was playing on my granddaughters blanket that had been washed at least 3 days before and she said \"hey, this blanket smells as good today as it did they day I washed it.\""
5.00,"I received the product very fast. Tide has always done a fantastic job at cleaning my cloths and getting out stains."
5.00,"I really love this product. I tend to get stains on my clothes and I get messy easily, so it's great to have a laundry detergent that not only gets my clothes clean, but also saves me some money on m energy bills. Keep up the good work, Tide!"
5.00,"May be a laundry enthusiast could comment more, but for a normal guy wanting to get his clothes clean this one definitely works for me! Cleans my clothes and leaves a pleasant smell, works great for"
5.00,"This is the BEST detergent if you don't want extra chemicals and scents that pollute. It is difficult to find in stores, as they push the worst, chemical laden scented varieties instead of a simple, good, clean wash without extra pollutants. Thank you Amazon for carrying it!"
5.00,"We've been using this product for a couple of years now.  We have a front-loader LG washer that requires HE detergent, we prefer the cold-water wash to save energy, and my wife insists on the fragrance-free variety.  We were buying it as needed in our local supermarket, and then were chagrined to find out they had stopped carrying it. We could get Tide HE Coldwater, or Tide HE Free, but not the full combination.  We looked in other stores around town and couldn't find it, and were afraid Procter &amp; Gamble had stopped producing it.  So when we found it available on Amazon, we ordered a 4-pack, which should last us for a while.  I hope it's still available the next time we need it.                                                                     The detergent itself works beautifully.  And of course Amazon shipped it to us for free, and it got here promptly, but you knew that."
4.00,"This is Coldwater HE Fresh Scent Tide , no Actilift, so the description is wrong here. I still like it because where else can you get a 100oz bottle of Tide for under $10?!"
5.00,"Tide is the one and only laundry detergent for our household. I remember when you could get a box (all that was available) for .49 cents. Still does the job it always has, Cleans our clothes! Smells so good and no one breaks out, that happened 39 years ago when I had babies and LOTS of diapers!!! thought I could save $ on a less expensive brand, oh boy, major mistake. It's Tide for Me, Loyal"
5.00,"It would be even better if it was available UNSCENTED. Many people have allergies to the scented offerings and would appreciate having an unscented Tide cold water option. Thanks."
5.00,"I've been using Tide Coldwater for a couple of years, but the new liquid takes stain removal up a notch. I have great luck washing even white socks in cold water. Now, when do we get an HE version? I have both a top-loading and front-loading washer, and would love to use Tide Coldwater liquid in my front-loader."
5.00,"Consumer Reports regularly says Tide does a very good job of cleaning, even if it's not the cheapest stuff out there. You have to track the price, and subscribe and save is the way to go. With the 20% discount the price usually beats what I'd pay at the grocery store, often if only by a little bit. Again, you have to track the price and make sure you're getting a good deal. I've been pleased with the cleaning job it does. The clothes come out clean and smelling fresh. It's top quality detergent."
5.00,"I started buying the coldwater fresh scent when they started selling it. I have 2 daughters both teens at the time and they loved the smell of their clothes. They noticed right away. I've always used Tide, it was what I was raised on but I do love the way it smells. Works great."
4.00,"This product is not available in High efficiency formula in my area even now months after I placed my order. The product works well but it is hard to be satified with a detergent that took three months to get and cost $12.00 per bottle; no matter how well it works."
3.00,"I just found out about Tide Coldwater, which sounds great. I do all my laundry in an HE front-loader on either the 60°F or 95°F setting, and would be happy to have a detergent designed for that. But I can't stand the scents used in most detergents -- I always get unscented... and Tide Coldwater isn't available in unscented HE. Oh well."
5.00,"My son likes this product, he said he wasn't able to find it in the stores around here so glad he could get it on line."
5.00,"No scent for his clothes. Works well getting the stains out and with S&S its cheaper than the stores and I don't have to leave the house."
5.00,"This is my favorite! I don't like pods, I don't like powder. I like knowing it's already dissolved and good to go. I hope this product will continue being able to be shipped to Guam!"
5.00,"What can I say? How can you go wrong with Tide? Although, I just received notification that this product is being discontinued... So, I'll have to see what other flavors are available at less than what I can purchase them through our local stores. Otherwise, what's the point of ordering through the internet?"
5.00,"cold water tide is the best. saves me $ by washing in cold water. still gets my families clothes nice and clean. when it first came out, i found it all the time in the stores. now i hardly ever see it..my lost......................."
4.00,"I have no complaints about the cleaning abilities of the detergent. What I would like to see on the packaging is guidance for how much detergent to use in a smaller washer. MIne is a 24 inch front-loader and I don't know whether the instructions on the package apply or not. I find it very difficult to measure the detergent accurately, since the top is the same color as the detergent and the measurement lines are very difficult to see."
5.00,"Tide Coldwater HE Fresh Scent Detergent,50 Ounce (Pack Of 2)This item is great for my family and the convenience of the 2 pack is wonderful."
4.00,"Well I'm not sure what to say about this product it is Unscented Detergent for High Efficiency Machines . ."
1.00,"I love the \"fresh\" scent, but wow the Mountain Spring S-T-I-N-K-S! Unless you love a detergent that smells like some guy dumped a bottle of his cologne in it, don't buy the Mountain Spring!"
3.00,"I have been using tide for over 30 years. Throughout the years there have been many changes. Even though it cost more, I stuck with my tide. When I tried the 2x coldwater tide, and had to use just a 1/4 cup, I was thrilled. What happened? I find I am using more than a cup with this actilift. Bring back the 2x tide!!! Even the fragrance is different. Don't ruin a good thing."
5.00,"I tool love the Tide coldwater, but I can't find it!! Especially in the powder which I prefer. The few times I have found it, it works awesome. I have 3 boys so that says alot."
4.00,"I tried it. But, the fabric softener isn't that great a deal, and we had to use drier sheets anyhow. So, I'll buy without the added softener from here forward."
5.00,"I started using Tide for cold water when my daughter told me how much she loved it. I buy it all the time now. The frangrance is light and amazing, I fing myself smelling my clothes as I wear them! And my clothes come out clean! The only thing i want from Tide is a coupon for it!"
4.00,"bought this when it was on sale and what more can you say..kept the laundry clean and fresh..the only downside is the scent is not as great and soothing as some of the other detergents out there"
5.00,"For detergent, it is often times cheaper to purchase it locally. In this case, I was able to use Tide as an add-on to get me to the minimum amount for free shipping on my order. Great product, great price."
5.00,"It cleans my clothes great. The best thing I like about this product is that it cleans my whites like the regular tide did. The one thing I don't like about the product is that it hard to find in San Diego, so whenever I see it I buy it."
4.00,"THis is the same thing as the store, so no big surprises. Just more convenient than running to the store."
4.00,"Tide HE washing power #1 it really do fight stains will recommend also like scent it leaves on cothes great"
5.00,"We Love tide,have tried other products has never happy, i always use tide,clorox bleach & downy. If u use cold water,will it still disnefect your whites ?"
5.00,"What can you say about Tide but that it works and does what it's suppose to do. I got very good deal on Amazon, as usual, and try to stock up when I see a deal on it."
5.00,"Well - what should I say? I used Tide Febreze Sport during my honeymoon on a roadtrip through California. I loved the smell of the detergent and of course of the clothes after washing them. While there may be some detergents with similar cleaning power - there is no detergent with that beautiful scent. So what to do if the brand is not available in germany? Right. Buy it on amazon.com. For a small fortune inluding shipping cost and customs and so on. But its worth it!"
5.00,"and happy and my clothes are clean But I don't use the recommended amount, i use maybe an 8th a of cap full. DO NOT USE 8 CAPS full, bad things happen."
5.00,"give this product 5 stars. I love that it is for cold water. seem to get the clothes quite as clean as regular tide... But still does a good job and would recommend this product to anyone."
5.00,"Love tide. Fresh, clean stain free clothing with every wash. Wouldn't use anything else. Prompt delivery. Great price. Makes doing laundry less of a chore."
5.00,"I have to have free n clear for my daughters eczema, so I buy whatever is on sale and add a booster like oxyclean to it normally.Tried this due to a coupon, and I love it, clothes cleaner.No booster necessary.Never had Tide before because it was always way more $$ than other things.now I know why.This is truly a superior soap.I use it in a traditional top load washer and it works better than anything on the market."
5.00,"I love Tide products and this was no exception. The new top has extra reinforcements which I think is a good idea. As for the soap itself, I love it. Adding the Downy to it makes for a good partnership in laundry and soft clothes. Others complained about this soap making their clothes smell weird, but I didn't notice any odor. In fact, my experience has been gentle and pleasant. I love Tide!"
4.00,"Dark blue detergent with dark blue measuring cap is not the best of choice. The dark blue on dark blue is awkward to measure even in good lighting. Packaging should be contrasting colors of detergent product and measuring cap. For the dark blue detergent, I suggest white cap for the product works better."
5.00,"Great product. Really washes my clothes as perfect as it says on the advertisement. Yet, one problem nags me is you cannot possibly control how much you use every time."
5.00,"Having 5 in our family, laundry can pile up quick, most of it is stained or dirty, especially with my husband working in a factory job. Tide Cold-water does an awesome job of getting the stains out. I think it smells wonderful, sure it's strong, but if you go by the measuring on the side of the cup, it shouldn't be. I love Amazon's super fast shipping! Got 2 days after I ordered! Thanks Amazon for helping us save money & providing great products!"
3.00,"After I ordered this, a regular chain grocery had it for $5.99 for 50oz. With shipping and using an Amazon coupon, I paid $15.07 for 2) 50 oz containers. Just goes to show not everything is cheaper on Amazon. Now let's see if moderators will actually let this review through."
1.00,"After a few washes I realized this stuff isn't as good as the regular tide free for HE.  My babies clothes came out feeling rough and not as soft... it also didn't get out the yellow newborn poop color like the regular stuff did.  I'll be sticking to the non cold water version.                                                                     And in addition - we did have 1/4 bottles come open during shipping!  It was a mess!  I won't be ordering detergent online anymore!"
5.00,"I can get cleaner clothes in cold water with Cold Water Tide than I can using warm water with other brands plus I use less liquid. I save three ways,,on hot water,my clothes are super clean with all stains gone,plus save money. If you like your family looking their best with no greasy stains or faded shirts ,GO TIDE GO CLEAN!!!!"
3.00,"Tide Cold Water HE Fresh Scent with Actilift, 100-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 4) when I received it , it just Tide Cold Water HE Fresh Scent \"no Actilift\" in the product so sad with this purchase"
5.00,"Signing up for subscription buying is such a great way to buy essentials, like Tide. We never run out and know we'll always have the best brand names at the best prices on our shelves."
5.00,"I have been using tide for years. This was a great price. AMAZON is the best."
4.00,"I Don't see the difference with the color caps except that it is easy to find the scent I like by the cap color. Save the cap from the larger one if you like it so much. I prefer the cap colored."
5.00,"It works and I got it for the price and the fact it is free and gentle. If that is really true."
5.00,"I always use cold water Tide - when I can find it. It is the only detergent that I like. Both scents are awesome. Love it - wish it were everywhere!"
5.00,"I hate to sound cliche and say exactly what they do in commercials but its true, nothing leaves your clothes cleaner, fresher, and in better condition. I was using generic laundry detergent and like they say in the commercials I was going through twice as much detergent and still not coming as clean. My husband operates heavy equipment on sewer line for a living so you can imagine how gross he brings his clothes home, and Tide is the only thing we've found that gets his clothes fully cleaned, and gets all odors out!"
5.00,"Have always liked Tide and this product is good at getting out stains in cold water. I don't use other pretreating products. I have found that if I put some Tide on the spot about 10 - 20 minutes before starting the wash, it works just as well."
4.00,"I've been very happy with Tide and the Free and Gentle doesn't leave the scent or harsh chemicals behind. I just wish I could get the extra large bottles instead of these mini bottles because I hate wasting the plastic containers. Refill packs would be great."
4.00,"I have never bought powdered laundry detergent before this. I was reading stories online that it doesn't clean your laundry as good as liquid detergent, however I was impressed by how sudsy this made my load. Since it is also formulated for cold water washes, it is perfect for me because I don't like exposing my clothes to high temperatures. Tide has always kept my clothes colorful. I gave it four stars because the scooper was buried in the box and I got detergent all over my hands and made them a little itchy. Be careful with skin contact."
5.00,"I tried Arm &amp; Hammer HE because it was cheaper...big mistake! I ended up paying more because I had to buy separate spot/stain agents in order to have semi-clean laundry. I did some research on what ordinary people thought was the best detergent out there.  Overwhelmingly, everyone seemed to prefer Tide and specifically the COLD WATER type.  I tried it and I loved it!  It got out all the stains. Even baby formula vomit (sorry).  Not only that, my laundry actually SMELLS clean.  That's it. I'm convinced. TIDE is the way to go. With a daily, sweaty, exercising hubby, a newborn and a toddler, this is the detergent for me. One less thing I have to worry about &amp; worth every penny! I know I sound a bit like a commercial, but this stuff really works!"
5.00,"I do all my washing in cold water to help the planet and save energy. I used tide in cold water before they came out with cold water tide it worked great, but cold water tide is even better. I would not use any thing else, my husband brings home other brands that are on sale and I use those to wash the cleaning rags and dog and cat blankets. nothing works better than tide. NOTHING!!!!"
2.00,"Although this product clearly states that it is the Tide Coldwater with Actilift, I was sent plain Tide Coldwater. Very disappointing and annoying that I will now have to spend the time returning the product."
5.00,"This detergent washes clothes very well. Also, leaves clothes smelling so good. Will make this my only detergent. It's great."
5.00,"Gets things white"
5.00,"No other laundry detergent can compete with Tide and with Amazon Subscribe and Save you get a great deal! I highly recommend Tide!"
5.00,"I really love the Mountain Spring scent of Tide. It is less harsh than the Fresh Scent, which I really dislike. But I wish the local stores around where I live carried the Mountain Spring in the very big jug. The one with a pour spout. They do not carry it here, and I do not even know if Tide makes Mountain Spring in that size. All I can ever find in the large size is the Fresh Scent, So I always have to buy the small jugs of Mountain Spring. Otherwise this product is amazing, and I will not use anything else ever!"
5.00,"Tide has been my choice of washing soap for years and I find that the product is continually being upgraded to my advantage. I use the cold water product and this allows me to help conserve on my water and electricity bill. I am pleased with the scent that is left in my clothes and they always look great."
5.00,"I decided to give Tide Coldwater a try since I'm a college student trying to save money on everything I possibly can. I wanted to save on my energy bills, so I switched to Tide Coldwater detergent. It gets stains out so well in COLD water! Who would've thought?! I kill two birds with one stone using this product---getting my clothes clean/stains removed + saving $$$ on energy bills! The only thing I can think of is that there should be more locations that carry Tide Coldwater...I had to look at so many stores to find Tide Coldwater. Thanks Tide Coldwater!"
2.00,"it just does the job. its nothing special I would only buy it if its on sale.to each their own"
5.00,"We always buy this. Works well in the HE washing machine. I only wish I could find the bigger version that was prime eligible."
1.00,"im srending this regarding your product i purshed recently the liquid detergent was very watery and did not bring my clothes clean i love your product and will continue using but thought you should know thank you from a concerned customer"
5.00,"Delighted with this purchase and others now subcribed to through the \"Subscribe and Save\" plan. Excellent Program! Can some of my repeat purchases be combined for shipment? Seems to me a savings for Amazon. Ed McAvoy"
3.00,"I like the Tide brand so I think this is a nice deal. I would like the bigger bottles to buy next time."
5.00,"I have tried them all,but I will always come back to TIDE.I am a beliver now"
4.00,"I had never used Tide Free, but the price was too good to pass up, and knew that any Tide product I have used has been tops."
4.00,"this was very nice, but is no longer available, as its been discontinued. i guess ill have to find a new kind sadly"
4.00,"We have a well and discovered that Cold Water Tide works the best for us. We don't use warm or hot water to wash our clothes and well water is much colder so that other detergents just can't compete."
2.00,"I am not sure what a Mountain Spring should smell like but I did not expect this! It smells like cheap men's cologne and the scent is very strong. YUCK! I accepted this as a substitute for Fresh Scent since the order I ploaced of that was damaged during shipping and they did not have any more to send me."
3.00,"They arrived with no packing and one had leaked all over. We won't do the bulk laundry soap buy again but generally the subscribe and save deals are great!"
1.00,"I always wash with cold water so i assumed buying tide coldwater was the way to go. Big Mistake!!! Did not even touch any kind of stain. the macaroni stain on my daughters shirt remained in the same spot, none of my clothes looked remotely clean, and acti lift is a joke! I do not recommend this product to anyone"
5.00,"Cleans really well in my front load washer; gets stains from gardening out in cold water. I am very happy with this product. Amazon packaged well and delivered quickly."
5.00,"I have 3 small childern and I have tried other laundry soaps and I keep coming back to Tide Coldwater HE,it works GREAT and ALWAYS gets my stains out without having to pre-wash or pre-treat my kids clothes.They smell great and look brand new every wash.Love Tide laundry soap."
1.00,"The odor is strong and lingers. I had to rewash all items because it bothered me to the point I could not sleep in those sheets. THE WHOLE BOTTLE WAS A COMPLETE LOST."
5.00,"It's tide, what else is there to say. They are far and away the top detergent out there and this coldwater formual is no different. A lil pricy but as the saying goes you get what you pay for"
5.00,"I just purchased a top load washer HE and wanted to try the Tide Colwater HE detergent. I always read up on products before purchasing to see how other users have rated the product. I read good and not so good so I decided to try it myself. I LOVE this detergent! It suds up and actually I personally think works better in cold water than the regular HE tide. I must add also that I have previously owned two front load HE washers and did not care for them. Thanks Tide for making a Coldwater detergent!"
5.00,"Works as well as regular Tide, so that's awesome. But what's even better is the deal! Comparing this to my local grocery store, it's about half off. It's a great deal, for a great product."
5.00,"When I got this product it had leaked out (which was probably UPS fault) but amazon made it right and sent me a new product. Love dealing with them! Wish everything was that easy"
4.00,"Great Price with Subscribe and Save. I love the fact that it is unscented and available with SS. I am not a firm believer in name brands but this does seem to do a great job cleaning my laundry."
2.00,"Not sure where they come up with the regular price - perhaps its to make you feel like you just got a discount. As a comparison The local grocery store has the 100oz for $12 and Target will sell the 150oz for $18. So for 50oz this is a ripoff. T"
5.00,"For some reason P&G had always made TIDE their best laundry detergent. Love the scent and have tried various Fabreze Tide Laundry detergent. Love it is is just the best. Throughout the years Consumers Reports has always thought highly if the TIDE line of detergents. Just wonderful I have a front loader and use TIDE HE of various types Just love it Highly recommend it!!!!"
5.00,"With this Tide Free and Gentle I don't have to worry about my families sensitive skin....no problems at all. Besides, I trust Tide to get my clothes clean."
5.00,"I've tried them all...but when I found this on Amazon for such an Amazing price, I had to buy (used the coupon too)...I could tell it was different from the other brands just by the consistency of the liquid - is brighter, thicker and visually richer. Didn't seem watered down like many other brands I have tried. The clothes came out brighter and smelled fantastic. I'm now hooked on Tide."
2.00,"thanks for staining blue spots on clothes for my science fair project :)"
1.00,"I love the product, but as I read on several other reviews from people that didn't receive the shipment due to damaged product. I hope I get a refund! If they are going to have trouble shipping liquid items, just don't bother to offer it. Go to the store and buy the product, God only knows how they damaged the product in shipment, it seems like they would have to be pretty rough to damage four bottles of tide packed in a box. lol"
5.00,"Always washing clothes with cold water is one tip to making them last longer. With this ColdWater Tide, there's no question that the clothes are as clean or cleaner, without ever using warm water. This pack is priced as cheaply as my bulk-size membership store Tide. And it shows up right at my front door. No complaints at all!"
5.00,"Tide is just better, more expensive BUT better, Thank you for the cold water version cause I can't get the hot water hose hooked up."
5.00,"I USED COLDWATER TIDE AND THEN I COMPARED MY WHITES NEXT TO THE WHITES I WASHED WITH ANOTHER PRODUCT. THERE WAS NO COMPARISON, COLDWATER TIDE WAS MUCH WHITER. RECOMEND TO ALL MY FRIENDS"
5.00,"Tide has always been the best and this product even excells more, brighter whites, stronger colors, a really great detergent."
3.00,"I was happy but then I received an email that this offer was no longer offered so I only received it one time when I expected to receive it periodically. Too bad!"
1.00,"I have never used anything other than Tide. I love the coldwater and have been using it for sometime. I sent my boyfriend to the store this time and not realizing there was a difference, he bought the \"Mountain Spring\" scent. It is by far the worst smelling detergent I have ever smelled! I did not realize it until I pulled my comforter out of the dryer. It smells like old cheap cologne! The smell it overbearing and takes your breathe away. It still lingers in the dryer. I am hoping the store will exchange it for the \"fresh scent\", if not I will be stuck with a full bottle that I will never use. I would definitely recommend the coldwater tide but only the \"fresh scent\" do your self a favor and DO NOT buy the “Mountain Spring” scent!!"
5.00,"For years we have used Tide Original, which says it can be used in all temperatures, including cold water. While this product does work well in cold water, I don't see any difference from using Tide Original. However, I pay 19.99 for 170 oz of Tide Original at my local Costco. This product costs considerably more, and is not worth the extra expense because the results are the same."
5.00,"I have used Cheer and Era for years and really like them both. I bought 1 bottle of Tide Coldwater to try and several of the other brands I use as I do over 100 loads of laundry a month. I LOVED the Tide. It works great, I don't have to use as much to have clean cloths and my family and I LOVE the smell! When you pull a bath towel out of the linen closet it smells so refreshing you can't help but sniff the towels each time you get one out! But It's not a strong or overwhelming smell, even for the asthmatics in the house. After years of being faithful to Cheer and Era, I've made the change and don't regret it."
3.00,"I purchased a 4 pack of Tide detergent with Actilift. It had to be returned and the replacement box of Tide was an older version and did not have the Actilift technology in the product. Very unhappy with Amazon no replacing like for like."
4.00,"I like the idea of washing in cold water but they don't have an alternative for HE washing machines. I have used Tide Coldwater in my washer, but I understand that it could get ruined by using regular detergent. I wish Tide would make an HE cold water alternative. In FAQ they say to use the HE detergents, but they don't explain why not to use it in HE machines and what the cold water alternative is."
4.00,"I give this product 4 stars. I love that it is for cold water. But doest seem to get the clothes quite as clean as regular tide... But still does a good job and would recommend this product to anyone."
2.00,"Really not happy with Tide Coldwater. Love the smell but it did no better than regular detergent in cold water. My 3 year old had ketchup on his shirt and even after soaking the whole load for 30 minutes it was still there. I think I'll stick with a less expensive detergent and just pretreat the ocassional spot."
5.00,"I was very happy to get this excellent buy on the detergent. Already a fan of Tide, I'm always up for a deal and adding it to my Amazon Prime free shipping. I couldn't go wrong."
3.00,"I never realized that this size bottle (the size I most commonly purchase) was advertised as being good for 26 loads. I think it's more like 20 loads with typical use. But I've been using the Tide Coldwater for nearly a decade, I think. It doesn't agitate my sensitive skin, it gets my clothes clean. That's pretty much all I need it to do."
5.00,"This is the number one laundry detergent by far. It does an outstanding job of removing stains and foul odors. The Febreze ingredient has a nice odor which is mild, pleasant and fresh. Yes, it is a bit pricey but is well worth the cost. If you are looking for a laundry detergent that cleans your clothes better than any other detergent then get yourself some of this Tide."
5.00,"Glad to not have to lug these home from the grocery store. Delivered right to my door. Can't say whether I saved money or not as I am not a shopper who looks at prices very detailed. But am trying to save on grocery bill, so buying in bulk from Amazon when I can. I'm very pleased with this product."
4.00,"I was so glad to find powder Tide for cold water is sold on Amazon. The only cold water detergent available in stores is the liquid kind, and in large, heavy jugs. People with arthritis in the hands have difficulty handling a multi-pound jug of detergent! A scoop of powder is so much easier to handle and less likely to spill. So we like this product. It arrived promptly."
5.00,"Tide is a great detergent, but why buy a bunch of water and an unenvironmental frendily plastic bottle. Buy the powder! It works tons better and the box is recyclable fiberboard!"
5.00,"I have been a Tide user for 30 some years, would never use anything else. All of the Tides work well in cold water. I haven't used anything but cold water to wash for years. Best product on the market today. I switch scents every so often for variety, they all smell great. Keep up the good work!!!!!"
4.00,"This laundry detergent does a great job cleaning my clothes. Nothing out of the ordinary here. Does exactly as it claims - cleans my clothes."
4.00,"I USE TO BE VERY ALLERGIC TO TIDE. AS A CHILD, I WOULD BREAK OUT BAD. BUT, NOW, IT IS WORKING SO FAR. I AM BEGINNING TO LIKE IT. THANK YOU."
1.00,"I have used the cold water tide several times now and all my clothes have a musty odor when theycome out of the dryer and especially when I iron a shirt or blouse. It seems to make the smell stronger. I do not like the product at all. I have used Tide for years, both the liquid and the granules. I am so disappointed and would like to return the bottle to the store I bought it from for a full refund."
4.00,"Washes my clothes clean and neat. I have using it for a quite a bit of time and never had any issues with this. I tried others brands too and in fact did not find much difference between them and Tide. But Tide is good and I used this for years with no issues."
5.00,"I love clothes that smell great, but I have hard water where I live so I need to use fabric softener. I use this for my washing and a lightly scented fabric softener for everything."
5.00,"I have tried other laundry products always come back to Tide Coldwater. I refuse to use warm or hot water for my laundry and Tide Coldwater is the only product I have been able to find that will clean well with cold water washing."
4.00,"Good product on colors, but my whites might need hot water to get really clean without some sort of bleach additive. I'm debating using it or not in the future. UPDATE 10-5-2009: My order on June 28, 2008 has lasted me since then. I'm completely sold on this product - it performs as advertised and I'm ordering another 3-pack. And the price has not gone up - imagine that !! Thanks Tide or Amazon or whomever is responsible for that !!!"
5.00,"This was a great price and a great product. With subscribe and save and the amazon coupon this was the lowest price I found. It was also great to have it delivered to my door. I would definitely purchase this again.(but it sure looks like it will last me a while!)"
4.00,"Tide is one of those laundry detergents where you either love the scent or hate it. I've been on the dislike side over the years because all the scents Tide has used are generally on the overwhelmingly chemical side, and after washing and drying it was obvious what product was used to clean the clothes. By adding the Febreze scent rather than their own mixture, Tide has been able to tone down the weird after-smell of their detergent. The scent of this is rather strong when poured from the bottle, but fades rather nicely by the time clothes are done in the dryer. Nothing overwhelming, just a faint scent of 'clean'. Caveat: If you have sensitive skin, you might want to skip this laundry detergent. While the rest of the family can use this, I couldn't as the clothes I wore that were washed in this caused several areas of allergic dermatitis. Not sure it it's from the sudsing agents or the added fragrance(s), but this one is a no-go for my clothes (even after an extra rinse cycle to ensure all the soap is gone)."
2.00,"they were the small bottles but tide is tide so it was a good deal for the price i got"
5.00,"What can I say? This is very good laundry detergent. It does a great job of cleaning, and smells so good."
5.00,"cleans good i can see even the stubben stains going away at least it is not fading the colours so its working for me"
5.00,"I have been a lifetime user of Tide but I was also looking for something to help conserve with our electric bill for the hot water. When I saw this in the store I was so excited about Tide coming out with detergent for cold water. Did it live up to it's reputation? YES, it sis. I am very pleased and will continue using Coldwater Tide.. My hats of to you."
5.00,"I love the Tide Coldwater!! What a difference in the rinse...the clothes don't have the soapy residue, or look dingy! My only problem is that I am having trouble finding the Fresh Scent. Mountain Spring abounds, but I prefer less scent remaining on my clothes. Thank you!"
4.00,"I love Tide Coldwater but sometimes the scents affect my allergies. It would be WONDERFUL if Tide Coldwater came in unscented like the regular Tide."
1.00,"I was so excited to use this because I've had bad luck with getting cold water to actually clean, but this detergent do any better than regular detergent. I'm not talking about stains either, just normal wear smells--like underarms, etc. :("
5.00,"Well as any hunter knows you really don't want to get flowery smells on your camo, so I decided to give this a shot- worked great at getting the mud out and left the clothes smelling like they came from the store so you can simply jazz it up with the scent of your choice when in the truck heading to your spot."
3.00,"Maybe I am reading the description wrong but I do believe this product indicates \"Tide ColdWater HE Fresh Scent with (ACTILIFT)\". Well HELLO people! I received my order (Pack of 4) minus (ACTILIFT) Absolutely no where on the bottle especially not on the cap does it state (ACTILIFT). So what is Proctor & Gamble/Amazon.com plan to do to remedy this problem and provide me with the product they are actually advertising as well as the product I thought I purchased?"
1.00,"This product simply doesn't work. Use regular Tide even in cold water! Regular Tide has always worked in cold water unlike Cold Water Tide. Go figure."
5.00,"I have used this product for two years. Besides being environmentally friendly, it is great with stain removal, in cold water. I do laundry for a 4 year old,a 20 year old and my 80 year old mother. I can safely use this for everyone."
5.00,"I don't generally spend much time sniffing my clothes once they've been washed and removed from the dryer, but sometimes I've noticed that the detergent I've used is lacking. I've noticed a musty scent on clothes after using some detergents, but usually there's no detectable scent at all. I was pleasantly surprised, though, after washing a load of clothes with Tide Plus Febreze Freshness Liquid Laundry Detergent. If asked to assess it, I might sound like I'm quoting a TV commercial. \"It smells springtime fresh,\" I'd say, and, indeed, it does. My clothes were clean, and my nostrils confirmed that they were. Even after wearing the clothes, I could still detect that distinctive Febreze scent. Why wash with anything else but Tide? P.S. For the record, I received (compliments of the Vine program) one 92 ounce jug."
4.00,"Very affordable with the use of coupon. Bought one for me and one for my daughter. Thank you Thank you"
5.00,"EXCELLENT 4STARS I HAVE A HUGE FAMILY AND WE LIVE ON A DAIRY FARM,,, FROM STAINS TO GREASE COLD WATER TIDE GETS IT ALL OUT AND LEAVES ARE CLOTHES SMELLING CLEAN AND CRISP.. WILL NEVER USE ANOTHER PRODUCT,, GOOD JOB TIDE TEAM~~~~~ CUSTOMER FOR LIFE....."
5.00,"Tide 2x Ultra Tide Coldwater Liquid Fresh Scent 52 load, 100.0-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 4) Great way to get a product that we use often. The Coldwater Tide is great at cleaning our laundry. We use cold water for almost all the clothes we wash. I don't think I would want more than 4 bottles at a time. We can store that many."
5.00,"Tide Coldwater helps me reduce my energy bill. The only draw back is it's hard to find in my area. I hope this will change as more people discover how well it works."
5.00,"I ordered this more for convenience than anything else, but if you're shopping for a new detergent this one works great."
5.00,"The tide worked well and left no scent. I have problems with many items that claim that they are unscented but make me sneeze anyway. The tide did not."
5.00,"I really love this product for washing my 4 grown boys filthy work clothes but have a hard time finding it! I hate the Mountain Sring scent, which makes it even more difficult to find. Now that I went out and bought a front loader to conserve energy, I find you do not make cold water Tide in HE at all!"
5.00,"The detergent works well and since it is HE it's perfect for my front loading machine. The fresh scent is not too overpowering. The package deal price was excellent."
5.00,"I use this for all my laundry, all the time. If something is excessively dirty, I will spray it with a little stain remover before washing. Regardless, I wash everything on cold with this detergent and it always comes out fresh and clean."
5.00,"This detergent gets the stains and spots out that other detergents do not. We have tried the inexpensive brands. Specifically one powder product that came highly recommended from Consumer Reports. That product did not get a salsa stain out of a shirt. We washed the shirt again with this HE Tide, and the spot was gone. It may cost more, but save us money in the long run because we get more mileage out of our clothing."
5.00,"We are using this for our daughters clothes instead of Dreft. That is like $25 and this is MUCH cheaper!"
5.00,"I have done six loads of clothes with this new tide with fabreze and it does smell fresh. I like fabreze and I like tide so the combination is great. I do feel that tide is expensive but I guess if you want the best you have to pay the price. It is high energy and doesn't use a lot for each load, so you do save that way. I would purchase this product with no misgivings. Sheets, towels blankets as well as clothes came out smelling fresh and clean."
5.00,"Being a typical guy I've got \"favorite\" shirts. Luckily for me we started using COLDWATER TIDE, and even the ones that are getting old in years still look good enough to be on the hanger in a store... it's amazing! And as a bonus, not only is everything that goes through our washer still looking new, but we're saving major money each month on our energy bill. After the first few weeks of using COLDWATER TIDE we reset the hot water heater to the lowest setting, which is ample for showers, hand washing, and the dishwasher. Just this week, our comforter's cover got red Gatorade spilled on it. We blotted it off, then presoaked with COLDWATER TIDE, and washed it. NO STAIN: not even a trace remained... AWESOME!!! Thanks, TIDE!!!"
5.00,"I am a bargain shopper and have always purchased other brands of detergent but NO MORE! We have a toddler and her clothes get all types of crazy stains and Tide gets them out! Period! I love the smell too!"
5.00,"Purchased this 6 pack of ColdWater HE detergent at a great price, my wife says it works really well so I'll take her word for it :D"
5.00,"When Tide Coldwater first came out I read an online article, liked what I read, and requested and received a sample via mail. I had NEVER been a Tide user before...I grew up mostly on Gain Powder. But I liked the 'coldwater' idea. I tried the Tide Coldwater sample and was hooked. I went out and bought Tide Coldwater Powder and have never bought anything else since. When the Powder was taken off the shelves I didn't know where to turn. I had stocked up but knew that I would eventually run out. Then I found it online. Amazon's price and availabily, plus making purchases through Amazon.com before made it a no-brainer. I love that I can find the Powder at such a great price and have it shipped directly to me. Thanks to Tide for still making the Powder, and thanks to Amazon.com for providing the avenue to purchase it."
5.00,"This detergent did more to give me a great night's sleep than any mattress ever has. Think about it - you mash your face into the pillow or sheets all night long. If you're allergic to something in your detergent, at a minimum you don't sleep well and have minor respiratory issues while feeling groggy all day long. At the other end of the spectrum, you wake up with red/itchy skin on your face, wonky/puffy eyelids, and feeling like you were hit by a truck. This detergent has changed all of that."
5.00,"The Tide ColdWater with Actilift formula is the absolute BEST laundry cleaning product I have ever tried. My husband and I both get dirty, especially my husband while working. Soil, ground in and soaked in mud, grass, algae...very difficult stains to remove. This product gets out the stains, and in COLD water, saving us money with each load!"
4.00,"I like this detergent because it does not have a strong overpowering smell. A little goes a long way. I use 2 tablespoons to a full load the clothes come out clean and smelling great after each wash."
5.00,"Perfect for High Efficiency front loading washing machines. The clothes come out just very clean even with a small amount of the detergent."
4.00,"I see that some people have trouble with bottles leaking during shipment, but my order arrived with no leakage, although the box was pretty battered. I gave it only four stars because I find the scent pretty strange. It isn't nasty, just not what I expect my clothes to smell like. It's reminiscent of floor cleaners or antiseptic, rather than flowery or perfumey. I guess I'll get used to it, as I bought 4 bottles, and it does clean my clothes."
5.00,"Very economical. Sometimes have difficulty finding it on the shelves. Think most don't realize the benefits of this Coldwater laundry soap. Love it."
5.00,"We have used Tide cold water for a long time. Our household includes two small boys, four and seven, and all the predictable dirt and stains. We were happy with the Tide, but wanted to be more green. I have found this to clean fine in cold city water. It is also cheaper to use when ordered in bulk."
3.00,"I usually buy an all natural product that's for sensitive skin. I had read once that Tide (the regular version) caused a build up in HE machines. I had tried Tide before and hadn't experienced that, but it said it happened over time with regular use. Amazon had a coupon, a great price, and free shipping on a 2 pack of this Tide Free and Gentle so I thought I would give it a try. I would not typically buy detergent online. As far as skin sensitivity, I have not noticed any issues. The clothes seem clean, and I haven't had a problem with gunk build up with 1/2 a bottle used. So overall, I guess this stuff is okay, but once these are gone, I will go back to the natural detergent I was using. I have never had any sensitivity issues, it's comparably priced and haven't had any issues with build up over years of use. Besides, I'd rather use natural products, and it's also locally made."
5.00,"I love Tide and use the product over 20 years"
4.00,"I got in the habit of buying my laundry detergent in bulk at a local warehouse store so I used to purchase the gigantic bottles. Then I had a baby, and that trip to the warehouse store is just a hassle - so I turned to Amazon and these smaller bottles. Even though these bottles are much smaller than what I had been purchasing, they seem to last a really long time. I am a fan of being able to pour the detergent into the cup (and not having to use that obnoxious push ball thing a lot of the detergents have been moving towards) so I am starting to realize that I must have been using way too much before. Funny that a smaller bottle makes you use less, and the clothes look great after the wash!"
5.00,"Great for all my colored uniforms"
5.00,"Tide is the best every time. I keep going back to other brands to save money and it just does not get the same result."
5.00,"I read in Consumer Report that the Coldwater 2X Ultra Tide was a very good choice to use for cold water. So far, it has worked. Whites are just as white as if I had used hot water - save money on hot water. Very pleased with product."
4.00,"Great product but horrible smell(s) either of the two that are available are bad. Let's hear it for an unscented version of this super cold water detergent."
1.00,"Does a good job. I want to wash only on cold water, but I cannot find the POWDER version."
4.00,"With Subscribe and Save this was an incredible deal for a lot of detergent. However take note that like others, the product received is just the ColdWater HE Fresh Scent. There is no Actilift in this product. BUT, a quick chat with Amazon customer service explaining the discrepancy with their description got me a 20% refund on the order. I was offered a full refund to return the product, but couldn't pass up the savings. Overall, very happy with the deal. But Amazon really needs to update the description or update the product to match."
4.00,"Great for sensitive skin. It is unscented, but for someone with sensitive skin, it works so well. Would recommend, especially with the cheaper price."
5.00,"I've used a lot of different brands of detergent, but none stand up to the job that Tide does especially if you have a toddler who gets everything down their front. Get 90% of stains out without a pretreated. Gentle on clothes and skin. I do without the nice scents to avoid extra chemicals in my family's life. I've also tried using homemade detergents that I made myself, and while they were great getting sweat smells out of fabric, they did not have stain-fighting magic like Tide does. I'm a Tide fan for life."
1.00,"I used this detergent to wash the stain of one of my favorite shirts and to my horror, the color of the shirt came off! Yes I used cold water, no I did not let let soak for more than 1 min, and I did not use excessive amount, bleach, or any of the other common blunders. I was upset as shirt is bought while in Asia and no way I could replace it. I called the company and they were polite but were not too helpful other than telling me tips that anyone who launders would know. I would not recommend this to wash any of the better, nicer colored clothing."
1.00,"I never really use Tide because I had a bad experience in the past, but the store was out of All Free and Clear ( the brand I prefer). I decided to give it a try again, thinking maybe I was being paranoid. My BRAND NEW and EXPENSIVE ITALIAN SHEETS were RUINED by Tide Coldwater. They were 100% egyptian cotton and a light to medium purple color. I removed them from the washer yesterday to discover random light pink spots and discoloration. I do not own bleach and I have never even used it before. I had washed the sheet 3 times prior with All detergent and they came out beautiful and soft. I really cant believe this just happened to me. I had spent the entire summer saving up my money to buy high quality bed linen. I work so hard to keep them in great condition and this detergent ruined them. I'm very distraught and dont even want to look at my sheets because I get so upset. Do your self a favor and do not buy Tide, Tide Coldwater, or any Tide product. While it may or may not happen to you, it is really not worth taking the chance. Just believe me."
1.00,"i am really unhappy with the tide these days i have had several items of clothing ruined from the detergent leaving blue spots all over them especially the lighter clothes a big dissapointment for me and i have been loyal to tide for 30yrs"
3.00,"Purex works just as well and is much cheaper. I bought this because I thought it would clean better than my usual brand, but of course it did not."
5.00,"Often hard to find in stores though.....wonder why?"
5.00,"Wow what a great product. Not only does it clean well it saves energy. A win win situation. Have been using it for almost a year. We have even turned off the hot water supply to our washer. Buy it. You will be glad you did."
4.00,"Probably one of the best detergents out there for cleaning ability, consistency of scent and consistency of the product. No matter what, Tide cleans with (generally) less detergent needed than the competition (who may recommend half a cap when a full one is actually necessary to get the job done right). My only gripe is the price. Guess we are paying for the commercials but this stuff routinely runs nearly twice as much as the lesser varieties from equally large companies and in a tough economy that hurts. However, there is no denying this is one of the best detergents. Clothes do come out clean and fresh smelling and that earns at least 4 stars."
5.00,"Sometimes it doesn't seem to get my clothes quite as clean as a hot wash with hot water detergent, so I switch back to the classic stuff from time to time and do a hot water wash. I like getting the detergent with actilift so that I don't have to also get oxyclean, in the hope that the enzymes are about the same. In theory, this saves money and resources. I like the idea of being less wasteful and I like that this is specifically designed for cold water washing. I don't know how much different it really is from regular detergent (is it basically the same stuff and they just distinguish it to price discriminate?), but it seems to do well in cold water and you can buy it on Amazon in bulk so it lasts a long time."
5.00,"Thanks Tide!"
5.00,"I have used Tide Coldwater for years. After purchase of a new washing machine I needed the HE version of this product. Cleans very well in cold water."
5.00,"I use this on all of my laundry and have found that I can actually use about a quarter to half of what is recommended on the bottle and still get a really good clean. Does not bother my allergies or cause me to break out in hives."
4.00,"I agree it smells like cheap cologne, but almost all of the initial offensive odor dissipates by the end of the wash. Adding fabric softener sheets in the dryer eliminates even more. Admittedly I bought this scent to save the $14 over the \"preferred\" fresh scent. I feel the faint smell that remains after cleaning is not enough to spend the extra money on the fresh scent formula. I will happily buy it again to save the money."
5.00,"I'm glad that I ordered this product. I think that I got the best deal. Two for the price of one."
5.00,"Not sure why they came out with Cold Water Tide. I have been using Regular Tide in cold water for at lest 35 years and it always works great. No need to spend extra money for tide cold water."
3.00,"Tide's original laundry soap cleans much better. It seems more like a \"generic\" laundry soap that any company could make."
1.00,"I agree... this version of Tide stinks! Even my husband agrees. I have to wonder if it is even cleaning the clothes at all because my husband's shirts still have body odor after washing... or is that the Mountain Spring scent? Either way... I will not buy again!"
3.00,"Just bein' honest."
5.00,"I highly recommend this product and cleans better than any other detergent especially if you actually use warm or hot water with it."
5.00,"I was taught how to do laundry when I was 8years old. We always used TIDE. When I Asked why, my foster mom said because it never fails me. Stains are gone and colors are Brite. So as I grew up I still use TIDE at age 52 and am loving it. Thank you."
5.00,"I actually read reviews on this detergent that the smell is horrible. Well seems like it just smells like any other Tide. Tide always smells great especially my favorite Tide Totalcare. I wanted to try something new and I only use cold water for laundry so I thought I'd give this a try. It cleans just as well as others. But I may go back to the regular Tide with actilift as I think it does get the stains better."
5.00,"With a family of 6, we go through a lot of detergent. So, I am constantly looking for good deals on detergent!"
1.00,"I'm not sure how this works. Not sure if I will send back or not. I was highly disappointed by the lack of Actilift as was stated in the product description. Beware. I probably should have read the reviews before purchasing."
5.00,"I use to use Tide faithfully.  I bought the largest container I could find because it was cheaper and I only shopped once a month.  Lately, with the enconomy being what it is, I was forced to cut back on spending and honestly, Tide is not the cheapest laundry soap availiable, but it was my favorite.  I found this deal on Amazon.com and I had a credit that I could use so I ordered a 6pk of Tide Coldwater for my HE washer. I also got free supersaver shipping. Then I had plenty of credit from giftcards so my total out of pocket for my entire order was free!!! And delivered to my door within a week!!! How can you beat that? I am so happy that I am able to afford to use Tide again!"
5.00,"This is a great detergent and a great deal when Amazon has on sale. Just keep in mind that I think Tide changed the packaging as it does not say Actilift on the bottles."
5.00,"The Tide Coldwater really works well and gets your clothing clean without the residue."
5.00,"Tide is the greatest! It's just too bad that Tide Colwater Powder is no longer available. xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx"
5.00,"I love this really cleans clothes and they smell great"
5.00,"If you have shopped your local stores for Tide HE liquid, you know there are about a million choices out there with every additive in the world added to Tide.  However, if you want Tide Free, you really have only 2 choices, Tide Free &amp; Clear and Tide Free for Coldwater.  If you search the other way, and look for Tide Coldwater HE, there are 2 choices, Tide Coldwater with original scent and Tide Free for Coldwater.  The one with original scent absolutely wreaks with a perfume.  Even after wearing the clothes and throwing them into the dirty clothes hamper the scent is still there.                                                                     For various reasons many of us find it imperative to use an unscented detergent that is capable of cleaning well in cold water; therefore only one Tide fits this bill:  Tide Free for Coldwater HE.  My supermarkets do not stock this item although they stock about 7 or 8 varieties of Tide detergents.                                                                     Comparing this to what my supermarket does stock, the Tide Free for Coldwater HE in the 75 oz size is several dollars more expensive per bottle.  I made a little better deal by having a standing order for 4 to be delivered every 4 or 5 months.  Since I have no other source to purchase the Coldwater Tide Free, I feel this is an acceptable deal.  If I just wanted the Tide Free aspect, purchasing Tide Free &amp; Clear HE which would be used in warm water would be a much better bargain.                                                                     I can find no fault with the product itself.  It does a good job in my HE machine.  I am very happy with it."
5.00,"I'm not understanding the reviews that complain about these being 25oz. I got mine and they were both 50oz bottles for a total of 100ozs. So good in fact I'm here to buy more!"
1.00,"I was a loyal customer of the Original Tide for Coldwater (Not acti lift cold water) but due to not being able to find the original Tide for Coldwater I chaged to the one with Acti Lift. I do not like it. When I used Acti Lift Tide it ruined my clothes with streaks of stains like bleach stains. I continue to look for the original Tide for Coldwater but realize that you have discontinued making it. I would really like to see you bring back the ORIGINAL TIDE FOR COLD WATER without the Acti Lift."
1.00,"Tide Coldwater is the WORST product I have ever used! I used to be a loyal Tide user, but after using the coldwater I discovered random spots on my husband's work shirts, then again noticed bluish/purple spots on ALL our white load. This product cost my family hundreds of dollars to buy new clothes. (I always put the detergent in the water first then load the clothes in for those who question how I do laundry) This product is HORRIBLE. Don't waste your money!! You will end up buying a new wardrobe..."
4.00,"The laundry machines in my apartment complex are evil. They have all kinds of buttons for different modes, but the machine gives everything full power no matter what button is pushed. Therefore, I prefer to hand-wash my favorite and delicate shirts (even those which are labeled as machine washable). If a shirt is exceptionally nasty, normal detergent can require more than one wash/rinse routine. This \"coldwater\" stuff seems to work in one shot for almost everything. The only thing wrong with this stuff is it is full of some kind of useless scent. It goes away fairly quick for clothing on hangers."
4.00,"For some reason I can't find coldwater 2x anymore. I was hoping walmart had it, and obviously in the name it is 2x. However, I received regular coldwater. Still washes well, and maybe the coldwater and coldwater 2x ultra may in fact be the same thing, I still wanted the ultra 2x. No walmarts near me, so shipping back three of these would've been a hassle. Regardless, washing with coldwater is effective and saves on heating bills!"
5.00,"i love tide and love the fact that i can have this on subscribe and save and get it delivered to my house. the price is same as if i was waiting for it to go on sale and stocking up coupons. much less of a hassle to buy this way."
5.00,"We use this in our LG front-loader (requires HE detergent). We prefer using cold water and lighter cycles to help preserve our clothes. For these cycles, this detergent is perfect. The combination of the efficient washer and this detergent really makes a noticeable difference to our eyes. We previously used the cheapest \"generic\" detergents that worked with our washer. And frankly didn't believe there was much of a difference. But for whatever reason, this honestly seems to do a better job."
4.00,"I particularly like that this product covers my gray very well while at the same time being easy to use. I'm not sure what % gray my hair is, but the gray occurs in large patches rather than salt and pepper. After coloring, the patches are a nice black consistent with the rest of my hair. You're not required to shampoo the usual 24 hours before application, there's no lather-and-rinse needed (only rinse and then condition), and you leave it on for only a maximum of 15 minutes (rather than 45 min.). It leaves my hair very soft and manageable. And the color blends nicely from one application to the next. I color new growth once a month (but probably should do it once every three weeks). I have no idea how many shampoos the color would last. Being black and wearing my hair naturally (i.e., no chemical or heat straightening) and minimizing the use of oily hair products, I don't have to shampoo very often; usually once (sometimes twice) a week. Like most black hair color shades, this product frequently goes out of stock in the local stores and you may have to order online (even in that case this shade in this particular product was difficult to find at a reasonable price and shipping charge). I've often wondered why they don't just manufacture more (unless shortage of materials is the real issue). Regarding the shipping by my seller (123 Deals from A to Z on Amazon Marketplace), they shipped quickly. However, the packaging left something to be desired. The 3 boxes I ordered were shipped in a bubble pack envelope and arrived well beaten up. Thankfully, none of the bottles of fluid were compromised. Why not 5 stars? Nothing's perfect. The last time I colored, some of the new growth came out dark brown instead of black (that happens with difficult-to-color gray hair). But who's to say what caused that? Maybe my hair chemistry was a little different or maybe I did something different. But it wasn't noticeable and was not a problem. I like this product better than other hair color products I've tried (even those by Clairol) because it covers the gray well, is easy and fast to apply, and leaves my hair soft and manageable."
5.00,"I can no longer find the Clairol Nice 'N Easy Non-Permanent hair colors in stores near me, so I had to turn to the internet. I was a little worried about ordering them online, but the product I received was exactly as it would have been had I purchased it in a local drug store. Very happy and arrived quickly and without any packaging damage."
3.00,"The product is ok overall. Watch the color. This turned out more red than brown on me but I am told that I have some red in my hair."
2.00,"This is better than the other Clairol non-permanent dye at blending and covering grays, but the ash brown color has a greenish tint that is really, REALLY ugly. I wish Clairol would offer a purple base for cool brown colors instead of this green ash color. It also dyed my hair unevenly because the gray hairs came out lighter than the non-gray, so in certain light, my hair looks a bit striped. *sigh* My search for a good non-permanent hair color continues...."
5.00,"I really like this product. Good color; last long enough; easy on use. It is too bad that Clairol is not making it any longer. Decided to stock up while I could get it."
1.00,"I've used this brand and color (medium ash brown) twice now, trying to find a brand that doesn't oxidize to red. With this product the color is very good, although maybe a touch darker than the images on the box display. There's zero shine. I'm noticing lots of hair that looks \"broken\", like super split ends, where I usually have none. There's much less oxidation than with the Garnier Nutrisse I was using, but ... and this is one BIG but ..., there is a BUNCH of hair in the drain after my shower, where usually there is none. I have short hair. It's not falling out in chunks or anything, but there is definitely hair loss going on; it's probably all the broken strands. I'm definitely done with this brand and will move along to try something else, or maybe even :gulp: head to the salon and pay for professional color."
1.00,"I ordered this product because the box looked exactly like the Clairol Nice' Easy Non-Permanent Hair Color 77 Medium Ash Brown I have used for years. I buy extra hair coloring products so that I never run out. I have the older version and the current version so I compared the boxes. The box for the current version is slightly larger than the older version and to my surprise when I looked at the back of the box Hydrogen Peroxide is clearly listed as an ingredient. The box for the older version does NOT contain Hydrogen Peroxide. I should have realized when I read the one review posted for this item [the reviewer said this product caused their hair to fall out] that the ingredients in this product had changed. Amazon has already emailed me a return label so that I can return this product."
1.00,"I usually use Clairol Natural Instincts to touch up roots. I bought this Nice 'n Easy box because it was half price at the grocery store. This is the messiest, drippy-est hair coloring I've ever used. I can usually put the color on and go about my business for 20 minutes. With this color, I had to stand at the sink and swipe at the rivers of color running down my face and neck with wads of paper towel. What a mess! No wonder it was on clearance."
1.00,"This was the first time I used this product, which I bought at a store. More of it ended up on my bathroom surfaces than stayed on my head. It didn't even stay on my head long enough to color my hair completely, much less cover the grey. The color came out erratic and then after one washing, changed to a more reddish shade. Worst hair color I've ever used. Can't believe it's been on the market so long. I think it's got to be manufactured by people in the home improvement industry because you're going to destroy your bathroom, no lie!"
3.00,"not so good for gray coverage. but the color was soft. package came crumpelt. shampoo inside leaked over the rest of my order."
3.00,"The color was great...it was very black and worked well for what I needed to use it for (a costume, but I didn't care about having my hair dark for 6 weeks). However, it took a few months to get out of my hair. This may have been because I've never died my hair, but buyer beware."
5.00,"Love it! Delivery was quick and packaging was awesome, even gave me a free gift I was not expecting! Love it. Great company and the product is good. I have used it and love the results! Non permanent hair color is less damaging to my hair and lasts as long as the permanent given how fast my hair grows. I love it!"
5.00,"I have shoulder length salt and pepper hair that's naturally darker underneath. It used to be dark brown. I think the top is really white hair now , so I'd be a little hesitant to color that.. so I thought I'd try something different. I bought #79 Dark Brown, and #82 Black non permanent color. I sectioned my hair into 3 sections, the top, the middle , and the bottom - in about equal parts. My neighbor helped me - The top I left alone, the middle she put on the dark brown, and the bottom the black. SHe just twisted up the hair after the color application and fastened it with a plastic claw clip. I used a plastic shopping bag around my neck and an old T shirt. But surprisingly it wasn't very messy. I let it stay on longer than the recommended 15 minutes - it was more like 25. Then I let down the bottom 2 layers and showered with warm water. I had sprayed the walls and floor of the shower with \" non offensive smelling shower cleaner\" because I wasn't sure of the mess. The shower cleaned right up without problems. IT LOOKS GREAT!.. And my hair is soft.. Next- we'll see if it really lasts 6 to 8 weeks - if so, I may just keep this up!. This is a great product!"
5.00,"I got this for my wife and she loved it. The color looks beautiful and the product was very easy to use. We will buy again."
5.00,"I am unable to find this non-perm product in my stores. And it's great 3 at a time so I don't have to order so often."
5.00,"Has a nice color and hasn't really fade like most boxed haircolors do. It is a very nice product. good."
5.00,"Finally I found a product and a color that works for me, and Clairol is discontinuing it. I bought as many as I could find at Amazon before the product disappeared altogether. It's so easy to use that I can apply it every three weeks and never have any fading. It leaves my hair with a nice texture and a perfect color. I'm not confident that Clairol's replacement product will do what I want, but I won't need to try it for several months."
3.00,"I have NEVER EVER colored my hair before, but my grays were getting so terrible that I needed to try something. I do not have a full head of gray, but just enough that every time I pull my hair back in a ponytail, they are all that you see. I was really worried that I would regret being cheap and not going to the salon, but I had no time and little money. After reading reviews and talking with some friends, I had heard that Clairol was the way to go. I took a deep breath and went for it. I chose non-permanenat because the box said it was great for first timers. Amazingly, I picked the color that was almost an exact match for the deepest shade of my hair. I was so thankful I did not end up with Redhead or Orangehead. On the down side, IT DID NOT COVER MY GRAYS. Ok.....well, it may have slightly covered half of three of them, but that was it. My hair does look shinier so it is hiding them better than before, but I was hoping they would be gone. I am going to try their permanent line and will let you know how it goes."
5.00,"I love the 815r Deep mahogany auburn hair color. It covers the white hair very well. It's too bad they stop making this color."
2.00,"Easy to use but it has left a slight reddish tint on normal brown hair which is visible in bright light - warmer than any other ash brown I have ever used so I will be looking for something else next time."
1.00,"This product left my hair feeling dry and fragile. I wish they would bring back the old Loving Care temporary. Color didn't last as long, but at least my hair didn't become like straw."
1.00,"So I dyed my hair this color for fun. I'm a natural blonde and was like, hey, why not try something different? It'll wash out! No problem. Well, haha, let me tell you why not. This is NOT non-permanent in some respects. The color was true the night I dyed it, but one wash and it was dull! It washed out pretty quickly and I had this strange color that was awful, so I decided I would try to fix my mistake. I bought L'Oreal ColorOops! and a box of Garnier extra light blonde to fix it. No problem. ColorOops! dissolves permanent hair dye, so non-permanent should be a non-problem, right? Wrong. The color was lightened substantially, but it was obvious my hair was still brown-red. Whatever, I kind of expect that from ColorOops!, but I've always been able to just color over that. Well, I used my extra light blonde to find...NO CHANGE. My hair was still reddish-brownish-maybe-a-little-dark-blonde-y? So I left it like this for a day so that my hair could rest then went and bought what my natural color is - the Garnier Light Golden Blonde color. I put it in and... NO CHANGE! So I bought John Freida's Go Blonder shampoo, conditioner, and spray and used that for 10 days. It lightened a bit, so I thought perhaps this time it would work. I dyed my hair Garnier's Light Golden Blonde AGAIN only to have a very small change. My hair is still a hideous not quite blonde, not quite brown, not quite red, but I'm terrified to bleach it (which feels the only solution to this terror) because I've been doing so much to it in the past couple weeks. So, no, I am NOT happy with Clairol Nice 'N Easy Non-Permanent Hair Color 79 Dark Brown. So much for a shade to just test drive, I'm going to have ugly hair for all of Christmas because I dyed my hair at the beginning of November. And I'm out a ton of money on 3 boxes of hair dye, the special shampoo and conditioner, the lightening spray, and a box of L'Oreal Feria Extreme Platinum that I HOPE will save me. What a NIGHTMARE!"
3.00,"I bought this hair color because I am trying to grow out my highlights naturally without an obvious line. My hope was that if I used a non-permanent hair color close to my natural color it would cover the highlights and naturally grow/fade to look like my natural color. While I do think the method works, I wouldn't call this color \"ash\" at all. My natural hair color is very close to the color on the box, what I would call a medium cool brown, but the effect of this dye, even on my natural hair, is brassy. It still looks nice, but I think the \"ash\" in the name is misleading. If you are trying to avoid any orange hues, I would not recommend this product"
1.00,"This product did not cover my grays one bit. Have used plenty of other non-permanent products that did a great job. This was not one of them."
5.00,"wanted color that's gentle- but I LOVE the conditioner, wish I could but the conditioner itself! Another product that been discontinued! Thank goodness for Amazon!"
4.00,"It is difficult to find in stores as lots of new products fill shelves... would recommend to anybody that wants results. Caveat- you need to test it as you might be allergic to any of the components as with any other brand. Just follow directions."
5.00,"The dye was easy to apply and worked well. It only just starting to wash out two months later and my natural color blends with it."
5.00,"It's a perfect color for my complexion and makes me feel younger looking back at myself in the mirror. Even a beautician complimented me on the choice of color."
4.00,"Okay well I died my hair with this about a month ago and the color is amazing but Its still in my hair and not fading. I am going into the new school year next month and I want my hair color back. It was just suppose to be a hey 1 week dye for last day of school but its lasting a very long time. Its a beautiful color just be aware that its not THAT temporary."
5.00,"I gave this product a five, because my Mom uses it. She gets severe reactions from most hair colors, and she has used this for years with beautiful, safe results. She loves it! Please continue this line...its not always easy to obtain, Thanks for all of your help!"
2.00,"The color does last a long time but it made my soft hair knot up and feel like straw. It also was a dull color and no shine. I also do not like the fact that you have to mix this. Due to it having to be mixed you have to you use the product right away and throw away what is left over. I only use a small amount on my bangs so 3/4 of the bottle is wasted. I only purchased this because I love this in the cream (no mixing) but the cream only last 6-12 shampoos where this one last up to 24. I will definitely not use this one again but go back to the cream one that gives shine and doesn't make my hair fell like knotted up straw. The seller was awesome with fast shipping though!"
4.00,"I've used it for 20 years under the other name. I depend on it, but I mix it with another color. from Ann"
5.00,"I loved the hair color and I would order it again.....it lasted as long as the box said it would."
5.00,"I have tried to buy every package of this hair color, because it is no longer made. I love this stuff, and the color is true to its packaging."
1.00,"I bought this color, light ash brown, specifically because it \"layers cool tones and minimizes red/orange undertones\". However, it left my hair orange...ORANGE! The exact opposite of what it advertised, and precisely what I was trying to avoid. I've been washing my hair every day, hoping it will wash out as quickly as possible. Disaster...I hate it, and will never buy a Clairol product again."
5.00,"This product is no longer available in retail stores. It is the perfect type of hair color (non-permanent) and shade (dark blonde) for me. I was so happy to find this product online. If Clairol is no longer making Nice 'N Easy non-permanent hair color, I hope they will come out with another line of Non-Permanect Hair Color to replace it, .Non-permanent hair color is hard to find."
5.00,"There is no longer any NON permanent hair color being produced. The semi perm & permanent hair colors are toxic. Hopefully I bought enough to last until someone fills the void and we again have the choice of non-permanent hair color."
5.00,"I am naturally DARK brown with grays. I had had my hair colored at a salon with permanent color as the salon continues to insist that that is the only way to lighten hair (which is incorrct). Because of my grays, my hair does lighten a bit with this product. My hair is VERY thin/ balding and I have tried permanent color enough to know that it ALWAYS damages my hair. From the salon, the reddishness was becoming brassy, so I used this brand and light ash brown color to tone down that orange hue. (It even mentions this on the box). I have tried other non-permanent colors with other non-permanent hair color (Healthy Look and Natural Instincts). This brand and this color works best for me. I had tried the light brown, but I prefer light ASH brown...It's more natural looking and pretty. Make sure to get the NON-permanent box. (It has the purple strip across bottom of box; boxes for permanent color look very similar)."
4.00,"This Hair color is easy to apply and the result is very nice. My hair feels soft and the color looks nature."
5.00,"color is wonderful. Ihave been looking for a non permanent hair color ever since Loving Care was discontinlued and finally seem to have found it."
2.00,"Does not cover gray. Gives it a dirty blonde color and then your darker hair is still dark. Another words, why bother coloring your hair..."
4.00,"This covers my gray but only covers my gray hairs for about 3 weeks. I use a lighter shade on my mostly \"pepper\" (as in \"salt and pepper\" natural hair.) My hair dresser commented, without my asking, that it looked like highlights."
4.00,"I felt it might be an old box. It did not seem to cover the gray as well as usual. This is the brand I always use and generally I get pretty solid coverage."
1.00,"This product was not the same as \"Loving Care.\" I'm allergic to anything other than Loving Care. Igt contained 2 bottles for mixing. The one I usually buy is one bottle. I had to return them, and buy the other Nice N Easy Loving Care Dark Brown. That is comperable to the Loving Care that was discontinued in the U.S."
4.00,"I have been platinum blonde my entire life and decided I was sick of the breakage and high end products that never worked. I bought 2 of these to completely cover my thick hair. It worked amazing to coverage my hair so I am sure it would be great for other's as well. I did not give it 5 stars because even though the coverage was great, the conditioner is just Pantene, and there's not very much of it. Excellence by L'Oreal is MUCH better."
3.00,"I shouldn't have bought it. It's not permanent. It said so, but I didn't notice. Good price, but who would want non-permanent color?"
5.00,"I use this product to color my hair about every 6 weeks to cover grey and even out the color as I grow out all the old permanent color left over from old dye jobs. Since I have to do it so often to keep up with the new growth, it works just as well as permanent without the damage. I get good, even coverage and a nice rich color for a good price!"
5.00,"I purchased this at my local drugstore and I am so happy I tried this one ! It actually turns out a medium neutral brown! I was doing ash shades trying to keep so much red out, with this one its not brassy but not ashy.. I love it! the perfect BROWN . I am getting ready to reorder , this time from amazon!"
3.00,"Didn't really work for me. However, it probably has more to do with fact that my hair is difficult to color the gray."
4.00,"The box was a little torn & open when I received it, but everything else inside the box was in tact and unopened."
1.00,"I received Clairol Nice'N'Easy non permanent NO AMMONIA last up to 28 shampoos - what I wanted was Clairol Nice'N'Easy non permanent NO AMMONIA AND NO PEROXIDE lasts up to 8 shampoos. I cannot use products which contain ammonia and peroxide. I have used this product for decades and have always been happy with it. I have been unable to find another hair colour which DOES NOT contain ammonia and peroxide. Unfortunately It has now become very difficult to locate the Nice'N'Easy no ammonia and no peroxide."
1.00,"For years I used L'Oreal Color Spa with great results, then as with all good products it was discontinued. I bought everything I could find and finally ran out. Clairol seemed the best alternative for a grown-up hair color. I don't have a lot of extra time and often go longer between colorings than would be recommended for a permanent hair color which is why the wash away color is so great. It fades as the roots grow out and there is no distinct root line between the colored and my non-colored salt and pepper hair. I didn't mind that my hair is a little more gray, it would look natural. Clairol Nice n Easy \"Non-Permanent\" Hair color seems to be Permanent. It's been almost 3 months and my hair is still dull and jet black - except for my salt and pepper roots which stands out against the colored hair like a flashing sign. I've been washing my hair almost daily trying to fade the color with no luck. As I mentioned above the color is not dark brown - it's jet \"shoe polish\" black with no shine. One plus is that there is no harsh smell. Right now I'm torn, because I want to get rid of my grey roots, but I can't find a Non-Permanent color that I trust."
3.00,"Didn't really work for me. However, it probably has more to do with fact that my hair is difficult to color the gray. ( I give up, I have tried many different Nice 'N Easy products, but noe worked for me."
5.00,"To a Senior citizen, this is a gift. I smile back at myself when I see my reflection in the mirror. It gives back years."
1.00,"Don't know what went wrong with this product which was described as light brown but turned my hair RED. I have light brown hair with gray, naturally, and certainly did not want red hair. I look ridiculous and don't know what to do next."
5.00,"This is an improvement over the old Clairol non-permanent formula. They did away with the worthless color enhancer that was supposed to be put on after two weeks, which gave my hair a really nasty texture. The old formula came off on the hair-drying towel for days. This one doesn't do that, although I'm careful to use a dark towel to dry my hair for the first couple of days. Even though I have considerable gray hair to cover, the color lasts me three weeks before it starts to fade. I hope that Clairol sticks with this formula."
5.00,"I checked a couple of stores and all they had was the permanent color. I want the one that lasts 28 washes easier on roots showing. Easy to use and sometimes it lasts longer than the 28 washes."
5.00,"I didn't purchase this product from amazon, I found it on clearance at my local Ulta store. However, I loved the results. I am 23, no grays, but I did have some bleached highlights. This product happens to be close to my natural color and covered my highlights nicely. This certainly is a non-permanent product though and I had to recolor with another box about a month or so later. I think next time I will go with the permanent version which is suggested by Clairol to be Natural Dark Champagne Blonde 106B. Very pleased!"
1.00,"The coloring is amazing, not the easiest application and lasted much longer, all I can say is thank God hair grows I still have the color I put on and I'm not happy about that"
5.00,"I love the product it is fast and easy to put on. I am sensitive and allergic to some hair colors. I am not allergic to this product that makes it great to use."
5.00,"I have to admit that I am uncomfortable with change, but when a product works so well, why try anything else? I started using Pantene in college, and I am still using it 25+ years later. It has changed over the years, so I have gone with the flow by choosing the specific product for my hair type. I have very long (to my waist), very thick, somewhat coarse hair that is starting to gray a tad. All of those issues can be real problems for hair products, but Pantene has always been great for me. I don't go to the salon often, but every time I do, the stylist is highly impressed by the health and shine in my hair. I have next to no damage, so split ends and friz are a non-issue. One bit of advice, though, is that I do use the shampoo plus conditioner product THEN I use the conditioner product as well. You just have to find what works for your hair."
4.00,"I received this product via Amazon Vine. I am not a big believer in most advertisement. However, this product really does make my hair feel more luxurious, and more resilient. I color my hair about 2-3x/year, and while I love the color, the process does make the hair feel more brittle. Of note, I have thick black straight hair. Since I've started using this, I've noticed that the hair has starting to resume some of the original fullness and strength. I am not sure how I can comment on the \"AgeDefy\" part since I am probably not of that age demographic and I have been only using this for 2 months. I consider this a very good product, probably one of the most useful things I got to try on Amazon. The only other thing I have noticed that I should bring up is that I seem to need to wash my hair more often, as it seem to make my hair feel more oily sooner. Overall, a solid product."
5.00,"I like this and have been using it for about a yr now. I cut out all colr and am growing out natural Tones down the grey and my hais is noit so brassy. Will keep buying"
3.00,"After using this shampoo, my hair still feels weighed down, and the next day my hair gets this clumped, piece-y texture. It's gross. Maybe the shampoo clarifies but also adds in a LOT of moisture; maybe it is supposed to be used for curly or coarse hair types. I used the Suave rosemary mint clarifying shampoo and that really keeps my hair fresh."
3.00,"I actually ordered Panteen pro- v Time Renewal Shampoo and Conditioner knowing it had been discontinued. I hoped to stock up on the original product. I received 5 tubes of Shampoo and 5 tubes of conditioner of the new product Beautiful Lengths. This product is not bad, but is not nearly as good as the original product 'TimeRenewal'. The original product kept my hair from drying out, the new one doesn't. This is certainly not Amazon's fault. Amazon is great."
5.00,"I received one bottle of this shampoo from the Vine program. I requested it for my wife who used it and declared it to be a top notch product. She read the claims and found them to be trustworthy. The shampoo does an excellent lathering job and emits a pleasant smell. It does a superlative cleaning job while leavimg the hair feeling soft. This is a worthy product and has become the shampoo of choice here in Dufferville."
5.00,"This is also helping me to get my once straight hair back. But again it needs to be offered in a larger size. But overall it is a really GOOD deal!"
5.00,"I have very thick, plentiful, wavy hair, and this is the first shampoo I've used that does not dry out my hair. Previously, I've had to purchase 2-in-1s (shampoo + conditioner), which are hard to find in bulk discount, or I've had to purchase conditioner separately to prevent my hair from drying out. With this product, I no longer need to purchase conditioner separately, and I am greatly enjoying the discount that comes with buying in bulk!"
5.00,"Smells delicious and works wonderfully. I would definetely reccomend it to my friends and family."
1.00,"I've never bought this offline, only from drugstores, and not even I bought it it's the only thing my mom buys. Well, whenever I run out of my shampoos, I have to use this one and I hate it. The smell has changed variously over the years, never liked it and after a while it really dries my hair out. I will stick to my professional shampoos."
5.00,"Not only is this shampoo made by a trusted brand, a little goes a long way.  The bottle lasts a long time.  The scent is just amazing and refreshing.  I enjoy this shampoo and will definitely buy it again!"
3.00,"This shampoo is good but I prefer the classic clean, which they sent me the classic shampoo which is different from the classic clean. I wish the people at Pantene had not stopped making the clarifying shampoo that was the best. Since I am unable to buy Pantene clarifying shampoo the classic clean was pretty close. I love Pantene products and use them all the time. If you get a chance to purchase the Classic Clean shampoo then I highly recommend it but just the classic shampoo - you might as well pick up something else."
5.00,"I subscribed to this product for its price and convenience--that is short for saving gas. She has used it for years and will not use or even try any other product. Her hair is always clean and sweet smelling. Add the conditioner and your wife will have the softest, slinkiest hair on your block."
1.00,"I used this shampoo for years. However, about 2 month ago they must have changed something in the formula. Suddenly, I got a terrible rush - could not even sleep at night, it itched so much. Took me about a week to figure out this shampoo was the cause. Using any other shampoo caused the issue to go away. I wish they would somehow notify of ingredient changes. And I hope this was not some sort of quality issue in shampoo manufacturing - this would be even more disturbing for me,"
5.00,"My hair tends to curl up, especially when it is humid. This product is perfect for that need. Since I can no longer find this product in stores, finding it on Amazon was a relef."
5.00,"Love the pump!!...so easy to use on the shower shelf, just pump and use. No flipping tops, no unscrewing tops, just pump and your done. And its a great shampoo. Not harsh, a little goes a long way."
5.00,"I find the Pantene Flat to Volume shampoo to be my favorite. ...it keeps your hair filled with body..not flat.The only bad thing is that is is a discontinued product, it has been replaced by the new VOLUME shampoo which isn't at all what the name suggests..it is not the same! So my search continues..checking drug stores, dollar stores grocery stores..etc. always looking for the original and sometimes finding it only in the travel size which is better than nothing!"
2.00,"FYI, I just received this in the mail and it is one bottle not two like in the image. I like this product but am disappointed that the image does not represent what I actually received."
5.00,"I used to have a frizzy mane of hair, and had no idea how to fix it. Turns out, the key is in not using the same shampoo as the rest of your (straight haired!) household. This stuff helped turn my hair from frizzy disaster into cute curls. I only wish someone had told me about it back in high school, when I thought a straightening iron was the only salvation."
5.00,"This shampoo works great for me. I have used Head &amp; Shoulders for years and needed a change. Pantene pro-v Anti-dandruff worked as well as or better than H &amp; S.  The only problem is amazon.com doesn't carry it."
1.00,"This product is horrible. It made my hair extremely dry and staticky. I stopped using this product and tried another one. My hair, then, improved drastically. Stay away from this product."
5.00,"I have very curly hair and after years of using all types of products on my hair for curl control, I finally found the one that works- Pantene for Curls! The shampoo and conditioner smooths and defines my curls like no other product I have ever used. It has proven itself during the last few weeks when I switched to a different brand once I ran out of Pantene. My curls went back to frizz and they weren't staying together (like in spirals). It looked awful. So I immediately bought Pantene for Curls again-- there was no comparison to the difference! It is the only product I intend on using now :)"
3.00,"I have curly hair and it's always on the dry side. This shampoo seems to have the opposite effect for me instead of moisturizing it has dried my hair and scalp. In addition the smell of the shampoo while nice at first becomes less appealing after using the shampoo for awhile. I'll be using the rest of this shampoo as I don't like to waste but once it's gone I won't be purchasing it again."
5.00,"makes my dry thick hair silky smooth. If this is too heavy for you then you are clearly using the wrong product."
4.00,"This product is a good deal.  I don't understand why Pantene discontinued this item. Pantene made a big mistake. It make your hair very shinny and smooth.  I like it because of the way it makes my hair look and feel. I would recommend this product to anyone."
4.00,"I have been using this product along with the matching conditioner for the last several weeks. My hair is naturally curly, and does tend to frizz. With all of the thunder and lightening storms we have had over the last few weeks, I have had an excellent chance to test out this conditioner vs the mother nature induced frizz. I personally tend to swap between Herbal Essences and Pantene about every other bottle, so I am no stranger to Pantene products. What I have noticed about this shampoo/ conditioner: 1) The shampoo is runnier then the normal Pantene, so when you first use it, be careful because it's easy to run it over your hand and waste some of it. 2) The scent is nice, though nowhere near as potent or long lasting as the original Pantene products. 3) My hair did stay more \"calm\" although this could be because of the buildup that Pantene is known for. 4) I didn't find that my hair was any smoother to the touch then when using the Herbal Essenses or other Pantene. In fact it actually FELT a little rougher then after using the other Pantene products. In conclusion - I'm not sure that I would spend extra money on this line of products, but I certainly didn't find anything wrong with them. I would have a hard time buying Pantene products and not having that smell that I so love. Still if this is your hair type and you have frizz issues, you might at least want to give this a try. It's no miracle but it can help a bit."
5.00,"I have very thin hair, and I shower and rinse my hair everyday. It shines from morning till the end of the day."
5.00,"this really works. my hair is shinier than when i used conventional shampoo and is well mannered. very pleased. also using conditioner. this will surprise when you see that it is purple but it does the job well."
5.00,"I have very thin, fine hair. As I have gotten older that has become an issue with breakage, so much so that I had handfuls of hair in the drain in the morning when using other shampoos meant for strengthening hair (Clear). I thought this was just what I'd have to deal with until I found the AgeDefy product line. Within 3 uses - 3!! - I had only a few strands of breakage in the shower compared to the amount I'd had just days before. Amazing!! Will admit this works better when paired with the AgeDefy serum but even on days when I have missed using that I have much less breakage and my hair is wonderfully shiny and soft."
5.00,"Works great and is gentle on your hair. Easy to use and see results as you move through your week. Definitely the way to go!"
5.00,"This is what my wife uses an her hair almost touches the ground an it works very well for her long thick hair!"
4.00,"This works well as a shampoo. Not so great as a conditioner but I expected that. I always use another conditioner on top of this as my hair is thick and curly."
5.00,"I was in Colorado not to long ago on vacation, and I wanted to go swimming. Well I brought shampoo that's to get the crap out of hair with the spray in conditioner. My hair started getting very very dry. Well I didn't go swimming on the third or fourth day, and I was desperate for shampoo and conditioner that wouldn't dry my hair out like it has been. Well I looked at what the hotel had and usually it's not that great, well it was this with the conditioner, I figured what did I have to lose? So I got done with my shower, and I was amazed how great this stuff is! I didn't even have to use leave in conditioner like I always do. So soft!! Then I got home, where the water is a lot better! And took my shower with it a few days later, since I went back to using my regular stuff. Well I'm impressed a lot, no having to use leave in conditioner either. And I had less shedding. My hair type is wavy, little bit below waist length, I'm growing it out towards my tailbone. I always have to use leave in conditioner and use deep conditioner on a daily basis. I get split ends and hair breakage, and they said your hair can't split along the hair shaft, well mine does. I will have to use this on a month to month basis and see if it improves that, I hate split ends!"
5.00,"It is great shampoo with the added advantage of imparting a hint of color. I will continue using it forever."
5.00,"I used head and shoulders before. Switched to try this stuff out and I was blown away. The texture of my hair is so smooth and soft now. My hair is also so shiny and I've only used this stuff twice. This shampoo and the conditioner make a great duo. New holy grail! And I can't complain about the price either :)"
4.00,"I have thin hair and have used Pantene over the years, but have always found it to be much to heavy and it always had a tendency to weigh down my hair. This shampoo is much lighter, but still cleans very well and smell terrific. My hair isn't weighed down at all by this and it's fresh, clean and soft. It definitely has a little more bounce to it. I'm impressed with the results after using it for a few weeks. The price @ Amazon is a bit expensive. I haven't seen it in stores yet, but I'm not sure it's worth nearly 6 dollars a bottle. That's twice what normal Pantene costs at my local drug store. One thing, you definitely do need a conditioner with this shampoo, at least for my hair."
1.00,"I used to use Dove but then wanted to try out this product because I heard so many good reviews on this. However after a few washes, I realized how this shampoo was totally drying out my hair and overtime created dry, brittle strands. I am very displeased with this product... I switched back to Dove (:"
1.00,"I ordered the medium thick and received the normal thick shampoo. Tried to return but shampoos are not eligible. No further comment."
5.00,"You really don't have to buy any fancy shampoos at your hair salon when you can buy this one. Really first class, extremley gentle and leaves hair smooth and manageable. Recommended."
5.00,"Superior conditioner, which doesn't weigh my hair down, yet leaves it feeling so silky and touchable. Pantene really hit the jackpot with these wonderful products for older hair. In my heart, I feel age 16, but flip those numbers around and the reality is that I am 61 and my hair shows it! I have dyed my hair more times than I can count. I used to used hot rollers. I have even ironed my hair! EEK! If you have read this far, you know I know what I am talking about when I praise this product. I am only kicking myself that I didn't get the thickening adjunct to this set because I have fine hair. As a redhead, I have LESS hair than all of you people who are not redheads. Yes, it's true. We pay a steep price for our lusty red haircolor. I wouldn't change that. However, I AM realistic enough to realize that when a product is this good, and this reasonably priced, you should go for it! Pantene Pro-V Expert Collection Agedefy Conditioner delivers!"
4.00,"So glad I discovered this age-defying shampoo. I have come to rely on Pantene products to take the best care of my hair, and as I begin to age, and be concerned about using the right product, Pantene comes along and offers this rich formula that I can trust to make me look my best."
3.00,"It's a nice product, but I do think the price is too high.  It might work better for someone is super curly hair, but my frizzy hair didn't change much with this product.  The scent is nice and light and it works well, but again I didn't notice any difference from normal moisturizing shampoo."
3.00,"It's not anything special, it does it's job of cleaning the hair. I do feel as though my hair gets stripped of its natural oils when I use this shampoo. I'm trying to find a good sulfate free shampoo that won't be so harsh on my hair. For now this will do."
5.00,"One of my sons tried this at a friends house and loved it. He was using an all-in-one hair and body wash. but his thick wavy hair could get unruly and dry especially in the winter. This product helps to keep his hair more manageable and less dry. It's an ok price on Amazon, but I wish it could be ordered through subscribe and save, like some of the other Pantene products."
5.00,"This item was hard to find in stores. My husband has used this for years. This is the only shampoo he likes. I love the convenience of Subscribe and Save. The price is right and I won't run out and go to the store and hope it is in stock."
5.00,"It has kind of a floral/clean scent and it works amazing! I use this along with the conditioner and my hair feels softer and is less frizzy and dry then before!"
5.00,"I had used this product years ago until I couldn't find it. I tried Amazon.com and to my surprise I was able to purchase it. Now, I will continue to use it from now on. I rate this product 100%. Makes your hair soft and gives your hair a beautiful shine."
5.00,"I love this shampoo and conditioner. It makes my old hair soft again and I feel that their is actually more hair on my head. Also it is a great volumnizer (sp?). Don't use too much of the conditioner - it goes a long way."
5.00,"I have no complaints after ordering this product.great product in a size I've never seen before and love. Great price and wonderful delivery time.Thumbs up all around."
2.00,"My hair is fine once it dries, but when it's still wet it feels like I just spent the day in a pool. Also it makes my scalp extremely itchy, my shampoo is the only thing that has changed and it started the day I started using it. I suppose it's possible I'm just allergic to it, but I'm not allergic to anything else that I've found..."
5.00,"I received my sample of Pantene's Repair & Protect shampoo & conditioner. After my last perm and to much sun, my hair was beyond repair. I have tried every thing I could think of,spending money on products that did not add up to their products. After one use of your repair & Protect my hair felt and looked wonderful! It was soft and healthy looking and feeling. Thanks Pantene Tammy"
4.00,"I used this product and it has lasted a long time!!! A good shampoo. My only complaint is that the bottle top is very hard to open and close - you can't do it with one hand for sure."
4.00,"Being a senior citizen my gray hair is thinning. I like the coating provided by this product. My hair has become more manageable almost like it was so many years ago. Thank you, Pantene!"
5.00,"My hair was falling out BIG TIME because of slow thyroid, anyway, I got this shampoo because it's Pantene and I trust the brand. After only 2 uses I noticed a difference in hair loss and after a couple of weeks, my hair actually feels and looks thicker!"
1.00,"This isn't the product I was looking for but that is no ones fault. However I will not reorder"
5.00,"It did exactly what I hoped it would do - It certainly improved the condition of my hair. Could not find it locally."
5.00,"I love this shampoo! My hair has become thinner over the past few years. I'm allergic to all of the hair growing products on the market so I have struggled to find something to boost my self-confidence. Pairing this with the other products in the line leaves my hair full of volume and helps to camoflauge the trouble spots. Yes it is purely cosmetic but when you don't have the other options it's fantastic! I also love being able to order it in the larger size."
4.00,"You can't beat the price and it does what is suppose to do. I waited until there was an coupon to clip and ordered a pair. They are doing a good job and my hair looks great. Recommend."
5.00,"I washed my few hairs with this stuff and it was great. I wouldn't squirt it in your eyes though. My eyes rate this item very badly, but they are a little prejudiced."
1.00,"First of all this stinks, literally like nauseating overly sweet oil or olay (yuck). It did not make my hair thicker it made it thinner weighted down, flat, sad and worst of all??? It gave me very bad dry scalp/irritation/dandruff I had SCABS on my head I'm not sure if I'm allerigic to something in it or the fragence is irrating to the scalp but this is literally a hot mess. I'm done with pantene, they were great in the early 90's but since then nothing of theirs has even come close to their old scents and the body their shampoos USED to give me hair, it's a shame."
4.00,"Pantene hair products are generally expensive, but the additional cost is well-worth it. The shampoo continues to straighten my once-curly hair and it has a pleasant smell to it. I would recommend this brand and particular type of hair shampoo."
5.00,"My 6 year old wants to grow her hair long. We started using Beautiful Lengths and I have seen the results I was looking for. Her hair went from shoulder length to waist length in just over a year. This product leaves her hair with a pleasant smell and it's soft and silky! Very happy and satisfied!"
5.00,"Its okay because i hate 2 in 1 bottles. I love how it smells. It makes my hair like its dry and oily."
5.00,"I can not speak for personal use of this product as I am a bald middle aged man, but I can speak on behalf of my wife who used used just about every dandruff shampoo on the market. My wife's major compliant all the time is the medicine smell of other products. This product resolved that issue. This product smells great and is very much on par with the smell of Herbal Essence. I can attest to this fact. She also states that it leaves her hair feeling clean and silky without a lot of extra oils or moisture. Fantastic product."
5.00,"For years, I've been using this product. Then it suddenly disappeared from the market. I'm glad it's back. It took a while for my hair to get used to it again."
1.00,"The packaging is really awful. The lid of one of the bottles was open and the plastic wrapper was broken and the shampoo spilled all over inside of the box. The bottle is almost empty. The worst thing is there is a book shipped with it. The book had to be wiped and be wet."
5.00,"Great product, you don't have to apply shampoo and conditioner from different containers. Saves time and leaves your hair feeling great."
5.00,"I been looking for something like this cuz my hair is so thick and and its breaks easily and falls out very easily .,Love this product and would buy it again."
5.00,"This is a great product. It lathers richly and when working it into your hair it feels as if it keeps lathering as you work it in unlike other shampoos I have used that whimper out. It also has a nice smell that lingers beyond the shampooing. It leaves the hair feeling soft. I don't know how much \"volumizing\" it does.... I couldn't really tell (must be the thinning hair...beyond help :) ) All in all it is a great product that is worth considering using. Can't go wrong with Pantene products."
5.00,"i rate this product 100% because it really works excellent on my hair. i do recommend this for all the black women whose have problem finding ashampoo for your hair texture.the other shampoo i tried now has a variety of citric acid in it,and if your have fine hair it will surely make you lose your hair.it's really hard to find product now for our texture of hair i n stores today.and also,you get more percent of what you pay for in quanity. it's best to order from amazon online.they are true website and stand behind their word and the title of the company. i always order through Amazon!!!"
5.00,"I'm always trying new products, especially for my hair. The reason, I have serious scalp issues, dry, itchy, flaky, fine hair that is super thick. I've been, on doctor's orders, rotating dandraff shampoos for years. They are horrible, I never use a dryer even in winter because my hair always ends up straw like, I don't use much in the way of conditioners unless necessary and only ultra light ones because they always weigh my hair down and leave it limp and lifeless. I subscribe to a ton of subscription beauty boxes and I received a sample size of this shampoo and the conditioner in last seasons box from beauty tube. I figured I'd give it a try. It is AMAZING!!. I can use the shampoo and the conditioner, I don't have dry flaky scalp anymore, I don't have the heavy feeling on my hair, I do not have situation where no matter how much I rinse I still end up scraping up stuff off my scalp because the stuff just wouldn't come out of my hair best of all I can blow dry my hair completely dry and it is still nice and soft, no more straw and no more weigh down lifeless hair. Another thing I noticed, I usually shed a lot of hair, enough that I was brushing my hair 2-400 strokes a day just to get the loose hair completely out. My ends were also split. Not anymore. Every day, I notice less and less hair coming out and I'm down to just enough strokes to get the tangles and smooth out my hair. I have less split ends and my hair takes curls ( its normally very straight) very well. I put waves in by braiding when slightly damp, normally they brush out quickly but these stay in even after I wash my hair. So it has a slight wave to it now just from regular styling, I don't have to use any extra products save for a little hair spray now and then. So I've just bought a full sized of each product. I like the smell, the texture and the fact that I use 75% less of this product. I just don't need as much to get a good lather or to get the conditioned feel throughout my whole head. I'm looking forward to being able to throw out the tons of bottles of shampoo and conditioner I have ( I used to spend $50-60 even on things like Suave to have enough variety to switch out) and replacing it with this product. It is pricey at $16-$18 for both the shampoo and conditioner compared to other products but for me its an amazing savings."
5.00,"I love the 2-1 Shampoo and Conditioner. However, I do still use conditioner because of my hair type. I love pantene."
5.00,"Works great, especially paired with the Pro-V Fine Hair Solutions Moisture Renewal Conditioner. I decided to grow my hair out about 2 years ago, which for me takes FOREVER. This product has really helped the process in several ways.Using this product made me lose less hair when I brush. It makes my hair clean and well-moisturized without looking weighted down and greasy. In fact, my hair doesn't get greasy as quickly with this product compared with other shampoo/conditioner products. Obviously I wash my hair but it doesn't have to be everyday as long as I am using this exact line of Pantene. I live in the deser, and so humidity is not a concern I can offer any advice about.I tried a lot of products before deciding to go with Pantene. The other stuff did not seem prevent split ends or else it made my hair easily greasy or weighted down. With Pantene, I first tried the \"silicone-free aqua weightless\" line, because it was on sale and silicone-free sounded like a good idea. It was awful and I hated it and it made my hair seem like I hadn't used conditioner or a hairbrush. Between my shower and my commute it would turn into a rat's nest and it wasn't even very long back then.So to FIX the damage from that mistake, I decided to try this product, because it had all the right keywords for my hair (fine, renewal, moisturize); I figured I could yell at Pantene if all my hair fell out after using two of their products in succession. Instead, it fixed everything and made my hair great. My hair grew faster and now it's super long and I have no split ends.The only problem is that this product is hard to find in stores. Why, Pantene?This product helped me grow my hair super long, but now if I use anything else--and yes, in the last 2 years I have encountered lapses in availability of this product, during which I also tried Pantene Everlasting Ends--and the result is that my coworkers asked me if I was trying to dreadlock my hair, pointing out that bottoms-up is not the best way to do it. Yeah, that happened. So keep making this product, please. Nothing else seems to have the same effects."
1.00,"I tried this shampoo for about two weeks and found it to be awful. I switched from an expensive luxury brand because I am trying to grow my hair out and decided to give Pantene a try. I wash my hair everyday and by the second week it was getting a gross build up around the roots and didn't feel clean at all. I even tried the lather, rinse, repeat situation with no luck. Needless to say, I have gone back to my previous shampoo because this left my hair feeling gross and looking dull. Also, the scent is super strong and not pleasant to me. I wouldn't recommend this shampoo if you have fine hair."
2.00,"I like Pantene pro-v but i was not impressed with this 2 in 1.  I felt like after it my hair was so dry that I had to add more conditioner.  for me it would be better to just have a shampoo and a conditioner separately."
4.00,"I ordered this product about TWO WEEKS AGO and when it arrived (today) the product was LEAKING out of the bottle BEFORE I even opened the package it was in. The product is good to use, but if you DO order this product, be weary just in case if it ends up leaking BEFORE you even open it. Otherwise, it's a good product."
5.00,"This product and it's partners, conditioner and thickening lotion do what they promise. After two days of use I had more volume and less breakage of hair. After a month there is quite a difference. I highly recommend these products."
5.00,"I have been using this kit for three weeks, my hair is beautiful. My hair is fine, thick but thinning with age, shoulder length straight bob cut, it would look good after washing and styling, but a few hours later it would usually look dull, limp, slightly dry, fly away and sometimes had static. Agedefy, wow what a difference. When I first rinsed the shampoo off my hair felt thicker and slightly stiff, then I applied the conditioner, my straight fine hair felt very silky and thick. I blow dried it and my hair looked fantastic. I get the same results every time I wash my hair. I have not noticed any product build up, yet my hair always feels silky, thick, has body and the dry fly aways and the static are gone. I have stopped using styling products, occasionally before bed I use a small amount of Argan Oil 100% Pure 2 oz., rub a tiny amount on my hands and run this through my hair. I have always used high end hair and styling products and I have rarely achieved the same results as I have with the Agedefy Shampoo and Conditioner. Everyday I feel like I have just walked out of a salon. They are my new HG, beautiful hair without paying a high price."
5.00,"When my local store stopped carrying this style of Pantene, I was very happy to find that I could order it from Amazon. I tried other types of shampoo and my hair just did not do as well. Thanks, Amazon, for providing such a broad range of items."
5.00,"I tried samples of this shampoo and the matching conditioner. They are very nice, and I ordered them for times when I want to just jump in the shower and go fast. Usually I use Wen, but it takes some time when I use it. This other shampoo is for those other times occasionally when I'm short of time & just want to get it done as fast as possible."
1.00,"I have used Pantene Classic for the past, let's see, 15 years.They have changed their formula and now I cannot use it even once. My hair, previously thick and shiny became thin, dull and falling out. But this is not the worse part, my scalp felt burning, turned red and flakes of skin come out. It happened when I first used the new formula Pantene Classic (the one with the different smell for the long term users).                                              It also happened to the rest of my family members. Same scalp problems and hair loss.                                              Now I use Tresemme Naturals and so far, so good. I did try some natural and organic shampoos but did not work for different reasons. Too greasy, less clean, tangled..."
4.00,"Because of my super fine, color treated hair, I feel like I've tried about every \"fine hair\" product for volume. This Pantene shampoo is a great shampoo, but I can't entirely recommend it unless you use it with the Pantene Pro-V Fine Hair Solutions Flat to Volume Conditioner, 25.4-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 3), as it's intended. Using a conditioner on top of it not designed for fine hair, will simply counteract the benefits of \"not bogging down your hair\" this shampoo provides. I've also tried the Pantene all-in-one shampoo and hair conditioner, and I can categorically say for the best volume, feel and managability of fine hair - I would rate the separate shampoo and conditioners over the all-in-one. In fact, my ratings overall are: Pantene Conditioner= 5+ stars, this shampoo = 4-stars and the all-in one = about 3-4 stars."
4.00,"Sometimes I try something else but I always end up coming back. It's a good product and not over-priced. Love the pump on this, too."
5.00,"i really like the pantene 2 in1 for my kids. they like they smell and like how they only have to use it once cause it has both shampoo and conditioner in it"
1.00,"The product is great. I bought 2 bottles and both were opened up and half empty in the package!!! I paid for 2 bottles and only got enough shampoo to fill one!"
4.00,"I started going grey in my 20's so I've had long experience with that type of hair and the shampoos that do and don't work with it. I have thick hair, the kind that frizzes up whenever the air is either very humid or very dry. I found that this shampoo works well on my hair. The scent is strong right out of the bottle but doesn't remain strong on the hair.                           The liquid itself is a golden color, which sort of reminded me of a shiny version of wood glue; I thought it was a strange color choice for grey hair, which can occasionally get a yellowish tinge to begin with. If you wash your hair everyday, you can get away with one lathering, but if you go more than one day, it requires two applications to get your hair clean. It does rinse out cleanly, with no residue. I'd say that my hair is slightly softer after using it for a couple of weeks, not so wiry and slightly easier to manage. It played nice with the various after-shampoo hair products I use - no untoward interactions.                           I'd say that it's a good shampoo choice if you have the kind of grey hair that I do. It didn't make any dramatic difference with my hair, but it didn't dry it out or make it less manageable. The scent didn't annoy me, it lathered nice and rinsed cleanly; it left my hair feeling clean not stripped. I see that Amazon is listing the price as $19.99 as of the time I'm writing this; personally, I wouldn't pay that much for this shampoo or any shampoo for that matter."
5.00,"I find that this product helps keep my hair hydrated and soft. I will purchase this again in the future."
4.00,"It works well for brightening blonde hair and removing brassiness. I use it a few times a week and doesn't dry my hair out."
2.00,"this stuff doesn't work. my hair is left tangled, frizzy, unvolumized, and dry. it doesn't smell horrible, but it certainly is not the best. it has the effect of a sulfate-free lather but with unwanted sulfates, defeating the purpose. i had high hopes for this, so I was pretty disappointed."
5.00,"This is one of my favorite shampoos. This was a great deal for me and I have priced them. They last for a very long time."
5.00,"I quit coloring my hair over a year ago. Coloring my hair was expensive. Also, I hated the roots showing in between coloring. I am a swimmer and the first thing a hair dresser would comment on is the brassiness the pool water made my hair. Since using this shampoo I have no problem from pool water and my gray hair is nice and white. The shampoo is not drying (I use the Silver Expressions conditioner too) and I will continue to use it. I have been unable to find it in a store so Amazon keep selling this product!"
5.00,"Best dandruff shampoo but discontinued now! Clears the dandruff without drying the scalp too much (thereby causing more dandruff). Smells bad."
5.00,"Love that this product is on Subscribe & Save. It just comes in the mail and we never run out. This is the only shampoo/conditioner that my husband uses due to sensitive skin, so it's perfect for us. It's your basic 2 in 1 shampoo/conditioner, nothing fancy, but does the job."
5.00,"I'm not used to this variety of Pantene but when it came up at a discounted price I decided to give it a try. It works great and I've noticed no difference in hair-cleaning capabilities compared to other Pantene versions."
5.00,"My daughter and I have full heads of thick, wavy hair. We've spent hundreds on salon leave-in treatments etc... I bought this because it was on sale and we were both amazed at how great it works. It makes your hair noticeably silkier (to the eye and to the touch) and eliminates the need for any sort of frizz treatment or leave-in conditioner. It doesn't weight your hair down either. My daughter is a teenager and I have my hair high and low-lighted at the salon. We will keep using this product and throw out all others. It's that good."
5.00,"The first time I used this shampoo and conditioner my hair looked and felt good, but after the fourth time I used it my hair looked a felt the best it had in years! I have thick, straight-ish, light brown hair and it makes my hair soft without making it flyaway. I don't color or perm my hair so I don't know how well it works on treated hair. I use it in combination with Pantene Pro-V Expert Collection Agedefy Conditioner. I got this as a free trial, but I've already ordered more. PS - It always makes my day to know that people find these reviews helpful. If you'd also like to ask a question or leave a comment I usually respond the same day, so if you have a question or comment (even if it's just to say, Hi!\") feel free to post it below. Thanks, Claire"
5.00,"I have thin, fine, oily hair. It's been like that my whole life. If I don't wash it for a day it's slick with oil! It looks like I haven't washed my hair for a week. I've tried various shampoos. Home remedies, like dish soap and lemon. Nothing really worked that well. This shampoo is amazing! I was surprised with the results. MY hair has more body, and most importantly to me it is less oily! It doesn't look oily at the end of the day like my hair normally does. And it does give a body boost as well which is nice.I would recommend this to anyone with oily fine hair."
2.00,"Like all Pantene shampoos I have tried this is the same extremely drying and stripping. Leaves my hair straw like and begging for conditioner. Even though it claims to be different than regular Pantene for me it's the same."
5.00,"never know how to rate a basic essential such as shampoo. I never know how to rate a basic essential such as shampoo."
5.00,"I like to use a shampoo/conditioner together, so this works and the smell is pleasant. Can not find in the stores, so must order online---will always order the largest bottle so as not to have to reorder too often."
1.00,"The bottle was open and leaked inside the box. Lost half of the bottle. It was a messed inside the box. I was disappointed."
5.00,"I really like this clarifier. I use it once or twice a week to remove all the gunk off my hair from styling products, hairspray etc. It seems to re-energize and refresh my locks without stripping them out and making my hair overly dry. This makes my hair respond to my favorite shampoos again."
5.00,"Since it was discontinued in the stores the price was four times as much but the product does not make you hair greasy since I do not wash my hair everyday and the frizzies are gone. I tried Pantene's smooth which I thought was to take the place of this shampoo but my hair was greasy the next day. After trying about 8 different shampoos I finally gave in and paid the price for this shampoo."
4.00,"Smells good, leaves hair feeling soft and fuller than usual if you have thin hair. A friend, who has really thick hair, found it difficult to rinse it out, so it really is just for people who need to add fullness to their hair."
5.00,"i've used it for 2 weeks now and still got plenty left, its really good. and theres so much product for the price you pay"
5.00,"this smells great! and it gave my hair a nice clean smell and feeling.. i am definitely satisfied with my purchase"
5.00,"I have had long, baby fine hair for most of my life. And I have a lot of it. I have often wished for a shampoo such as this, it has done as it promised and the ends of my hair look better than they ever have. My hair, when I use this and the conditioner is so soft and shiny that even I have been amazed. This is by far the best shampoo I have ever used, I will not be changing to another brand as long as this product is available."
3.00,"Item: 2 in 1 Normal Shampoo/Conditioner Brand: Pantene Purchased In Store Quality: the quality of the product was okay compared to other 2 in 1 products, like Suave. Still, my hair didn't always feel clean. Instead, it felt like when you put in too much conditioner. Also, it didn't stay clean as long, instead of washing every other day, I had to wash each day and if I used too much by mistake I had to wash it twice. I had purchased this for someone else that I live with, but they refused to use anything but \"male\" titled brands so I ended up with it and I didn't want to waste it. Personally, I wouldn't buy this product again, which is saying something because I love Pantene. It was okay, but not great."
4.00,"I've used Pantene products for years now and I love them. I was excited to try this new product. It lathers nicely and rinses out cleanly (it doesn't feel like it leaves a residue behind in your hair). I have hair that is very fine and flat. I would say that this shampoo added a little bit of volume to my hair, but not enough to make me want to spend the price of what they are asking for this shampoo. I'll stick to the cheaper Pantene line and get almost the same results."
5.00,"This is the pantene that you all know and love. If you've never used it before then you should know it is the best hair cleaner I have ever used. Amazon's price is very good."
5.00,"Good shampoo - rinsed out well and left lots of shine. Had a really good scent. I would recommend it."
5.00,"Finally!! I found a shampoo that I love! My hair is usually very oily and I have to wash it everyday which sucks!! No more! This shampoo makes my hair feel so good. I love feeling it at night it is so soft I keep touching it and I have a lot of volume. Anyone knows with oily hair it is hard to get good volume because the oil weighs it down. I just love this shampoo. Thanks Pantene!"
5.00,"The classic Pantene is my favorite shampoo. I have dark brown wavy hair that I straighten or do big curls. My hair is always shiny and smooth. I get comments all the time. I also like it because I can use it everyday. I have tried others in the Pantene line (the shampoo and conditioner combo) and find this to be my fave."
5.00,"Love that smooth feeling you get when you wash your hair with this- don't even need a conditioner! I would highly recommend- especially with a coupon!"
5.00,"excellent product. my hair used to be breaking alot but since using this product it have shown a vast inprovement."
5.00,"This is one of the good Pantene shampoo I have used in last 5 years. The last one I had has issue with stickiness after washing my hair. I am an asian man and have thick but manageable black hair. This shampoo really gives a good feeling about your hair being cleaned and have no sticky feeling which I observed in previous Pantene products."
3.00,"I used this product for two weeks and there was a noticeable improvement with dryness and shine. It worked better when combined with their hair thickening treatment. Overall I didn't think it adressed all the problems that it claims to nor was it any better or worse than the other Pantene products I've used in the past. Another good product from Pantene but not worth the extra hype of a special \"Agedefy\" label."
5.00,"I am an Amazon.com Vine Program reviewer and am offered two books or products twice a month in exchange for an honest review. This month I saw some products that my wife might benefit from. She asked me to order this one for her. I did so with the promise that she would write the review. This is her review:\"I suffer from what I call \"Thyroid Hair\" which means that I have thin, fine, dry, flat hair. I was fortunate to get the Patene Expert Collection Age Defy Shampoo from Vine. It has now been 10 days of daily shampoos and I can honestly say that my hair is less dry, smoother, and fuller than in the past.The shampoo is thick, rich and has a subtle fragrance which lathers into an emollient rich expensive salon type shampoo and it cost about $8 for 30 ml. This is a great buy. In fact I have decreased the amount that I use since it produces so much lather. My hair get much drier in the winter months and I am a daily user of the blow dryer and curling iron, but this product has left my hair less dry or brittle looking, fuller and more shiny than it has ever been. The results are visible not only to me but to family and coworkers who have noticed the difference from flat to full and dull to shiny. I am so pleased that I will also be purchasing the conditioner that is recommended. Thanks Pantene.\"I can tell you first hand that my wife's hair looks so much nicer and really smells even better since she started using this product.Although this product was free in exchange for this honest review, we will reorder it when this one gets low.Enjoy!"
5.00,"After thyroid cancer surgery and radiation my hair became brittle and a lot fell out. Bought the shampoo & conditioner which noticeably helped!"
5.00,"I have been \"fighting\" with my hair for ages now, and as I get older I find that hair products can contribute significantly to this battle. I either get knocked out of the ring right at the first bell, or I manage to keep my hair in control for half a day, or something happens and I end up looking like Don King. Enough boxing similies. Let's get to the point. Pantene Pro-V Expert Collection Agedefy Shampoo \"understands\" me. It keeps my hair looking silky and younger, I adore this product! I feel so much prettier! Feeling pretty and good about yourself should be a part of why you do the things you do when you \"perform your ablutions\" (as I like to say when I am kidding around with my husband)! Thanks, Pantene, you're the champ!"
5.00,"Excellent! Love it works great! I bought it for my daughter and her hair looks great and started using it for my oily hair and is fabulous! !"
2.00,"This cream style shampoo really weighs my hair down. I have baby fine hair and tons of it. This product makes my hair feel very heavy. I really don't care for the texture or creaminess of this shampoo. I don't like it."
5.00,"This keeps my hair the colour blond I want it to be. A friend told me about it and am I ever glad. The condition is very good to."
4.00,"I have to be completely honest. I really don't see a whole lot of difference between one shampoo and the next. I've never found even one that didn't seem to clean my hair, which should be the entire point. I mean, there's a definite difference between the various styling products and I'm a lot more selective in that area, but with shampoo, as long as the scent isn't crazy bad, color me happy. How's that for being a discriminating user? So this Pantene gets my hair clean, smells reasonably good, and is relatively inexpensive. The scent is nice, but it's just slightly feminine for my taste. Not so foo foo that I wouldn't use it, but it's not an especially manly scent either. Still, no one will question your masculinity if you have this in your shower, so don't let my comment keep you from trying this product. My hair is not curly, so perhaps it has some sort of magical power over curly hair. I just don't know, because again, my hair is straight. So to recap: Cheap shampoo that gets your hair clean and smells at least reasonably good. I suppose that warrants 4 stars, don't you think?"
5.00,"Product is good it does what it states"
5.00,"I wrote a review for the conditioner. I ordered this for my Mom who is 63 and starting to go gray. The shampoo and conditioner make her hair silky and shiny. She has tried some other brands but I told her how much I love the Pantene Highlighting Expressions for blondes and she agreed to try it. She loves this stuff. I can't find it at a brick and mortar store, so this is now on my wish list for when Mom needs more."
1.00,"I bought this with the conditioner (which by the way I love) and my hair dried out to the point that while I was gently brushing it it all snapped off and broke. Hate the shampoo, love the conditioner."
5.00,"I'm embarassed to admit how much effort and expense I've put into finding the \"perfect\" shampoo over the years. I have thick, coarse, naturally wavy hair that is very difficult to keep under control, even in low humidity. Additionally, my scalp is very sensitive to many shampoo ingredients, causing my scalp to itch uncontrollably, and resulting in heavy dandruff. I've tried so many shampoos - Everything from Suave to Kerastase. I really liked the Kerastase shampoo I used for about a year (Bain Satin 2), but I began noticing that my hair was falling out at an alarming rate. After every unsuccessful attempt at switching shampoos, I always wind up right back at Pantene Daily Moisture Renewal. This shampoo is VERY gentle on my scalp, never irritating in the least. The fragrance is really nice (although I liked the previous generation of this shampoo's fragrance even more). It makes my hair very strong and healthy, and I rarely see more than one or two fallen strands in the bathroom sink after drying/styling. It's also great at keeping my crazy hair under control. I'm generally not a huge fan of P&G's environmental/animal rights positions, but I do understand they are moving in the right direction (finally) with respect to these issues. The bottom line is this is always the shampoo I find myself going back to - I love what it does for my hair."
5.00,"This shampoo is a great deal and smells amazing! I will definitely buy again. I can't say that it works as well as my Joico shampoo used to, but for less then 1/3 the price I am ok with that!"
5.00,"my hair was always silky soft... until I got these crazy white kinky hairs with a mind of their own. I tried all sorts of products, in all sorts of price ranges and none has made my hair feel more like it used to than this product. People have noticed. They have commented that my hair looks great and I am so pleased. I just wish the larger bottles were more readily available."
5.00,"I have long, thick and wavy salt-and-pepper hair that often looks fly-away and a little frizzy. This shampoo does seem to make a noticeable difference. My hair is softer and easier to manage right after a shampoo, when it's usually wildest. I'm using the same Pantene Ice Shine conditioner I was using with my earlier shampoo (Pantene Ice Shine)."
5.00,"I absolutely love this shampoo. It gave my hair a great balance of smoothness and shine! I used it with the Daily Moisture Renewal Conditioner and together it does wonders!"
4.00,"I can't blame the product so I'm giving the shampoo the average score it currently has, four stars, making my review a wash. Which is kind of ironic."
3.00,"I have been using Head & Shoulder for a long time but I have heard good reviews for Pantene. I bought it. Its good conditioner but it is not as good as Head & Shoulder for dandruff. Save money and buy H&S instad. I know I would be."
5.00,"This product works wonders on curly hair! so happy i tried it out."
5.00,"I've been using this product for awhile but could no longer find it in the stores. My hair color has lots of grey in it and as a senior, I have hair loss. This product enhances my natural Brunette, and the grey doesn't seem as overwhelming. It is also less harmful than coloring my hair with harsh hair color products. Therefore, it is just what I wanted."
5.00,"The BEST shampoo for the money.....period !! All these other idiots with 1, 2 & 3 stars don't even know their own hair....or....they're trying to get something FREE from Pantene !!! Weightless body & shine with no breakage for medium to thick hair.....just like it says!!!!!!!! Thank you Pantene...... BEST SHAMPOO ON THE MARKET FOR YEARS !!!!!!!"
5.00,"I think it was very good but the problem was it was only smooth for one day but I don't care because I wacth my hair after every two days and this shampoo smells amazing!!!!!!!!!!"
5.00,"I've used Pantene Pro-V Brunette for a long time. It leaves hair soft [if used with Pantene Conditioner] and with a nice shine. My hair is high maintenance, think coarse and curly. So any product that cuts down on 'hair time' is most welcomed in my shower."
3.00,"Sometimes you find a hair product that causes the clouds to part and angels start singing. This isn't it, for me. However, it does smell wonderful -- like apples. It did knock down the frizz some, but not completely. I could feel a difference -- the coating it puts on my hair makes it feel softer and less dry. This seems to help some in the very dry climate in which I live. My loose curls lasted longer before they turned into frizz. After a few days, I went out and bought the same flavor conditioner. I think that magnified the effect of the shampoo. Update: I ran out of this a few days ago. I purchased the dry to moisturized for thin hair. It didn't have nearly the same effect as the Medium-Thick formula. I might actually go out and buy some of this stuff. Disclaimer: I use minimal amounts of product."
5.00,"I heard pantene is the Healthest for your hair by a Doctor.this shampoo makes my hair feel so clean.plus makes it shine and it smells good."
5.00,"I've used several Pantene products. With every of their products I've tried I noticed improvement in my hair, texture, manageability. Not so much with this one. Not much difference in volume and it seemed to leave my hair feeling as if there was something left that should have been rinsed out."
5.00,"I like the Ice Shine 2 in 1, my first time buying it. It smells lovely and makes my hair very shiny. I had to adjust to using it but after a week it was amazing. I recommend this product works well, smells good, and is a light scent not too strong. Another plus guys or gals can use it."
3.00,"I bought this silver shampoo because I wanted something to tone my hair and help it stay healthy. I am not yet quite 25% grey and my hair can be brittle and dry- and is not in the best condition after two babies took their toll on it. I found that it did help the color quite a bit and it is slightly less frizzy. However the shampoo is so dry that it's hard to use on the ends of my hair and I have to be really careful not to pull on my hair as I am working out through in the shower. The conditioner works well to remedy that and I like the conditioner. I don't know if it has to strip more of the oils to impart the color correction, but I will probably try another silver shampoo to see if I can find one that is more moisturizing."
4.00,"Very sweet smelling shampoo :) love it. I've washed my hair with it only 2 times so far, and my hair is smoother and definitely softer. Happy I purchased it"
5.00,"Don't listen to the one star review, Ice Shine shampoo is super, but the conditioner (not the 2 in 1) is an even better product and I highly recommend them both. Leaves hair Super shiny and soft. Not for oily or dry hair types, but if normal hair, it can't be beat."
5.00,"I 've been using this shampoo for about 4 months now and prior to that I would have trouble growing my hair. I am really happy with the results"
1.00,"I purchased the matching age defy shampoo & conditioner thinking I'd like it because the bottle claimed it had anti aging properties. HUGE MISTAKE! I bought the pump bottles which were fifteen bucks a piece, I have never kicked myself so hard for wasting my money on a product that smells SO horrendous that I had to wash my hair over with my regular shampoo JUST to get the smell out of my hair from this one!! The smell makes me gag it is so bad! The worst part is, when I took the bottles back to the store to attempt to get my money back, I was refused a refund because it was \"used\". I \"used\" it ONCE they could clearly see that. I ended up tossing thirty bucks worth of shampoo into the trash can right as I exited the store! I thought perhaps this product would be different than the rest of the Pantene shampoo and conditioners because last time I purchased a Pantene shampoo, I could tell the smell changed. All of the regular shampoos have a very noticeable chemical smell to me. This age defy line proved to be even worse! Needless to say, I will NEVER buy Pantene products again!"
5.00,"I chose this product from Amazon Vine because I have always liked and trusted Pantene products, and my hair was driving me crazy! I'm in my late 40's and have very dark brown, almost black hair, and have been getting stray gray hairs for years; my hair has always been very shiny though, so the odd silver gets lost in the black and I haven't had to resort to the hassle and expense of coloring my hair - yet. I was beginning to think I would have to, though, because in the last six months or so the texture of my hair has changed, becoming duller, dryer, more flyaway. My stylist rolls his eyes at my Pantene and says I have to use better shampoo, and he has sold me a couple of European shampoos, twice the price of this product, for fine hair and dry hair. They are very nice and help somewhat but don't address the texture issue, so I was eager to try this product from good old Pantene - at half the price! Well, I've been using it for over a week, daily shampooing, and I can't believe the difference in my hair - it feels thicker, the shine is back, no more dry, brittle texture or flyaways - wow! And an added bonus, I really love the smell and texture of the product, thick and golden and pearlescent and smells like cocoa butter, lovely and luxurious - although I must admit, I was so frustrated with the condition of my hair I would've been happy to get these results if it had the texture and smell of peanut butter (although I LOVE peanut butter)... VERY highly recommended to middle-aged people like myself who are facing the inevitable signs of aging hair (coarse texture, dryness, flyaways, unruly grays, etc.), and the label says this product is safe for for daily use on color-treated hair."
2.00,"I really dislike this shampoo as, I find it leaves a greasy residue in my hair. I wash 3 or 4 times and my hair still feels heavy and dirty. It's a shame because I love the conditioner and will continue to use that but, no-go for this shampoo."
5.00,"I have been looking for Pantene silver expressions for a long time. Not sold in any stores near me so I was very happy to find it online. I love how it keeps my hair soft and keeps the silver color true. Other shampoos dull the gray/silver color and make it all washed out."
5.00,"This shampoo is excellent! It is very gentle, but lathers very well at the same time. The scent is nice and light, not overwhelming at all. It did not dry out my hair or scalp, and left my hair shiny and healthy-looking. I purchased it here on Amazon, and it was quite economical. It came in a very generous 25.4 oz bottle for a pack of 2...a great deal for the price and also the quality. I highly recommend this product, and will definitely repurchase."
5.00,"I have mostly silver/grey hair that unless I use a \"gray\" shampoo, tends to become brassy and dull! This shampoo cleans my hair and gives it a great shine. I haven't been able to find it in any retail stores locally so thank you Amazon!"
5.00,"Great shampoo and large size bottles. Helps dry hair regain strength and look nice and shiny also! Def buy this product"
3.00,"I love Pantene products, but this one is overpriced. You can go to Costco and get Pantene shampoo for $2 - $4 less depending on whether there is a coupon available."
5.00,"I love the Pantene 2 in 1 products. This one is best for me, but all work well. Good to be able to order ahead. Loved Amazon quick delivery."
5.00,"I have been using pert-plus and head-n-shoulders for years.. first time I tried Pantene on regular basis and I love it."
4.00,"I have long hair and I like Pantene products. I don't really pay that much attention to which products I use but I thought that I would give this one a try when the opportunity presented itself. I am definitely satisfied with the results but I don't know if I will have any strong desire to go out of my way to purchase this shampoo again. This shampoo works fine. My hair isn't particularly frizzy by nature though I occasionally have issues because I am a water polo player. This shampoo seems to prevent problems though I am not sure if this was even a problem to begin with at this time. I recommend giving this shampoo a try if you have problems with frizziness. It's definitely worth a shot and you may see some results. I think I did."
1.00,"I did not realize this was a shampoo and conditioner. Probably would not have bought it had I realized it had conditioning in it. Conditioner makes my hair too soft and unmanageable."
4.00,"I used this for a week+ with no other hair products, to see if I really felt it did anything for \"unruly grey hair\" as I have a head full of that. It did fine, I felt that my hair was \"smoother\". I have some natural curl that thankfully this product did NOT deaden that down as some products seem to leave more on your hair than others do and I did not feel this way about this shampoo. It has a great scent too, so many shampoos are overly flowery and not in a good way. I've used Pantene products for years and felt this was in keeping with the typical quality of their products."
5.00,"wanted something for everyday that won't dry my hair or leave it too heavy. this 2-in-1 isn't either one. would recommend for every day use but use something nicer on the w/e or when you have more time to shampoo and condition well separately"
5.00,"I have used various Pantene products for years so it wasn't hard for me to turn to them for the latest hair emergency in my life. My hair is perfect in the summer - happy, shiny and bouncy. But the last couple of years it has lost it's happiness as soon as summer was over and started to be brittle, dry and static filled. I tried various moisture shampoos with no lasting success, tried conditioning until my hair was lifeless. Nothing helped for more than 1 or 2 treatments. When I saw the Pantene for aging hair it suddenly struck me that THAT was the problem - my hair was getting older too. The first couple of times I tried the shampoo I really didn't see much change. Then I added the conditioner and still not much but now after using them both for 2 weeks I can tell you that it IS working. I have lots less static in my hair, it looks shiny again and feels moisturized. I don't know if it will be a permanent fix but I'm hoping and happy that Pantene figures out my hair solutions before I do!"
4.00,"This is a very generous bottle of shampoo, so I think for the price, it's a bargain. I can't, however, say I see any real difference in my hair's volume. The shampoo cleans well, and leaves my hair manageable, so it's not a disappointment as a shampoo. For me, anyway, it just doesn't live up to the promise of adding volume. I've seen the TV commercials, and that's the main focus of the message: increased volume. (That's what prompted me to order it.) Does that mean the Pro-V doesn't deserve a four-star rating? Perhaps. I just considered that maybe on some types of hair, the product would add volume. Maybe my fine, fair hair is beyond help. (At least from a shampoo. For the moment, I'll continue to rely on mousses, gels, and sprays.)"
5.00,"Out of the many shampoos I have tried to keep my blonde hair from getting dull or darker this has been the best. You can't go wrong with this if you have blonde hair just as you can't go wrong with any Pantene product."
5.00,"This shampoo works awesome for gray or graying hair. What a difference! I use the conditioner by Pantene also - and they work great together."
4.00,"The bottle says this shampoo is a \"lightweight system [that] boosts hair for all day volume*\" and when you read the print on the back it means when using their \"*shampoo, conditioner, and root lift spray gel.\" Despite having only the shampoo, I found it left my hair squeaky clean and moderately bouncy with a very mild fresh scent. This product is equivalent to many of the other volumizing shampoos on the market that I already tried. However, the best volumizing shampoo for my hair still is Sunsilk Volumizing Shampoo for fine hair that comes in the yellow bottle (not yet availble on Amazon)."
2.00,"I thought I was getting 2 bottles of shampoo-not! This product is way overpriced for only one bottle! I returned and was charged for return shipping! Someone needs to change the picture of product! BTW-I love this shampoo!!"
1.00,"First thing I noticed was that this is hard to rinse out. It's as if your hair is not clean. I also used this with the matching shampoo and I had the most awful looking hair within 15 minutes of stepping out of my shower. If you want your hair to feel thin, limp, lifeless, dry and dirty.....then these are for you. If you don't really want to look like you are an unkempt slob, pick again."
5.00,"This shampoo helped fixed my damage hair leaving it clean and lustrous. My hair smell delicious. Thank you."
5.00,"My favorite shampoo, no longer available. After hunting in a few stores I checked Amazon and learned that it was no longer being offered. Thankfully I was able to order two bottles of the rapidly disappearing stock. At the rate my hair is thinning, this may turn out to be a lifetime supply!"
1.00,"I jumped on this product because it sounded like it was just for me:  Made for fine hair.  I started using it and liked it's smell, but I didn't notice it did anything to make my fine hair look fuller.  Eventually, I noticed that my hair was looking greasy and hung in clumps.  Even pulled back in a ponytail, my hair strands were separating.  Was my chemistry changing or was it the shampoo? I changed to another shampoo and my hair is back to normal--soft and fine, but clean-looking, too."
5.00,"I have thin fine hair that tangles easily, this is the miracle product for me, this is truly weightless and very nice"
4.00,"The Pantene Fine Hair Shampoo has a nice sleek bottle and the same pleasing aroma of other Pantene products. Its claim is to be a \"lightweight system that boosts hair for all day volume.\" It definitely has a volumizing effect. The shampoo works up into a great foamy lather and leaves the hair feeling completely clean. While it was very effective at stripping away old product build up, the volumizing properties were a bit aggressive. People with very fine hair may find that it is too abrasive and should definitely pair the shampoo with an effective conditioner to protect the sheen and health of their hair."
5.00,"Works well. Lathers fast and long."
5.00,"Love this product! Co-worker w very long beautiful hair recommended it highly & I have been using several months now. Am going to be letting her know how much I appreciate her telling me about it. I also use organic tamanu oil from an amazon seller for my face & skin & hair..."
5.00,"My hair has always been naturally kinky and dry, however with the use of Pantene Pro-V Relaxed & Natural my hair has been transformed. I never have to comb out a lot of kinks in hair, like I use to with other shampoo. It keeps my hair soft, fluffy, hydrated, shiny and clean. I also don't have to worry about it tangling as much as I used too. When I can't go to a salon and get my hair relaxed this is a great substitute. (I'm a college student, so I can't afford to spend too much time or money on my hair.) If you're looking for a shampoo for \"black hair\" this is the shampoo. It makes hair care effortless. (I use it with Carol's Daughter which helps too) I hope that if you choose this product that it works for you too!"
5.00,"This product enhances my natural Brunette color so the grey in my hair doesn't seem as noticable. I like that it doesn't have the harsh chemicals that hair coloring products have. It works just enough for me."
5.00,"If you have thin hair do not use too much conditioner. I have seen less break away hair. Kudos."
3.00,"As someone whose hair is showing the effects of aging, I was drawn to this product's description. It certainly sounded like a dream. However, like many dreams it failed to live up to reality. Overall, this is a nice shampoo for normal to slightly dry hair. However, it doesn't perform miracles, and I didn't notice a difference between this and other Pantene shampoos I have used over the years. My hair did look very shiny after I used it but again, I have achieved the same effect with other Pantene shampoos. This was good but nothing special."
5.00,"This is, hands down, the best shampoo on the market right now! It has everything I look for in a shampoo. It's gentle, has a light pleasant fragrance, and a clear consistency. It's also Paraben-free and contains aloe vera which is so beneficial to hair and scalp. Creamy shampoos often weigh my hair down which is why I switched to this shampoo. I was afraid it would be too drying since most clear shampoos are but to my surprise, it left my hair looking and feeling healthy and youthful. Hair hasn't felt this full in a long time. I've tried over 40 shampoos (from salon ones to sulfate-free ones) and none compare to this product. The product is infused with Panthenol which does thicken hair over time and this is Pantene's gentlest shampoo in terms of formula/ingredients. I get consistently good results with this shampoo and have no plans to switch shampoos. Thank you, Pantene, for producing such a terrific product. A real joy to use."
3.00,"There are better products manufactures by this company. The quantity is to large for a single person use. I do not like this."
5.00,"This shampoo also works well on thick, coarse hair that is made worse by lap swimming. It smoothes out my hair without the need for follow-on products. This is a plus for a guy that just wants to wash and go. This shampoo has a mild and pleasant scent, and it does not leave any filmy residue. It does all of this at a value price."
5.00,"I just impulse bought the trial kit for this line of products and have used them twice on my mid-back length, fine hair. Every time I turn around someone is telling me how great my hair looks. I can't keep my hands off of it because it feels so great. Highly recommend, I am so glad I stumbled upon this."
4.00,"This is a heavy box with the two bottles. Well packaged, it arrived on time with no damage. Pantene is nice shampoo and this particular item in their line was liked by all in our family."
5.00,"my family uses a lot of shampoo and they only like a few brands one being pantene so this was a great price and nice big bottles."
5.00,"Hope that they dont take it off the market again. Just love it. Great for gray hair. Also love the conditioner."
1.00,"If your like me, I read the single star stuff first and think the 5 star stuff is manipulated sometimes. So I'm getting your attention here because this shampoo is great! I really didn't care whether it worked or not, just need shampoo and thought \"whatever\". I'm shocked. There is 1/4 the amount of the hair in my drain after a shower - after only 1 use. Yes. One use! My hair would coat my bathroom floor, this shampoo has cut that down more than half. I am so happy and didn't even know I cared!"
1.00,"Truly disappointed! After using for 2-3 days, I first thought I wasn't rinsing the conditioner well enough. That was not the problem. Then I ONLY applied conditioner on my hair from the base of my skull downward, and not on my scalp. That was not the problem. The problem was the shampoo-it left a great deal of residue and made my hair look and feel greasy. My husband said it looked like I hadn't washed my hair for a week. This product is going back! Pantene has moved away from their slogan For hair so healthy it shines (which is what drew me to, and kept me with Pantene - not to mention singing the praises of Pantene to everyone who complimented me on my shiny healthy hair!)"
4.00,"P&G Pantene, you changed your formula for the Blonde Expressions Hightlights and I am not happy. It no longer deposits blonde color. I have dark hair and loved the Blonde Expressions for Highlights. It kept my highlights blonde which is what I wanted. This doesn't mean I won't use Pantene hair products because I love Pantene and have used your products for over twelve years. Give your customer the choice to have the blonde color deposited on the hair or not have the blonde color."
5.00,"I have thick hair and it is hard for me to find hair care products that don't make my hair feel \"heavy\" and weighed down. I love this shampoo because it is so light and rinses completely . . . it leaves my hair feeling light and clean, just what I want my shampoo to do!"
5.00,"I like this product a lot. I have very long mostly gray hair, and I like the scent, and my hair feels squeaky clean after use!"
2.00,"In the past I have used several Pantene products and was always satisfied with the results. That may be why I was so surprised at the difference in ths product. I had to use much more just get a lather. It never made my hair look or behave as Pantene products usually do. Also, it never had that clean, just-washed feel. That it what I get for choosing a lower priced product. From now on, I will stick with higher quality. Pantene must still have a few of them. I hope so."
5.00,"It really works as advertised. The shampoo gives volume and the conditioner softens. My hair feels so good!"
1.00,"It made my hair limp and without any body. I would never buy it again! If your hair is fine, don't use this product!"
4.00,"These shampoo has potential. I have thin, fine long hair that seems to have short gray hairs that like to stick out on my part (drives me crazy). I've only used this once, but I think it would be even better if I had used it with its conditioner. My hair felt good after washing with this. This impressed me because Pantene products normally don't work great with my hair. So I am thinking this is a really good product."
3.00,"A fine product. The only one that I really like. Sadly, they dont produce it anymore. The one I receive end of october was having an expiration date of october. Not fair from the vendor...."
5.00,"This is a very creamy shampoo. With all artificial/mainstream ingredients. I usually prefer the more natural product lines because I'm not a fan of chemicals, but I have enjoyed this shampoo. It gives my hair a nice hang and a nice amount of body. Not too much volume, but enough to make it bouncy. It is very heavily scented, I could use a little less perfume, but I've gotten used to it after a few days. For a mainstream shampoo, I do recommend this brand. And specifically this age defying shampoo."
4.00,"The conditioner seems to leave my hair a little oily. The Advanced Thickener does give it more body that holds the styling longer."
5.00,"I loved this product when it was on the market a couple of years ago. I wrote to the company complaining when they took it off the market. It makes my grey hair nice and soft and shiny. I like that I can buy it in these packets for travel purposes. And I bought it on Amazon in the bottle sizes for my shower. I also use it on my wire haired terrier for a softer coat. Terrific!"
3.00,"Gave me so much dandruffs after continuous use, would not recommend. You kight want to try pantene color preserve volume instead."
3.00,"I ordered Pantene shampoo and received the Pantene shampoo & conditioner 2 in 1. This is not what I wanted. I now have an added expense because I also bought the Pantene conditioner. I don`t have only one of the 2 in 1 I have six as that was what I ordered in the shampoo. I do not want to go to the time and expense to return it so I am hoping I like it because I will be using it for a very long time."
4.00,"My mother likes this particular Pantene product line, but didn't like the prices in the local stores. Bought the big bottle on Amazon for a reasonable price and I think it will last her all year..."
5.00,"This shampoo has a nice scent. Its not overpowering at all. I like how it cleans my hair and its very soft and manageable. Feels very light and has alot of body after I blow dry after the wash. This shampoo is a keeper!"
4.00,"I like it. It's not as expensive as salon shampoo,but gives me the same outcome. It's arrived quickly and in new condition."
5.00,"My hair breaks very easily, and I use this shampoo because its the only thing that I found that helps it not too. I love i!"
5.00,"I love Pantene. I've been using it for years. The price isn't bad as I only need a little. I'm not sure the volume does anything, but it's worth a shot to me since the price is usually the same as the regular."
4.00,"I've used Pantene for a while and although this is supposed to be a re-formulated version, I really could not tell much of a difference. I liked the smell and my hair felt clean as usual, but other than the nifty new bottle, it was the same experience. I'm giving it 4 stars since the shampoo does what it promises to do and works well just like the old version."
5.00,"Love this shampoo. It actually gives my long, flat, straight hair a little volume. I hate using cream based shampoo and this one is clear and light. I love it."
3.00,"I have been using this product and the serum for about a month. At the beginning I raved about it but now I have developed a dermatitis and it seems it's from the drying effect. I don't know if it is the serum or the shampoo though because I don't use one without the other. The rash is all along my hairline and I will need to discontinue. Bummed because it did show results but you do need to use a conditioner with it."
5.00,"I have oily hair and need to wash my hair every day. Some shampoos just aren't strong enough to make my hair feel clean, while others, even Pantene brand, leave a strange residue on my hair that makes it feel dirty even when I first get out of the shower. This works well for me and love how Amazon offers subscribe & save for it."
5.00,"I love Pantene shampoo so I was very happy to find this big bottle, and the pump is a blessing! It measures out just the right amount of shampoo. No fumbling with slippery bottles; no over pouring so there's no waste. Love it!!"
3.00,"I think this is a fake! When I received the package, I noticed that it did not look anything like the real thing! It has the name in English, French, and I believe in Spanish. In the REAL product at the store, it only has it in English. It also has a different smell. Overall, I would still continue to order this product because it works, my hair is usually very frizzy and after I started using this it has made it less frizzy, and a lot more softer. Only thing that bugs me is that they would sell it as the real thing but in reality it isn't."
1.00,"Purchased this due to good reviews on this page. Just like the below customer, it really dried out my hair. When I lathered it, it tangles my hair. This shampoo is also in gel so I would recommend going for creamy if you have dry hair.What to do with this shampoo? I'm not too sure :("
5.00,"Has a wonderful fragrance in a big bottle. Bought the conditioner to complement the shampoo. I've always liked Pantene products, but lately their prices have been too high. Thanks to Amazon, we now have two of these jugs in our shower!"
3.00,"It's okay. Price was great; smells good. What else can you say about shampoo? It arrived swiftly. This requires too many words for so little a product."
5.00,"I love the smell, it cleans well, and this is a really big bottle for the price. My hair is actually improving from a harsh permanent since using this shampoo"
5.00,"Makes my hair super soft and manageable. Great quality and quantity and price! :) Totally love it! I am gonna keep using it. Hopefully they don't change the formula."
2.00,"My hair did look repaired and better and thicker but it lost softness and felt a little stiff and heavy. Felt very harsh in the shower. I may try the repair and protect in the regular shampoo/conditioner( not 2 in 1) and see what happens."
5.00,"I've been searching for a shampoo that works well for oily hair, and this is it! I can finally skip a day if I need to and actually wear my hair down and feel clean. I have long thick healthy hair, so I wouldn't have though to choose this particular shampoo, but I read that Pantene recommends this for oily hair and they were right!"
4.00,"I purchased this product after coloring my hair. I have long thick black hair that I attempted to color blonde. Turned out a beautiful brownish red. Anyways my scalp n hair is dry n I didn't want hair to fall out. A close friend told me to deep condition. So I came across this in Walgreens. Thought it would be good to prevent damage.I washed and conditioned under the dryer for 15 min. First thing I noticed while combing in conditioner was no shedding. I could not believe not a single strand came out. I always shed. No shedding after rinse out. Ends look beautiful. Also tried split end diffuser. Diffuser seemed to dry out hair. Shampoo n conditioned r great."
3.00,"nothing special, for my hair I still need an instant conditioner it doesn't feel like there's a conditioner in it at all"
5.00,"My hair is fine but I have a lot of it, and a lot of shampoos can weigh my hair down. This one doesn't do that so much, so my hair looks better on day 2."
5.00,"In the past I had used expensive salon shampoos for my hair, hoping to achieve volume.  Some have worked some haven't, the commonality of them all were they were pricey.  I tried Pantene Flat to Volume, thinking that it might give me a little volume but truthfully I had low expectations.  Well, not anymore.  This shampoo is really good.  I have body and bounce and this is not an overly priced product.  It works well into a lather with only a little dollop.  Rinses easily too.  I cannot imagine switching back to salon shampoos because Pantene is so much better."
1.00,"this is not for all types of hair check before ordering because u may end ip with re3ally flat hair. so be causious when placi"
4.00,"This shampoo has a nice scent and cleans my hair really well. It also has a lower rating on the Environmental Working Group's scale, which means it has fewer harmful chemicals in it than most conventional shampoos."
5.00,"I love the feel of this shampoo on my hair. My hair and scalp feels clean and fresh. it makes it so soft and provides the moister I need. I love using this product."
5.00,"Love the way this shampoo is gentle and yet cleanses so well, leaving your hair feeling great! I use this in conjunction with Pantene's Age Defying Conditioner. With mostly salt and pepper hair (silver), this works well. I would highly recommend this product and seller!"
5.00,"I have used it daily to weekly and always had great results!"
5.00,"I have very fine hair and all of the voumizing shampoos and conditioners I've tried left my hair sticky and heavy. This doesn't, I love this shampoo!"
4.00,"I have thinning hair as I am getting older. I love the body and volume this shampoo gives me. The big container is huge and some of it leaked out in shipping. I think the shear weight of the container caused this and not poor packing."
2.00,"I was disappointed in the feel of this shampoo in my hair. It felt heavy, did not mix with water well and made my hair feel oily after 2 washes, yet dry at the same time. Why did you change it, Pantene? The previous product was MUCH better."
5.00,"So I used this product awhile ago but forgot about it when I started buying new shampoo's all over. I found this product again under my sink and I used it to wash out my yogurt and olive oil hair mask and it helped so much!                                                                     This product is great for soft,less frizy and poofy hair! I have thick wavy-straight hair and it works wonders on my split ends ! I hope they re-manufacture this some time soon :)"
4.00,"This is my shampoo of choice - it keeps my hair, which is very thick and prone to becoming curly, soft without weighing it down. My only complaint is that the corresponding conditioner ( http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0094H5QE0/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_3 ) seems to be harder and harder to find. I know this is a \"2in1\" product, but I like to use a conditioner along with it."
5.00,"Very rich lather, pretty basic shampoo. Decent smell. Cleanses well. Nothing much more to it. Not overly drying. I use this to get styling products off my hair."
5.00,"Once I received it, I applied it. By the 3rd use I actually did not see flakes anymore, and still have yet to see dandruff. Works like a charm!"
5.00,"I haven't tried this yet but I've used other pantene shampoo and conditioner products & loved it. The price was great so I couldn't pass it up."
5.00,"I seen an ad for the pantene keratin in a magazine and I like pantene so I thought I would give it a try. I am african american and have very thick hair so not all products work on my hair. I bought the trial size which comes with the shampoo, conditioner, and split end remedy. As I was using it in the shower it felt like all other shampoos that make my hair tangled when I wash it but after using the conditioner and split end fuser my hair felt somewhat smooth after I blowdried it. My hair was soft and bouncy and its never been that bouncy before. Then I flat ironed it and I could not believe how smooth, shiny( after adding motions sheen) and incredibly bouncy it was! I was so amazed by how bouncy it was because my hair has.never been that bouncy after! I will definitely be purchasing a larger size this time. I definitley recommend it!"
5.00,"Pantene Pro-v Fine Hair Solutions Flat To Volume Shampoo is definitely a 5 Star Shampoo! I have used every really good shampoo for fine hair for several decades, so I have many different shampoos to compare this one to. After using Pantene's Pro-v for a few days, I am extremely impressed with it having all the great qualities that I require from a really good fine hair shampoo. The first thing I look for is a totally clear shampoo, because if you can see through it, it's not going to weigh down your fine hair, and this Pantene Pro-v is perfectly crystal clear. It has a lovely, very faint light citrus smell, which I like, as I don't like shampoo smells to clash with my favorite fragrances. It cleans really well and leaves your fine hair full of body and lift, which is exactly what a great fine hair shampoo should do. The main difference I noticed between my shampoo and this Pantene Pro-v is that Pantene Pro-v cleans really well, as in thoroughly super clean, leaving my hair much fuller with absolutely nothing weighing it down. When your hair is that clean, it's very important to use a good conditioner to replace lost moisture. Fine hair needs a very special type of conditioner that will not weigh hair down and flatten it, and the best conditioner I have ever found is one that rinses out minutes after it is put on after shampooing. This is a lovely light scented shampoo that cleans extremely well and leaves your fine hair feeling light, full and bouncy. Just remember to use a really good rinse-out, daily-use conditioner as this lovely 5 Star shampoo leaves your hair really squeaky clean!"
5.00,"Delivery was perfect. The product, very well known in the marketplace, works great on my ultra-fine straight hair, giving it lots of body and it smells good too!"
1.00,"I have very long thick hair. This product made my hair feel sticky and dirty. No matter how much I rinsed it, my hair still felt like I hadn't washed it in days. I'm definitely getting a refund for this one - had to shampoo my hair with a different shampoo to make it feel clean again. I would never recommend this Pantene product to anyone."
1.00,"I do not feel that this shampoo helps my color to last longer and I feel it is a bit drying. The dark color of the shampoo gets washed out twice, once after shampooing and again after conditioning. Not at all as advertized."
5.00,"Pantene is the only thing I swear by.. Well specifically their Nature Fusion line. As a swimmer and daily surfer, my hair is always such a frizzy mess that needs a lot of special chlorine-cleansing shampoos and leave-in conditioners to tame. This Nature Fusion Moisture Balance literally saved my frazzled hair and made it smooth and shiny in the first use (I've now been using it for over 5 months and it still gives me great results). This large size will seemingly last forever as well -- it's a good bargain. I use this shampoo along with Pantene's Smooth conditoner and my thick chestnut brown wavy hair always gets compliments. When I get asked what shampoo I use, I am proud to say its Pantene!"
5.00,"I use both the shampoo and conditioner, so this is a review for both used together.The scent is pleasant, not too strong. The shampoo lathers up really well without feeling like it is stripping the moisture from my hair. The conditioner is very rich. After washing and conditioning, my hair has less frizz and more shine. My hair does not feel weighed down at all, and still has good body. Benefits only, no drawbacks! My hair isn't super frizzy, but in the humid weather it tends to get a life of its own. I was surprised at how much I like it and I will definitely continue to use it!"
5.00,"This shampoo gives a great shine and body to your hair. And it smells so good! The shampoo is thicker and a bit creamier with a softening feel."
3.00,"I normally love Pantene Moisture Renewal, but my last order seemed \"watered down.\" This last set of shampoo and conditioner wasn't anything like what I've purchased in the store. I don't think I got what I paid for. I recently bought the same product at Target and it was as great as I remembered. Don't think I'll buy this on Amazon again."
5.00,"i noticed a difference just after the first use of my sample! i do know i will be switching to pantene thank you for the samples!!"
5.00,"So happy P&G brought this product back. It makes my silver hair beautiful. Forget artificial color. This is the best time of my life and my hair looks it."
5.00,"Perfect for curly hair. Tames the frizz and holds the curl. A must for every curly headed female. Excellent buy."
5.00,"This product is very good, this is a wonderful experience online. I will buy this item again online. It's new.~~~~"
5.00,"A fan of Pantene for a long time, I was used to hearing rumors of how 'bad' it was for your hair, etc. However, this never wavered my love for the Pantene. And this product, Pantene Pro-v Medium-thick hair solutions Frizzy to smooth shampoo just seals the deal.My hair is wavy -- often unmanageable. I can style it and one hhour later the waves have come through and the frizz has set in. With this shampoo, I noticed that with only two washings, the difference in the ability I had to style my hair and the style's shape to maintain, even in heat, went up considerably. When I flat iron my hair, that style actually stays for longer than just mere blowdrying.The price of this shampoo is reasonable and had it been more expensive, I would pay it. I liked it that much.Natalie S."
2.00,"It is one of the worst shampoos to use, as it makes your hair very dry and dull. Even after using a good conditioner, the hair looked dry and dull. I can't achieve the same results even with store brand bodywash."
5.00,"I've used Pantene products for years, and have always liked them very much, so i may be biased. But this shampoo is as good as the rest of their line. Works great, lathers well, makes my hair look soft and shiny. That's all I expect it to do, and it does it very well!"
2.00,"It's cheap, but you will be disappointed. My hair became oily after using it for two weeks. I don't recommend this product."
5.00,"I previously asked the owners about this product, because I have bleached hair that I've been trying to turn silver. As we all know, there is no silver hair dye- you have to bleach to ash blonde and then apply a blue/violet-based toner. No one answered my question properly so I went to walmart and bought a bottle for $6 or so.. OMG. PERFECT SILVER, no joke. I have used Wella brand Ash blonde toner, as well as Shimmer Lights purple Shampoo and so far nothing has given my hair the truly natural, silver/gray look better than the Pantene Silver Expressions. It literally took my hair from pale yellow to gray in one wash. It's perfect! Its' only about $2 cheaper than shimmer lights these days, but I will definitely be soon investing in the silver expressions conditioner, too because it worked so well! I can't review on what it does to naturally gray hair. Or naturally blonde hair, but for those people trying to achieve naturally-looking gray hair .. this is CERTAINLY worth a try. . .I just can't believe I could have saved myself the $30 on 2 wella toners, 2 bottles of purple shampoo and 1 bottle of purple conditioner and simply got this pantene. Hindsight, I guess."
5.00,"I am proud of my long silver hair!  This product shines it up and knocks out any yellowing.  In other words...it works and you don't have to use a hand full."
5.00,"Excellent product for limp, fine, fly away hair! This shampoo will improve your fine hair a lot, yet it rinses clean and seems to leave no residue. If you have fine hair, you must try it. Recommended."
5.00,"I stopped using pantene when they took this off the market a couple of years ago and squandered loads of money on salon brands to get the same results I was getting from this. I am glad they listened and brought it back. Makes my hair so incredibly shiny, bouncy and soft especially when coupled with the same conditioner. If you've hair that needs to be washed everyday and that tends to be weighed down by products then look no further than this."
5.00,"Great shampoo that doesn't leave hair greasy. The 2 pack is nice because I don't need to buy as often."
1.00,"I received this product for free to review from the Amazon Vine program. I ordered this shampoo to review because I am a satisfied user of other Pantene hair products. My family uses the Classic brand Pantene shampoo. I use the Pantene shampoo for color treated hair and sometimes a Pentene conditioner as well. They work well and we have been happy using these products - but I never noticed any obvious scent with those brands. This particular shampoo smelled so strong of a perfume-like scent that even in the shower I could wash it out of my hair fast enough. I can't tell you how it left my hair looking because I never got that far. There is no way I personally would ever wear something with that strong of a scent. I just don't think it is healthy for me or the people around me to breath in a strong, artificial scent like that all day long."
5.00,"Great buy for the price, Can't wait to try the procuct. I know Im going to love it !! !"
5.00,"I was looking for a shampoo and conditioner for my hair that would work better on my greys. Though I dye my hair and have for nearly 20 years, the greys are always a little wiry, harder to control. I'm at about 35% grey right now.                           This shampoo actually controls them better than anything else I've tried thus far. I started using it when I needed a trim, and it helped control frizz. After a hair cut, it worked even better. When I dyed my hair, I discovered I didn't have any color treated shampoo, so I used this and it was terrific. It's gentle, with a good scent.                           I don't get any extra body from the shampoo, but lustre and frizz control are well worth it. I definitely recommend giving this a try."
5.00,"You have a wonderful product, Pantene - couldn't be happier with the immediate results. I'm 76 years old with Hair Cuttery brown hair."
4.00,"For the money it is good. It is kind of odd that the price used to be 6 dollars and now it is 25, no idea what happened. Will start to use next week"
5.00,"I have been using this product, along with the conditioner, for about a week now and LOVE the results. My hair texture is softer and less frizzy. Even my coworkers have noticed a difference in my hair and have complemented me on it. I think I will be sticking with this shampoo for a while. Thanks Pantene!"
1.00,"I have relatively healthy, straight blonde hair and I get the occasional dry flake in the winter.  I like Pantene's other products so I tried this.  It did the job of eliminating flakes and moisturizing my scalp, but it's way too much moisture and it leaves my hair oily. Even immediately after washing and drying my hair, it looks extremely greasy at the roots. I do not recommend this product unless your hair is super dry from root to tip."
4.00,"This is the only shampoo that takes care of my dandruff and doesn't ravage my hair. I really like it."
5.00,"This is just a great, basic, no frills shampoo. There isn't a ton of extra softening agents or additives to make your hair anything other than clean. I have long, wavy, color treated hair, and this is perfect for me. My hair feels clean without feeling dry and stripped and it lathers well and I appreciate the very gentle, not overpowering scent. This is my new go-to shampoo that works well with pretty much every conditioner I've used it with! Also great family shampoo as it's gentle enough to use on my young children's hair and even the pets once in a while! The size is small to standard, but it goes a long way and is more than enough to last a few weeks for a family of three!"
5.00,"I like this shampoo and local stores don't seem to carry it. This was the best buy I found on Amazon for this product."
5.00,"It gave my really fine hair great volume. It seemed to last most of the day as well. It smells great too."
3.00,"It does not help untangling my hair. I have to use a real conditioner to untangle my hair after using this product."
4.00,"Pantene Pro V is a quality shampoo with a truly elegant scent. I am not sure if anyone would notice any age defying qualities as the name indicates but it is a very nice product. This was an Amazon Vine offering."
5.00,"Personally, I liked 90's Pantene scent lot more better, but this one is OK. This shampoo does makes your hair clean and manageable. If Pantene could bring back old 90's formula, that would be pretty nice. After all, it's a great shampoo after all."
5.00,"Great product. Having both shampoo and conditioner is a great idea. My hair feels silky and seems to stay clean longer without tangles."
1.00,"I had a horrible time correcting my scalp after trying pantene. It died my scalp so much, now it is dry, itchy and looks like dandruff. Yuck."
1.00,"Although the product might be okay, it was not what I ordered or what was pictured on your site. I was sent via email a postage paid label to return the product and did receive a full refund and apology."
5.00,"Love it! My hair alway is thick and healthy looking.. My fav shampoo around.. This is a great price.. :-)"
5.00,"For swimmers that don’t color their hair the Silver Shampoo is a necessity. The silver Shampoo should be widely available in stores. If any of the Pantene sales reps read this:              “please, put it back!”              Keep in touch"
4.00,"Love this shampoo. Ive tried the other kinds but keep coming back to Pantene Pro-V. My hair shines and feels cleaner"
5.00,"Leaves my hair clean (no residue like store brands often have) and smells great, while not overdrying my hair and giving me the swimmer's frazzle. Great value for one of the best shampoos I have tried, ever."
5.00,"LOVE the smell. that it actually moisturizes is a Bonus! However based on the smell alone i rate this 5+"
5.00,"Great shampoo, great value as an add-on! No dyes, very mild scent, light formula with little too residue. I love the size too!"
5.00,"I've got curly hair, and have used Pantene curly products for years and years. I couldn't find this product at several stores in my area anymore. So, I was pleasantly surprised to find this great big bottle at nice price on Amazon."
5.00,"I use this product every day when I shower. I like the way it leaves my hair. I have long, but soft hair, and I've used this product for several years."
5.00,"I wasn't able to find this product in stores, not sure why, didn't see it discontinued. Arrived in 2 days."
5.00,"My rather dry, shortish, mostly gray hair did respond well to the Pantene Pro-V Expert Collection Agedefy Shampoo (my what a long name), becoming softer and smoother without use of conditioner (which I intentionally left out in out to accurately guage the shampoo). It truly delivers as well (better?) as high-end salon brands I have used.                           Using this Pantene Pro-V, I noticed very mild scent that I have trouble classifying . . . maybe floral, but not really strongly feminine. Pleasant enough, but very muted and not a major feature of this shampoo.                           I thought the lather was relatively thin. On closer examination, the lather was actually quite creamy with a lot of body, but lacked a lot of the foaminess that I am used to with other brands.                           After air drying, I found my hair to be unusually soft and &quot;slick&quot; to the touch. Definitely. Again, this was without the use of a conditioner.                           I'm very pleased with this Pro-V Agedefy and was actually pleasantly surprised, as I generally find that among mainstream shampoos one is about as good as another and I end up with the same old stiff, dry, grayish hair. My hair is still gray (there are other products to address that as desired), but feels pleasingly soft and smooth.                           Make your own decisions about the price and how much you are willing to spend (this is not by any means cheap), but it is indeed an unusually good shampoo in my experience."
3.00,"While this is great for on-the-go days when you don't want to do a two step wash/condition, it doesn't seem suitable for my fine color-treated hair on an ongoing basis. By day three of use, my hair is looking dry and is flyaway. I'll continue to use it once or twice a week, but get best results using both shampoo and conditioner."
5.00,"Most hair care products seem to claim all kinds of promises but rarely deliver but I can truly say that this Protene Pro-V Volume Shampoo is fabulous! Not only does it give my fine limp hair lots of body and volume it does not build up on my hair and I don't have to use any type of clarifying shampoo to remove it. I use it every time I shower. Smells great and a little seems to go a long way... not just a regular lather happens but a very unusual luxurious rich type of creamy lather forms each time I use it - feels marvelous. And, it really honestly does give my hair volume and a terrific texture. Get the larger bottle for a bargain price."
1.00,"I am 29 yrs old Female. This was great at first for like the first 3 days, then after that is when the grossness started to seap in. I thought maybe i'm not rinsing it out good enough, so i hopped in the shower lathered my hair up with this sick stuff, and I made sure to spend extra time rinsing it ALL out, but to no availe, it just got worse. I waited till maybe my hair dried, and Nope! it just got worse., it felt like someone dumped glue on my hair!!! DON\"T BUY THIS PRODUCT, ITS NASTY!!!"
5.00,"I use all the time - although I switch off periodically because hair will become too conditioned or too dry depending on the product - so don't use same product continually or a long period of time"
5.00,"Leaves my hair clean and fresh...washes out clean and doesn't dull my hair. I am very pleased with this product, too bad it's becoming more and more difficult to find this shampoo. It's the best I've ever used for my baby fine hair."
5.00,"Cleans hair, works well. I still prefer shampoo and conditioner to 2 in 1. Would recommend. It's shampoo what am I supposed to say, there, I have enough words."
5.00,"Great shampoo at a great price. Does not leave any kind of oily residue and does not have an overpowering smell."
5.00,"Pantene Clarifying Shampoo Discontinued....Well I just called their offices and they are recommending a subsitute product as a replacement based solely on the fact it's \"CLEAR\" like the Clarifying Shampoo what a joke! You know I've been using this stuff for 8 years! I forgave Pantene when they cut the bottle size down by half (yet charged the same amount for it) but this is unbelievable..WAY TO ALIENATE YOUR CUSTOMERS!!!! I won't be buying your other products either now!"
4.00,"I have used Suave most of my adult life. Someone told me this is a great product and they are right. My hair is soft and silky after I use this conditioner."
5.00,"It makes my hair feel squeaky clean..some don't. Easy to handle size. Nice smell. Great price. Easy to order. Recommend"
5.00,"I only buy this shampoo because both my husband and I like it. Not only that, but amazon subscribe and save puts a bit more in my pocket and I get to receive it at my front door. A win-win :)"
5.00,"My Dad loves it and it makes a great \"gift\"... His hair looks very healthy and shinny!! Better than ever!"
4.00,"I love this shampoo for my color treated hair. It makes it very soft and shiny. Amazon has it at a great price."
5.00,"Since I've never used the previous version of Pantene's Sleek shampoo, I have found that this shampoo is quite the Godsend here in old humid Ohio. We've had over 100 degree weather here this week and well, if you're a bush head like me, you'll try about anything to keep from looking like a prized boxwood in the fanciest garden in England! Spray my hair green and voila! I'm in the gardening competition! But, you get the idea. Fuzzhead is never in style and this shampoo has worked wonders on my hair. No, it's not like using a straightening iron, no shampoo can really do that without applying a film of some sort, but this stuff comes really close. I also use Pantene's Great Lengths conditioner with this shampoo and it's just awesome. My hair is not brittle, not resembling being electrocuted, nor do I have birds swooping around looking for a nest anymore (I hatched some bluebirds this past Spring...).My suggestion is to try this product even if you're used to Pantene's previous shampoo. It's a great product and has tamed even the wildest head of hair in Ohio! Highly recommend!"
4.00,"We found the 2 in 1 pantene one time and really liked it. We couldnt find it again until we saw it on Amazon. Yhe pump is easy to use and auto shipping means we will have what we want when we need it. I wish they had a couple more choices for the type of shampoo."
5.00,"This shampoo is another excellent product from Pantene. It relieves itchy scalps but does not adversely affect my skin. This shampoo also softens my hair. I tried other anti-itch shampoos, but this Pantene shampoo works the best!"
5.00,"I have not used Pantene since high school and that was a LONG time ago. I usually use organic/natural shampoo + conditioners, but its becoming a bit too pricy and although they're good for your hair it left a build up I couldnt stand anymore as of recently. So I decided to check out some drugstore products and came across this. Silicone free? *Hmmm* Tried it and I am very impressed with the results. It did give my hair the shine that I wanted and I also picked up the conditioner and I loved how it wasnt heavy on my hair even after washing it out. I will definitely keep using this as long as Pantene keeps on making it. Highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for something light and affordable :)"
5.00,"I love Pantene shampoo & although there are a Zillion kinds I stay with this one.It gives your hair what it needs to be manageable & shiny! I find that Pantene winds up being cheaper as it takes less.It helps my budget & my hair!"
5.00,"I love the way my hair feels and is so shiny and easy to style. I have tried a lot of different shampoos, but I always go back to Pantene to keep my naturally curly hair manageable."
5.00,"It's about time PANTENE made a shampoo specifically for people with curly hair that actually moisturize like no other on the market."
5.00,"I noticed the volume of my hair increase the first time I used this product. And with baby fine hair, that is saying something! I also like the 2 in 1 and that I am having no sensitive skin reactions to the conditioner which is a constant problem for me. I can't imagine switching to another product."
5.00,"I love Pantene Pro-V Relaxed and Natural for Women of Color Shampoo. This is great shampoo with lots of moisturizers. Many African American women's hair tend to be dry. This works great for dryness. It makes my hair feel very soft and manageable. Thank you Pantene for this shampoo. I will buy this product again."
3.00,"I've tried several shampoos for grey or silver hair, all claiming to remove the yellow tinge that comes from impurities in the water.  Nothing has worked yet, and this shampoo is the same as the others.  My hair still has a yellow tinge, I've been using it for 2 weeks now.                                              It's a good shampoo in general, my hair is in good condition, but that's all. No other benefit."
5.00,"This was recently on sale at my local grocery store so I decided to try it. I've tried many shampoos and conditioners and they all seem about the same, so I wasn't really expecting much. I love the Nature Fusion shampoo and conditioner! My hair is so soft now! This is my new shampoo and conditioner!"
4.00,"I have naturally blonde hair but I dye it blonder and usually have highlights. So a color shampoo specifically for blonds sounded great! I however, don't notice a difference in my hair after using this shampoo. Its hard to tell when I use a color conditioner as well. It smells great though but is a lot cheaper at the drug store! its only like $6 at the drugstore."
5.00,"Love this product! The shampoo and conditioner complement each other and my hair feels soft and stays clean with these two products. I have tried many other shampoos and conditioners over the years, but I always come back to these. My hairdresser says they are crap, but I use them anyway and he always remarks on the health of my hair! Go figure... This shampoo works great for my hair and scalp. I love the clean feeling and the shine! Less breakage and fewer split ends, too."
3.00,"I used this product for two days because I have incredibly flat hair and just wanted some oompf. I give it a 3 because the product does what it says it will; it gives flat hair volume. However it was a funky sort of volume. My hair looked like it wanted to have some volume but wasn't quite sure how to stop being flat. That's the best way I can describe it. The shampoo also left my scalp incredibly dry. I found myself wanting to constantly itch. I had to restrain myself from doing so in public. I guess if you really can't afford the more expensive stuff you could give patene a try. If I were you though, I would consider forking over just a bit more dough for something better. I decided to give Giovanni Max Volume a try and that stuff works great. My hair has volume and is incredibly soft and silky. Of course I got it on clearance at TJ Maxx so I'm not sure if it's still in most stores."
2.00,"I purchased this shampoo& conditioner set due to the decent ratings from previous customers. I usually use an expensive salon hydrating shampoo ,Pureology, which is also purple in color and has a light fresh scent. Pantene, however, has a strong smell, I associate with perm chemicals. After using this product twice, I noticed my shiny silver hair was dulling to a faded yellow and it made my scalp itch like crazy ! I'll be going back to my tried and true Pureology Hydrate and returning this. Pantene needs to change up their formula and scent."
2.00,"After only one use, the color on my 'virgin' hair (roots) was GONE! In addition, it totally 'undid' my keratin treatment. Yes, my hair was drier, so appeared fuller, but the side-effects just aren't worth it."
5.00,"Until about 2 years ago, my hair was always straight. For some reason it started really curling at the ends naturally and frizzing too! I bought this because it was suppoed to manage my hair/curls better and it seems to work. Other shampoos didn't effect my hair at all in this way, but Pantene does."
5.00,"i been having trouble with dandruff for a year now and this pantene product finally has worked. at first it would just relieve the itching i got comfortable with that because it was revealing. but i was still upset that i had dandruff. i got this product August 13 and and now oct 15, the dandruff is going away, i only have a little bit and it's going away and no more itching."
5.00,"As I've gotten older my hair has thinned and no longer has good body, so I eagerly tried this shampoo with the hope it would give my hair the 'fluff' I tend to be missing.  I'm very pleased with the results so far.  It provides more lift and stylability than I've achieved with other shampoos. My hair is looking better than it has in a while. Since my hair isn't oily, I was a little concerned that the extra lift is reportedly achieved by removing oil from the hair. My hair doesn't look or feel dry after use, but still I thought I should add the companion conditioner just to be safe.  So far am pleased with it too.  Most conditioners make my hair hopelessly flat, but this product works well with the shampoo and doesn't counteract the shampoo's benefits.                                                                     After using this shampoo, my scalp, which tends to be itchy, also feels good.  Since I use a lot of hair spray, I wonder if it is more effective at removing that residue from my scalp than other shampoos.  Don't know, but I do know my scalp feels better and my hair looks good.  Can't beat that. I'm very pleased with this product and recommend it to others who need a boost in the hair department."
3.00,"great price for the subscription. shampoo in the house with no trouble. however, the bottle is a little heavy for me. Might look for smaller size next time."
5.00,"I have extremely long hair, so the little bottles of conditioner are used-up very quickly. This cream rinse is wonderful at helping me keep my hair shiny and tangle-free, and the pump works down to the last little bit in the bottle."
5.00,"My hair is very dry and frizzy especially after perms. I used other Pantene products prior to use of Advanced Keratin Repair products but they did not help my hair condition. These products do! My hair is shiiny and much less frizzy. The shampoo lathers very well and is rich and thick. The conditioner rinses cleanly, hair feels smooth."
5.00,"My husband and I have used Pantene Fine and were lucky enough to get it from Costo in bulk for years. Recently they changed the product they stocked to Pantene Classic, which we don't care for. We found that Amazon stocks the Fine and we can have it shipped for free with Prime. This product is clear, crisp, lathers well with a small amount and does not leave a residue. I'd recommend it to anyone that likes shampoo that rinses well. I also use the Fine conditioner and it works well."
5.00,"I ended up buying this at local store because it was cheaper. My husband has silver hair, I have chemically highlighted hair with gray at temples. The shampoo and conditioner leaves hair very very soft and shiny. Did not leave any purple residue in my highlights. use once a week."
5.00,"This item is hard to find in stores I love how fast it was shipped to me ..Promt service thanks"
3.00,"First things first, I did not wash the cat in it, I bent down to pet her right after I had washed my hair and she sniffed my hair and started to sneeze. I have very fine, long, and fragile hair. I do not color my hair or use a blow dryer on it. I let it dry naturally after gently wrapping a towel around it to absorb most of the water. I usually use the Garnier Length and Strength shampoo. Pros: Hair feels smooth as you rinse the shampoo out Lots of lather Cons: Smell is not attractive, smells a bit like flowers with alot of chemicals My hair now has a \"fly-away\" problem, which I usually only have in winter when it is dry outside and my hair has alot of static. I am losing more hair than usual on a daily basis since I started using this, normally my daily normal \"fall-out\" of hair is 10 or less, since I started using this and the matching conditioner, I am loosing about 30 strands a day My hair looks duller. Overall conclusion, I am going back to my usual shampoo and conditioner and not going to use this on a regular basis."
4.00,"Four years ago, my hair was a few inches longer than my collarbone. It refused to grow any longer than that, and I was very frustrated. When I went to buy some Biotin, the salesperson recommended this shampoo and conditioner. It worked really well to help me grow my hair MUCH longer. It is now way past the middle of my back and has been that way for over a year. This shampoo and conditioner combo really worked to finally grow my hair longer. I have also been air-drying my hair whenever possible, so that has made a big difference in breakage. I really recommend this for anyone who struggles with growing their hair longer."
5.00,"My hair texture is fine, it's long and color treated. I bought both the Pro-V Repair & Protect shampoo and conditioner. The shampoo has lots of suds, which I like, rinses out well. The conditioner takes the knots right out, and lessens brakage. After using both products for about two weeks, I have notice improvement, leaves my hair soft, more manageable, and with less fly-aways. Good value for the money........."
5.00,"I really believe it helps your blonde hair stay blonder. I really love the product"
5.00,"My daughter keeps using this shampoo that I got for myself. We both have curly thick hair and it keeps our hair moist and frizz free! the scent is nice, not too strong. I think we have found our new favorite shampoo!"
4.00,"I have tried several different products over the years. This one is better than most, especially since my hair has no \"purple\" tinge after once weekly use."
5.00,"This paricular type of Pantene is impossible to find in stores anymore. Good price for large pump bottle. Would purchase again."
5.00,"Pantene has been a great shampoo for years now. I really like it and now that I have this I am totally stocked up for awhile."
3.00,"It's the same as with the Hair Mask. After a few uses my hair becomes full of static and hard to manage. Read my rating and description on that."
4.00,"My hair is short, blonde, color-treated to cover some grays, and somewhat dry. Lately, the color has been looking kind of dull, as well. So I decided to give AgeDefy a try. I'll start with the basics: The consistency of the shampoo is thick, almost like a body lotion, and the color is a dull yellow. As for fragrance, it has a pleasant, light, lemony fragrance, not at all overpowering, and the aroma disappears entirely after you rinse it out. A quarter-sized amount was sufficient to give a nice lather. (As I said, my hair is short. Longer hair might need a bit more product to shampoo.) Beyond the basics: The product professes to fight 7 signs of aging, including: 1) Breakage. I don't have any breakage, so I can't speak to this one. 2) Split ends. Once again, I don't have any, so I can't attest to effectiveness here. 3) Frizz. Great frizz control. I don't have a big problem with frizz, but my hair is bleached, and if I over-dry it, it becomes a \"cotton-ball\" texture. With this shampoo, I was able to blow dry to the completely dry stage, with NO frizz effect whatsoever. 4) Unruly grays. Exceptional control of the wiry grays down by my neckline. They were straight and smooth after shampooing. 5) Lackluster color. Gave a great shine! Usually I have a tiny amount of shine because I use a smoothing serum after blow drying. With this shampoo, I did not use the serum, and had noticeable shine. 6) Thin look. It did seem to \"plump-up\" the hair in the crown area, making it look fuller. 7) Dryness. Wonderful result. A nice smooth finish, a silky feel, and this was WITHOUT using any conditioner. Overall, I felt my hair really did look \"younger\" and healthier after using AgeDefy. So, why only four stars? Well, I felt some users might be bothered by the ingredients, which include sodium lauryl sulfate, as well as many ingredients that are unpronounceable. (Methyusothiazolinone, anyone?) In other words, some users might not care for as many chemicals in their shampoo. But if you don't mind the occasional foray into beauty-through-chemistry, and you want a fountain of youth for your aging hair, this may well be your new favorite shampoo."
5.00,"I have long, very thick hair with years of highlights. this shampoo and conditioner makes my usually very thick tangled hair silky smooth and easy to brush after i shower. I have tried a ton of products over the years and I am fianlly very happy with this product. most shampoo/cond makes my hair a tangled mess, this has worked great for a few months! i definitely plan to stick with this for a while."
5.00,"All my life I have had issues with my hair, with it either being to oily or too dry. I have had terrible trouble trying to find a balance. In the last few months my hair has not been able to recover from being super dry and brittle. I had gotten to the point where all I could do was wear it up and hide it until my next hair cut. I had tried every product under the sun, from really expensive to really cheap and nothing worked. Until I saw a commercial for the keratin repair. So I went out and bought both the shampoo and conditioner and gave it a try. After only one use I can already tell that my hair is so much healthier! I honestly cant believe the change it did. Its like I have a totally new head of hair and I am no longer ashamed of how it looks anymore. I am already starting to wear my hair down and show it off. I couldnt be any happier with my hair. I could almost cry! I cant wait to keep using this product and see how healthy my hair can get! Thank you for a wonderful product!"
5.00,"This is always the one brand I come back to. Great quality, with wonderful results. Larger bottle than you find in the stores. Very moisturizing, not heavy on my fine hair."
5.00,"This specific pantene shampoo is rated very highly for being healthy without the neurotoxins used in most shampoos to hold scents (see [...] to rate your shampoo).  In addition, it works very well moisturing and cleaning and unlike many other healthy shampoos it doesn't open the hair platelets too far and therefore doesn't feel so dry and sticky so I can get away without using a conditioner.  Great value."
5.00,"I have been using the Shampoo and Conditioner for a few days and it has made my hair a lot better from what I was using before. My hair is not super unruly or curly but it can get frizzy and I have noticed the frizz is well controlled with this product. The shampoo feels a little drying but the conditioner moisturizes well. Combined with a little gel my hair is soft, light, and has nice defined curls."
5.00,"I ordered it since I ran out of shampoo. Surprisingly found the light smell and soft texture after the use. Like it a lot.Considering the price, i cannot expect for more."
5.00,"this is about the same price as buying it at the store but the bonus is its delivered for free and it has a nice pump that lasts as long as the bottle does even when dropped"
5.00,"Have not use it yet. I think it is a very good deal compared with that I get in the local grocery store."
5.00,"i have gotten lots of compliments about my gray hair since I started using Pantene Pro-V Silver."
5.00,"Here's another one of those lower-priced products that promises so much, and probably delivers nothing, right? Wrong! This shampoo and conditioner from Pantene really works!                                                                     First of all, let's start with what it's not. It's not a dying shampoo which will make your hair brown, or even a different shade of brown. Quite to the contrary, Brunette Expressions has no color enhancing ingredients whatsoever.                                                                     Instead, Brunette Expressions is an excellent shampoo and conditioner that somehow works with your hair's color to not change it (as the daily use of some products will!), but to actually make it look more rich. I love the way that Brunette Expressions makes my hair so soft and lustrous, and so very manageable. This is a great product, one that I highly recommend to all my fellow brunettes!                                                                     (Review of Pantene Pro-V Brunette Expressions Daily Color Enhancing Shampoo for Darker Brunette Shades, Nutmeg to Dark Chocolate)"
5.00,"I love this shampoo. I've used it twice and the result is noticeably smoother, shinier hair. It even feels silkier (like gray silk, in my case). My hair is on the dry side so this might be too heavy for oilier hair, but otherwise I really recommend it."
5.00,"I decided to try this product after hearing that it should help with breakage and thinning hair. I used the shampoo, conditioner, and the treatment. After about 2 weeks, I had a noticeable difference in how much less hair was around the drain and on the floor after blow drying. I was also happy with the results during styling as well."
5.00,"Pantene will always be my all-time favorite...just the smell alone had me sold years ago. Shiny hair...smells great and hair is clean."
5.00,"Great shampoo for grey hair, keeps hair shiny."
1.00,"The product I received was not what I ordered.  It was a different type of Pantene.  I returned the package the same day, (at my expense) because it was not what I ordered.  I was a 25.4 oz bottle, but not the Pro V, Daily Moisture Renewal Moisturizing Shampoo for Dry or Damaged hair.  I was very disappointed that it was not the right kind because I had searched quite a while for it."
3.00,"I am using the product because I don't want to waste the money by throwing it away. However, some sort of sheen or cream must be used to counteract the dryness left on the hair."
4.00,"This shampoo works really well with my hair, which is very fine, dry and thin. After using it twice, my hair felt softer, fuller and has more movement. I have a collection of more expensive shampoos in my shower, such as Fekkai, Kerastasse and Nioxin, and none of them come close to giving similar results as Age Defy did. All the volumizing formulas dried out my hair and made it impossible to brush out and actually left it more limp than before. I use about a teaspoon amount, add some water and massage it onto my scalp. It lathers really well after massaging it evenly on my head for about a minute. I don't use a conditioner and it still allows me to brush out my hair nicely after I towel dried it. It doesn't weigh my hair down at all, which is amazing for by baby fine hair. I give it 4 stars only because of the steep price. $8 for a bottle of shampoo is a lot for me, but since I use a small amount and wash my hair every 2 or 3 days, it's worth it for me. I actually like how it looks on the second day better, where it's softer and smoother. I also tried the thickening treatment. It does what it promised and gave me fuller and more voluminous hair but it contains alcohol denat, an ingredient that I'm not familiar with and it raised some questionable side effects, thus, I'm holding off on it for now. Hope this helps!"
5.00,"I've tried a lot of shampoos over the years and I like this Pantene Pro-V Expert the best yet. I was skeptical of the claims but it performed better than any other shampoo I've tried. It does an excellent job of cleaning my hair. It seems to make my hair shine nicely. I have fewer tangles after shampooing and they are easier to untangle. It also seems to add some volume to my hair but no more than some of the other volumizing shampoos I've tried but my hair is more manageable than any other. Also you don't need much which was surprising, I'm using only a little dollop and get plenty of lather, makes it good value for the money. This Pantene Pro-V Expert will be the shampoo I used exclusively from now on. If you are still looking for a shampoo that does more than the one you are now using, try this Pantene Pro-V Expert."
3.00,"This shampoo really doesn't work for me. It makes my hair too flat and lifeless, thought it does do a good job of cleaning and smells quite nice!"
2.00,"I had ordered this in April and it was sold by mnmsales back then. I ordered just the shampoo but received the 2 in 1 which has conditioner in it. Conditioner makes my hair fall but this one was okay, neither great nor bad. Ordered another one now sold by a different seller. Hope it arrives correct. Dec 26 2013: Received this item quickly but it says it expires 12/2013. What a bummer! And it's such a pain to pack and return a shampoo bottle. I guess I'll just throw it away!!"
5.00,"This product really made my hair look and feel good. Seeing the purple color when it comes out of the bottle is a bit disconcerting but the purple did not affect my hair color at all."
4.00,"I thought that the shampoo has an awsome bottle, like chocolate! I guess it made my hair shiner, after only one use I wouldn't know. I feel special to have brunette shampoo, it seemed like everything used to be for blondes! I am glad brunettes have a shampoo that \"enhances\" our natural beauty! I don't know if the product works like it should, but the product bottle and the idea is awsome! I especially love the \"Nutmeg to Dark Chocolate\" title. It makes me really want to use it, I love chocolate! I don't give it 5 stars because it lacks a certain quality I just can't put my finger on...but I love the way the bottle looks which is key!:)(Did I say that enough times?)"
5.00,"I have relaxed hair and this is actually the only shampoo I use. I wash with this and immediately after I do a co-wash with just about any conditioner I can find and my hair always comes out soft."
1.00,"Used this for my fine shoulder length thin hair a for about 3 times, my hair looks like it hasn't been washed for WEEKS!! This shampoo from Pentene GOT TO GO!! It's the WORST shampoo I've ever used!!"
4.00,"Good for grey hair because it reduces residue - which sounds to me like something anyone would like. I switch with neutrogena occasionally mainly since i am paranoid about the \"blue hair\" look, though i have never gotten that with this product."
5.00,"I wish I could give this 6 stars!!! I have been using this shampoo for about 3 weeks now and my hair hasn't been this soft in years! I have also noticed that my scalp is not as dry as it used to be. My split ends are smoothing out and my hair is far less tangled than before. I was using garnier and herbal essences products before, but I'm never going back again. I have long thick hair and all those brands seemed to do was dry it out until I started looking like I'd stuck my finger in an outlet. I started to hate my own hair. Now I love it again. It's soft and smooth, and I also have far less hair falling out from breakage. Awesome shampoo & conditioner in one!!!"
5.00,"I like this shampoo. It works well and it seems to be keeping my brown hair brown, although there is also a bit of gray mixed in. It's hard to find in stores, but Amazon usually has what I can't find stores, so I am happy."
5.00,"This shampoo is incredibly good. After just one wash my hair was soft as silk, maleable, shiny, gorgeous. And the Conditioner does not leave my hair heavy nor builds up. I cannot recommend it enough for any kind of hair!"
4.00,"I tried this product out to, like everyone else who bought it, hopefully bring some life to my limp hair! I did notice a little bit of a difference after the first use, but after continued use of the shampoo (almost through the whole bottle) I hardly see any great changes. I use the hairspray, shampoo, conditioner, heat protectant spray, and volumizing gel. The volumizing gel does make a great difference versus shampoo and conditioner alone. Even though I didn't get the results I hoped for from this product, I still use it because Pantene altogether has made my hair stronger and much healthier! Good product, affordable system."
2.00,"This shampoo made my fine, slightly wavy hair frizzy. It only increased volume because of the frizz. The corresponding conditioner and the thickening treatment are OK, but I stopped using this shampoo within the first week."
5.00,"I love the smell and it works well on my hair even without the conditioner. However, I use it in combination with the Conditioner & the Serum and my hair is soft and manageable EVERY day!"
5.00,"Over the years, I think I've used any product that promised to make my curls shiny, moist with frizz control. This is the best I've ever used for my curls. The previous product was too heavy and frankly greasy. This one is just right!"
5.00,"I bought it for my parents. They seems like it and use it in every shower. Their hair looks good, at least not worst than before. They works like other shampoo, but hard to say how many improvement it can make to the colored hair. As long as I didn't see anything wrong with my parents' hair, I just give it a 5 star."
5.00,"I like this product. It's strictly for natural gray hair. I combine it with my regular shampoo. I do not use it straight."
4.00,"Price was a little to high I should have shopped a little more. But I do love the Shampoo great for color treated hair."
4.00,"this is an ok shampoo I would not recommend it to anyone with damaged hair, because my hair has no damage and it left it a little dry. It seemed like I had to use twice the conditioner which counter acted the weightlessness."
4.00,"Wow, I was really impressed with this new conditioner. It's got a great scent, & feels like silk (no kidding here) when putting it in your hair. I typically have very thick & frizzy so am always on the look out for the next best thing when it comes to conditioners, I thought I'd give this a shot & am glad I did. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is due to the commercial. They advertise that you're supposed to wake up in the morning without the frizzy do. I kinda assumed this was BS from the get go & therefore am not being uber critical, but there you have the 4 stars. Another thing I'd like to add is normally when using conditioners my hair is very tangly after a shower, with this though no tangles at all. In the end I'm very satisfied with my purchase & would definately buy this again."
5.00,"I really do think this shampoo works!  My hair is now the longest it has ever been!  I color my hair, and I have very fine hair, so it is difficult to get it to grow, as it has a tendency to break.  It is growing now!"
5.00,"This shampoo makes my very dry and frizzy hair feel so soft and silky. I can't live without it. Does everything it states it will do. Love this product."
5.00,"Been using this product for years, however Amazon was the only place I could find it. All the stores are out... Is this being discontinued? I hope not!"
4.00,"I have tried numerous drugstore brands of shampoo/conditioner and really like this one! I have long, fine hair that gets flat (especially between haircuts). After using this for a week, I can already tell the difference. My hair is softer, smells nice, and has more shine than with other products. It has more volume than before, but that may be because I was using the wrong product for my hair type. I will definitely try the separate shampoo and conditioner in this line!"
5.00,"Pantene, as always, does exactly what it is supposed to do. This shampoo gives me a lot less fly-aways and of course the shine that I only get from this brand. As for strength over time, I hope to update on that after I have used this product for several months. So far, this is a keeper!"
5.00,"Much better than what I expected...great product and great price. I really like pantene and this shampoo works very well for me."
5.00,"Before using Pantene I would buy expensive shampoo/conditioner expecting great results. My first week using Pantene fine hair solution products and Im in love it with it. My hair feels full and has a lot of volume. The great part of it is that i didn't have to spend more than 10.00 to have great manageable hair.."
5.00,"My hair is thinning so I purchased this product to help with that problem. It is a very nice shampoo, I hope I get the desired results."
5.00,"I order this in bulk from Amazon every 3 months. I save money and get my favorite shampoo in big bottles which I enjoy. The shampoo gets my hair clean and keeps it soft and fluffy. I always feel good when I wash my hair with Pantene Thick Hair Moisture Renewal."
3.00,"The product is okay. It does the job what i needed to do. I recommend it for Brunettes to use."
5.00,"I have been using this dandruff shampoo for over a decade. I have been using Pantene products for over 30 years, back when you could only purchase at fine department stores under glass prior to mass production. Not only is this dandruff shampoo very effective, it leaves your hair soft, silky, and wonderful to the touch. I freaked out when Pantene discontinued the anti-dandruff shampoo for a while and I actually called them voiced my disappointment. Months later, they sent me a coupon and a letter saying they were bringing it back and they have listened to my \"passionate comments\". (Along with many other I suspect). So Far, I can only find the Pantene Anti-Dandruff here on Amazon. My package arrived quickly and in perfect condition, and I was so thrilled to receive it!"
5.00,"I have been using a salon shampoo for my blonde, more on the fine side, hair for many years. Each salon bottle costs 20.00, and I have loved it so much, that I have been afraid to try something else, but I have been getting tired of spending tons of money on my shampoo. . I saw the Pantene Volume Shampoo on sale at my local pharmacy and thought I would give it a try. It lathered so well when washing, and smells terrific! Overall, my hair is more shiny than usual, and it has tons of volume that stays all day. I love this shampoo and will continue to use it! Good bye to my expensive salon shampoo!"
5.00,"After using this product, my hair feels softer great."
5.00,"This made my hair really soft and shiny and manageable. Years of colortreating has left my hair dull and brittle. This brought some shine back and softness. My employee asked me what I used to make my hair so shiny!"
2.00,"It was okay. Did not do what it said. My hair was not whiter, it looked dull. Went back to other \"purple\" shampoo."
5.00,"I agree with the other reviewers. I had a problem of finding hair all over my bathroom, then wondering why my hair was so thin. I definitely noticed a reduction of hair all over and my hair looking thicker with this shampoo. I also noticed it fast! I'd say in 2 weeks. It smells great, lathers well and is lasting... forever!"
5.00,"LOVED IT!"
4.00,"I like this product, I purchase it all the time. Now, it doesn't help to maintain my color like the blonde conditioner does, but it is the same quality and keep as other pantene products, and in the store, cheaper then them most of the time. If you are looking for a shampoo to maintain brunette hair that is dyed, this isn't the product for you, if you are looking for a good pantene shampoo in general, then you'll love this product. This is a short review compared to my others because it is so much like the other shampoos in Pantene there is not much to say about it."
4.00,"I brought this product just to try. I have noticed that my hair hasn't benn brakiing off as much as it was. I am in a area where they water is really bad and this seems to be saving my hair"
5.00,"I love this shampoo, I use it with the conditioner. This is NOT to help colored hair to last longer, it is to help your natural brunette color look better, which it does for me. My hair is also more shinny and softer."
5.00,"I like it because it makes my hair smooth and shiny, also the bottle is a good size not too large or too small."
1.00,"I like this shampoo and have ordered it from Amazon before, but the latest batch is a different kind! Instead of just NatureFusion, it is the one with Melon Essence! Amazon please fix your product description / photo and send me the correct product."
5.00,"I absolutely love this pantene shampoo. I'm a hairdresser and use it in my own hair over the salon products that I sell. I'll often tell a client with very damaged hair to try Pantene because of it's restorative properties. I think this is an excellent every day product."
5.00,"Great shampoo, leaves your hair so smooth. I like the size bottle for the smaller hands in our family. some of the large bottles of other brands make it hard for the kids to use."
4.00,"Having thin hair, I've searched for shampoo to add a little oomph to my flat, thin hair. Most make promises they can't keep. The new Pantene however, does just that. Too good to be true, right? Well, somewhat. While it gives it the extra volume I need, it doesn't hold last until day 2 as advertised. Since it does live up to may expectations but just not as long, I rank it four stars. (Tip: Pantene Pro-V Fine Hair Solutions Flat to Volume Shampoo and Conditioner doesn't weight down hair like many conditioners do to flat hair AND it adds more shine. This is definitely the Pantene product of my choice.)"
5.00,"I would tell all my friends about this product it's the best and the price was fair and on time."
1.00,"Shampoo itself is ok.. amazon advertised it as Pack of 3.. I have screen prints too saying pack of 3.. when I contacted amazon, they said I will receive only 1.. and when I asked I want to return, I was asked to pay 3.99 in s/h .. this is ridiculous amazon! we expect better from you."
5.00,"Love my pantene expressions. It keeps my blonde hair blonde without making it brassy. I alternate between the blonde expression and the highlighting expression"
5.00,"I used this shampoo along with the conditioner and got great results!! I have wavy hair that tends to get a bit frizzy and this shampoo did a great job of smoothing my hair. Love that it has anti-aging benefits and can be used daily."
4.00,"Good value for shampoo. Smells nice. Way cheaper than buying one at a time in the store. Hair feels nice after shampooing - see no difference between this and the expensive stuff."
1.00,"Why has Pantene dropped the Clarifying Shampoo?? It had been rated the # 2 clarifying shampoo, yet it is not worthy enough to continue. I have used it for years and am extremely disappointed that it has been discontinued. This product is not quite an adequate replacement!!!"
5.00,"I am a black female, going from perm to natural hair. I have spent a lot of money on shampoos and conditioners and never thought Pantene could do anything \"good\" for my hair. After just one shampoo, my hair is soft, it stopped shedding almost immediately. The conditioner is amazing as well!"
5.00,"After a unsucessful attempt to bleach my very healthy naturally Dark/Almost Black hair not once but 3 times in a week. I was left with dry hair with a texture similar to the plastic used for Baby dolls, very rough. After one use I was truly amazed! Having thin hair these types of products typically weight my hair down and this did not. It actually felt soft, light and a bonus for me of no static I wash every 3 days or so and have now used this twice and and very happy with the results. I am also keeping a picture log and review of this for my own benefit to refer to track damage repair. I also use the conditioner as well."
5.00,"First time I used this, my hair instantly felt lighter, even while it was still wet. I have very long and thick hair so I am used to my hair feeling heavy. After drying and running a flat iron through it, my hair feels flowy and light. My hair usually doesn't hold any scent from shampoo/conditioner but this scent stays in my hair well into the second day, and the scent is pleasant. I have highlighted hair so shine isn't really seen in my hair anyways but I will be interested in seeing is this shampoo does make my hair seem dull or lackluster in the fall when I go brunette. I am on my 3rd big bottle right now and will try another shampoo after this one is empty just because I always switch it up but I will definitely be back to this soon!"
5.00,"Turning 50 i decided to let my hair grow out its natural colr. My boyfriend tells me people pay big buck to have hair look like mine. I cut out all the colored hair and grew out natural. without this shampoo it looks old and dull. This brightens and takes the brassy greys and makes them look more like a professional highlight. Really loving my hair and will not be without this shampoo!"
5.00,"Product does what it claims.... leaves hair looking thicker."
5.00,"I have dry brittle hair so i was looking for something with moisture,this shampoo has that without making my hair limp,I love this product."
1.00,"I have been a faithful user of the Pantene Volume line for a very LONG time. They have discontinued that line in favor of this \"new & improved\" line. Well, in good faith I tried it for a couple weeks. SORRY PANTENE, THIS STUFF DOES **NOT** WORK. This \"new\" formula leaves my hair dull and super staticky and extremely flyaway...what a HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT. No volume, no shine, no manageability. My hair is very fine and sensitive, and I must say I settled on the Pantene Volume line after trying a LOT of others...from off the shelf to salon lines. Believe me...been there, done that. How incredibly stupid and short-sighted of Pantene to discontinue this line, and all the others. From a HUGE selection of speciality product lines, that showed they recognized that all hair types and conditions are not the same, and showed respect for consumers' preferences and choices, down to only 4 sub-standard choices...well. Even the new name shows lack of respect to their consumers. \"Flat\" indeed!! I will now have to stock up on my regular Volume favorites at premium prices from elsewhere and try and find something else that works when that runs out. I am super pissed! Just one more thing that I love, discontinued once again. Once I find a new product line that works, you may rest assured that I will NEVER buy another Pantene product ever again."
5.00,"I use a lot of hair products, and this shampoo really cleans them all out of my hair, and leaves it soft and shiny."
4.00,"This shampoo has a very nice, light herbal smell, lathers well, and does a nice job cleaning my hair, leaving my hair feeling soft and managable. I like the results of Pantene Pro-V Agedefy and it works for me as an everyday shampoo. Recommended!"
3.00,"I have been using Pantene Shampoo for years, and this product proved to be no different in quality; however, although this shampoo mildly controlled my frizz, I didn't find this shampoo to be the best for my hair. I tend to have very frizzy hair year round, and during summer, my hair is even frizzier; therefore, I decided to try this shampoo to note how much hair control I'd have after each use. To be frank, the product was quite good. As usual, my hair was soft, smooth, and smelled nice! However, Pantene has another product, Pantene Pro-V Restoratives Frizz Control Shampoo (http://www.amazon.com/Pantene-Pro-V-Restoratives-Control-Shampoo/dp/B000GCX ROS/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_top ), which works much better to control frizz. I have been using the latter product for several years now, but since Pantene came out with a new product, I wanted to compare the quality. Hands down, \"Frizzy to Smooth\" shampoo was a good product to simply clean your hair, leaving it smelling nice and smooth, but for its intention of controlling frizz, I highly recommend Pantene's \"restoratives\" line. Perhaps \"Frizzy to Smooth\" shampoo did work for some, but for me, a person with extreme frizz, the latter product was much better (conditioner included). I still recommend someone in need of frizz control to give this product a shot, because not everyone's hair is same and has the same results. The product itself is not a bad one, but it is also not the best for frizz control."
3.00,"What really is \"aging\" hair? I would think hair without color. Colorless hair is usually straighter, too, and less flexible. This product claims to minimize color loss, but I don't know how it does that. I still see my gray roots. How is it minimizing it? I really haven't felt like I have had clean hair since I started using this sample bottle. The shampoo is the color of light dirt and is thick, so because it claims to reduce frizzies and dryness -- frizzies are more a quality of youthful hair, which still has enough body to frizz -- I think it has some kind of grease in it. My first and second days after a shampoo do seem like the hair is well under control, but after the second day, my head feels desperately in need of washing again."
5.00,"This combination shampoo and conditioner is quick and easy to use, which is a plus for busy people. I've had a hard time finding a combination product that makes my hair strong and easy to manage, so I was pleased to find this one.  The problem is that I can no longer find it at local stores.  It was great to see it at Amazon."
5.00,"Curly Hair you have to love it, finally they have a shampoo and moisturizer that works."
5.00,"But my fine, straight hair does feel a bit more thick, with a bit more body. I wash my hair every other day. The only product I use is a volumizer made by Redken. With other shampoos, I've needed to use hair spray to retain any volume. With this shampoo, the volumizer is all I need to keep my hair from falling flat after a few hours. It lathers nicely. After rinsing, I get the \"squeak\" that indicates clean hair, but it feels like it feels when I've used a conditioner -- like there's a slight residue. I'm okay with that, because whatever is left on my hair has helped with dryness. My hair hasn't been fly-away at this time of year (winter heating, dry air) like it usually is. The scent reminds me of patchouli but it's not obnoxious. Overall, I like it, and will keep using it until the next new shampoo comes along. I love trying new shampoos, and my hairdressers have always recommended changing up. UPDATE: I've since used two other shampoos and have gone back to this one (and added a star to the rating). It's the only shampoo that's made a noticeable difference in my hair's volume and body. I don't even have to use the volumizer. My stylist tells me that it's good to change shampoos occasionally, but this one will be my mainstay."
5.00,"this is the best conditioner that works on my frizzy curly hair....will switch with pantene and other p&g products for my hair"
5.00,"Don't need a lot to thoroughly clean your hair and leaves gray looking thick and natural. Buy this if you have gray hair and you want to look great."
1.00,"I used to buy the one previous to this product and it would give my hair wonderful volume and my hair would feel clean for up to 2 days. This new brand that's out doesn't even last a day in making my hair feel clean and it doesn't create any volume. I feel it is not worth the money to buy, or to produce it."
3.00,"I purchased two of these to stock up due to these shampoos was discontinued but after continuous use my hair, scrap would get oily and have so much dandruffs like no other shampoos have done...I would not recommend this shampoo to anyone"
5.00,"pantene flat to volume is the only shampoo that actually gives you volume. been using it forever, thanks! ya got my loyalty ;)"
5.00,"The shampoo came quickly and I was relieved to be able to find it online. It may seem strange to buy shampoo online, but as a redhead who has been looking for this for the past few months (I guess there aren't enough of us to make it worthwhile to sell in stores anymore), I was grateful that I could get it."
5.00,"After using this product I noticed less dead ends, healthier hair and tighter curls. My hair is usual so frizzy and flat. Not after using this product :)"
4.00,"It's a great product. Keeps hair shiny."
5.00,"I'll begin by saying that I'm old enough to be retired and have color-treated hair, which puts me in the market niche for whom this shampoo was apparently developed. I've been using it for about a month now and can honestly say I love the stuff. I do use a styling gel with another label but have used it long enough to know that it wasn't the gel alone that restored the gloss, shine, and manageability to my hair. I'm still working and still like to be presentable to my students, which means the Pantene Agedefy shampoo is my new best friend in the shower stall. It is so effective I've even been able to reduce the amount of time I spend with my curling iron! I brush from crown to ear lobe with a nice twist at the cheek and--voila!--there it is: the kind of curl I had \"back in the day.\" I highly recommend this product."
4.00,"I have been using this shampoo for just under a month now and have found it to work almost as well as Bumble and Bumble curly hair products. My hair is extremely dark, thick, coarse, and brittle. So I needed a shampoo that wouldn't cause more harm. I am pleased to say that this shampoo did seem to cut down on frizz, although the results weren't immediate--I started to see an improvement after about 2 weeks of use (every other day). -1 Star because Pantene Products are tested on animals."
1.00,"It was worse than using Baby Shampoo on my hair, my hair didn't even feel clean after using it. My hair looked and felt greasy after it dried, I will never buy this product again. This was a total waste of money. I do not have a problem with oily hair(Being 46 yrs old), but this shampoo did not even clean my hair and left it greasy after using it, like it over conditioned my hair."
5.00,"I've been buying this shampoo for years. I love the convenience of a decent shampoo and conditioner in one step, and Amazon makes it so easy to get a good price and keep my closet stocked with their subscribe and save service."
5.00,"$13.98 for two bottles. Good value and saved me a trip to the local walmart. Ordered on Jan ist, received on Jan 12th."
3.00,"My wife has fine, dry hair that tends to be brittle and falls out if not treated properly. She already likes and uses Pantene hair products, so she tried this shampoo and its paired conditioner for one month. The result: she did not notice any difference from the \"regular\" Pantene products she was already using. She did say that it smells nice. Also, she mentioned that it performs as well as some more expensive 'salon' products she has used. And it does perform better than 'bargain' brands like Suave. So the conclusion is that if you currently use more expensive salon products for fine hair, try this Pantene duo for similar performance at a cheaper price. If you currently use a cheap brand of hair product, try Pantene and see if it works better for you. Otherwise, if you are happy with your current product/price, we see no compelling reason to switch."
5.00,"i started using this product last year hoping it could tame my wild mane and i was right. thank you pantene!!! now i have confidence to go outside w/o worrying. it helps my hair stay clean, and smooth, while keeping my curls in place. i would highly reccomend this to any1 who has curly hair troubles... now they are solved!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1"
1.00,"I bought this shampoo (and the matching conditioner) and the shampoo is horrible. It totally strips your hair of all natural oils and moisture leaving you with dry, brittle flat hair (even with using the conditioner). My hair was healthy when I started using this product and I'm only half way through the bottle and the texture of my hair is terrible and I'm getting split ends. The conditioner helps some, but the shampoo is just way too harsh on your hair. I won't be buying this shampoo again."
4.00,"Love Pantene products and this makes my hair feel really nice. It doesn't weigh it down or anything. I needed another product to reduce frizz."
5.00,"Pantene Pro-V Pyrithione Zinc 2 in 1 Anti-Dandruff Shampoo and Conditioner 12.6 fl oz is a terrific product.  The Pantene product helps my itchy scalp and leaves my hair soft and manageable. I cannot use Neutrogena T-Gel Shampoo as it causes a rash on my neck and face.  This Pantene shampoo &amp; conditioner works very well for me.  Try it and you will love it!  I am glad that Amazon offers this terrific product to its customers. I have ordered this product twice from Amazon and will reorder it again and again and again!"
4.00,"This is a nice, richly lathering timesaver that really does do two jobs: While smelling lovely, it cleans like a shampoo, gently enough for even color-treated or bleached hair, and it moisturizes like a conditioner, well enough to run fingers through even curly hair. Just keep in mind that for longer hair, a 2-in-1 isn't to be used on a regular basis but instead on a temporary or once-in-a-while basis. That being said, I love using this when I'm in a hurry, in the hospital, sick, traveling for a short amount of time or just want a quick hair washing at the kitchen sink when I don't need a full shower. However, if I use it for too long, my hair becomes frizzy and a little dry--not because this is a bad product but because no 2-in-1 is good for regular use, at least not on color-treated hair."
2.00,"NOTE that this review pertains to both Pantene Frizzy To Smooth shampoo AND Frizzy To Smooth conditioner. I have not tried the 2-in-1 shampoo/conditioner, and I do not think duplicate reviews are allowed on Amazon, so I will review only the shampoo.I'm a longtime user of Pantene's Smooth (formerly Smooth & Sleek) shampoo and conditioner. Over the years I've tested various other brands--Herbal Essences, TRESemme, Infusium 23, John Frieda, Dove, Aussie, Garnier Fructis, even the generic Wal-Mart version of Pantene Smooth--but none have ever come close to how, well, smooth and sleek Pantene made my hair. Imagine my confusion when I went to Wal-Mart to buy some more and found that Pantene had completely redone all their products so it took me two weeks just to figure out what had become of Pantene Smooth--now everything is based not on what look you want for your hair (which, IMO, was more intuitive and made more sense), but on your hair type, and my suspicions were confirmed when I saw a Pantene commercial celebrating the change of Pantene Smooth to Pantene Frizzy To Smooth (for medium-thick hair).Now, even Pantene can't top what Pantene had. Frizzy To Smooth has different ingredients (why couldn't they keep the same ingredients and just change the name and label, like they did before?) and is nowhere NEAR as good as the old Pantene Smooth. Whereas before my hair was smooth and sleek and shiny, now it feels like dry straw. No, it's not frizzy yet (despite 90-degree, high-humidity weather), but it's not exactly smooth (or sleek), either. I used to actually enjoy running my fingers through my Pantene-shiny hair and seeing how it glinted in the light; now all that is gone. What's up with that, Pantene?Why did Pantene have to go and fix--and break--something that wasn't broken to start with? I'm starting to think I'm going to have to begin testing other, probably more expensive brands again. I'm sure there are a few I've missed. I see Aveeno has a new shampoo out. I just never thought I'd have to find something better than Pantene, which, before now, HAD no better, affordable competitors available on the shelves.Way to go and ruin a perfectly good thing, Pantene."
5.00,"OF ALL THE PRODUCTS I'VE TRIED THIS IS WITHOUT A DOUBT THE MOST EFFICIENT TO KEEP HAIR CLEAN AND OIL FREE."
5.00,"This product is great, but if you want to try it, go to a RiteAid and buy one for a much better price than shown here.                                              I found out recently, that this product is no longer being made....which is probably why it sells at this price on Amazon. It used to be available for less than $5 in Rite-Aid, sometimes I bought 2 for $4 when it was on special. It was Pantene's best product in my opinion, but there is no point in trying something out that isn't going to be available very soon anyway. Heads and Shoulders products took its' place, but in my opinion they don't compare. It did leave my hair nice and soft and full of moisture. I will miss it, but will not pay this price."
5.00,"love this new product, my hair looks alot nicer and less frizzy ... style stays all day .... recommend it highly"
5.00,"I used this product and I feel like it protected my damaged hair so it did what it said would. What more can I say about it. Did what it said it would."
5.00,"This was for my daughter, she is a natural blonde and this help her maintain her natural blonde look. She swears by it."
4.00,"The product was what I buy in stores for greater quantity and a lower price. When I first open it, there was little bit of shampoo around the pump that leaked out. However, after I put it in my shower, it's always worked perfectly."
1.00,"This used to be a nice, relatively inexpensive shampoo with just the right amount of conditioning and a sweet, but unoffensive fragrance. Unfortunately, Proctor and Gamble decided to change all that. The most obvious difference is the fragrance. This is now yet another disgustingly sweet smelling shampoo, and for that alone, I wouldn't be able to buy it any more. Unfortunately, they also seem to have adjusted the formula a bit, turning up the conditioning more than I would like. I realize a lot of that comes down to preference, but because this was a silent update that significantly changed an existing product, I didn't find out about it until my large and infrequent subscribe and save order arrived. I definitely won't be buying more of this in the future, but I'm also stuck with several bottles of shampoo that I'm not likely to use."
5.00,"I have very thin hair and have never been able to get it to look like I wanted. With Pantene Pro Shampoo, my hair is now full and easy to manage. With only a blow dryer and the Thickening Treatment, I now love my hair and the way it looks. I feel like I have been to a shop and had my hair done. Love love love this new collection"
5.00,"I have always had very fine, flat hair that also requires frequent washings (every 2 days), this despite 42 years of coloring using a double process. I was very excited to see a new Pantene product. Since the 1970s (?) I have found this line of shampoos and conditioners not only gives me volume that looks like I have double the hair I actually have (you should see it tonight), but also improves the health of my hair, preventing and seemingly repairing breakage and split ends. I used to be plagued with split ends and now they are a thing of the past. I like this volumizing product because it enables me to do braids, thick ponytails and upswept styles with various accessories. My hair is also totally straight, so this product and other Pantene products have eliminated the need for a body perm. I will probably buy the product again. The only thing that has always bothered me is that Procter and Gamble insists on animal testing and I have six recued pet rats (often they are lab rats). I really wish they would stop this as their products are good and Pantene products are some of the best on the market."
5.00,"I GOT A SAMPLE OF THE AGE DEFYING SHAMPOO AND THE MASQUE, USED IT AND LOVED IT. BUT I CANNOT FIND IT WHERE DO YOU FIND IT?"
5.00,"Just a heads up, they have renamed and changed the look of this shampoo.Per the Pantene website as of August 8, 2013:\"Daily Moisture Renewal SHAMPOO - We've updated the name and look of your favorite anti-dandruff formula! The name and packaging have changed slightly, but you'll still get the trusted moisturized feel that Pantene delivers so well. \""
5.00,"I have dry hair, this shampoo is just not for color treated hair only.It really gives my hair a visible shine and moisture."
4.00,"This is a very basic shampoo with a great scent, I usually used salon shampoo. However the rest of my household used this one and they seem to love it."
3.00,"I liked this product a lot, it left my hair feeling really soft and moisturized but I prefer to use Pantene Pro-V Heat Shield shampoo and conditioner instead."
5.00,"always a great shampoo. don't need to use much and with a good price it is a real bargain. can use every day."
3.00,"Ok so here it is a review after using it for over few months: the first time I shampooed my hair: My hair instantly became tangle free and the smell was delicious. The shampoo is a nice texture that glides, you don't need to use too much. My hair are pretty long (or should i say were- as I have had them cute since using the shampoo), I have lots of hair they are just not that thick, so i purchased all set (including the serum- see my serum review), for maximum results. After shampooing my hair for the first time they felt great, i followed it on with a conditioner. Conditioner: this is a very thick conditioner- again it smells beautiful- not very strong a bit flowery- reminds me a slight smell of baby shampoo. Again I didn't have to use a lot, try not to use this on your roots but rather the length of your hair only. After washing my hair my hair actually felt great, they looked and felt very soft to touch. I followed this with the serum (see review) OK so after using it few times my hair felt great and I received compliments from my co worker who noticed my hair slightly thicker (joys of having a baby!) BUT..... Conclusion after using it for more than a month: The shampoo and conditioner seemed to have stopped working, it started to dry my hair out (considering I started to let my hair dry naturally and didn't use hair iron), it felt straw-ish like and :O i Started getting split ends. I would recommend this shampoo and conditioner ONLY for people who 1) have not colored their hair and 2) who have oily hair or dry hair and use other products to keep your hair less frizzy. This shampoo and conditioner seemed to do its magic for few washes and then stopped working- I started to lose more hair- so no it didn't thicken my hair (Irony!) My journey for perfect shampoo and conditioner continues :("
5.00,"MY REVISED REVIEW... Read if you want to find the new Shampoo and Conditioner that is the same ingredients as the old product formulas! Pantene is trying to say the Shine Enhance CONDITIONER is like the Old Restorative Time Renewal CONDITIONER. IT IS NOT. If you are looking for the old formula then you need to buy the Pantene Pro-V Restore Beautiful Lengths FRIZZ CONTROL CONDITIONER. I had the tube from the old formula and found the ingredients in that and the ingredients in the Frizz Control Conditioner ARE THE SAME. I tried to email and call Pantene but they obviously don't know their own products and continue to give inaccurate information. AS FOR THE OLD FORMULA SHAMPOO: If you want the Old formula Restorative Time Renewal Shampoo then you will want to buy the NEW BEAUTIFUL LENGTHS SHINE ENHANCE SHAMPOO. I am trying to help because many of my family members and I used the old formula and were worried when they changed things. I have compared the ingredients and no matter what Pantene customer service tells you....these products I listed are the actual replacements. Try them you will see. MY OLD REVIEW: One of the best shampoo you will ever use for damaged hair. I am a professional stylist and have not found any line that works like Pantene Restoratives Time Renewal. Pantene has stopped making many of their products. What a shame. They said consumers were confused by all the choices. Call and complain. Their products were superior and did what they claimed. IF IT AIN'T BROKE DON'T FIX IT!"
5.00,"I bought this shampoo the ending of last month, because I got the news the price was 2 for $3.5. I just recieved this morning, it is great!!!!!"
5.00,"How nice this is.The lather was so rich and creamy.I used too much the first time.You really do not need too much.Love this and will buy again"
5.00,"I am using another product daily (for another reason) that was fading my color, making my hair look grey. Using this shampoo has restored the color and I can use a permanent color every six/seven weeks as I did previously.."
4.00,"This shampoo is great. I have just enough curl in my hair that it tends to frizz a little. Just used this shampoo for the 1st time and no frizz! Pantene Pro-V Nature Fusion Shampoo, Moisture Balance, 25.4-Ounce (Pack of 2)"
5.00,"I recently received a free sample in the mail and immediately tried it because lately I've been having a difficult time finding a product that would do my hair any justice and I absolutely fell in love.. Pantene made my curls bouncy again and quite defined and my hair had more flow. To top it off it smells amazing and it's has perfect texture and consistency. It didn't weight my hair down at all and my hair had just the right amount of volume.. It's just an awesome product all around and definitely switching over to a new and much more pleasurable shampoo and conditioner for my everyday.. Thank You Pantene!!"
1.00,"I was very disappointed with the new line of Pantene products. I preferred the 2008 hydrating curls shampoo it left my hair feeling smooth, frizz free, and managable! I have been using Pantene for about 15 years and was very disappointed as the new curl shampoo leaves my hair feeling greesy, tangled, and dry. I hope that you truly value your customer's feedback and will re-launche athrow-back's line featuring all the shampoos that were available in 2008!! After reading multiple reviews your customer's are extremely dissatisfied. I don't know if Pantene has been using less-costly ingredients but I am not impressed. Hoping there is a turn around for my semi-straight, frizzy, colored hair!!"
5.00,"Wife uses this particular shampoo and conditioner separate and I liked it so bought the combo. The two in one products have never made sense to me. Think about it, If the conditioner molecules hit the hair before the shampoo the whole purpose is lost. :) But of course like any man the idea of getting it done quickly with least amount of cycles overpowered normal sense to separate shampoo and conditioning. It works well though."
3.00,"The one thing I will say for this product is that it smells AMAZING and the fragrance really stays in my hair all day."
1.00,"Whatever you do....do NOT buy from America Rx. They sent me the wrong product and when I called to ask for a refund they actually tried to barter with me. I can give you a dollar right now....how bout 3 dollars??? The customer service is in India and I felt so disconnected to the actual company. My friend had the EXACT same problem so this is obviously not a one time occurance. Total SCAM ARTISTS. I can't believe Amazon would do business with companies like this. This is the 3rd order messed up in the past few months...and all through second parties. I think Amazon should stop doing business this way. It really destroys their reputation."
5.00,"I've been looking for Pantene Pro-V clarifying shampoo in stores and had no luck. Amazon.com had it though! Works great really cleans your hair and leaves it shiny and smelling great!"
5.00,"I am a long term user of Pantene, I had course stubborn hair and pantene did a wonderful job of softening it so when a friend told me she wanted shampoo for Christmas and she has very curly hair I said Bingo, Pantene it is."
4.00,"Use this as alternative to my regular shampoo. Find it a little drying. My hair looks its best on the second day rather than the first day after shampooing. My hair is fine with a bit of wild curl - this shampoo makes it fuzzy."
4.00,"When they shipped this they didn't tape the lid closed on the bottle. I opened the package to a plastic bag full of shampoo. What's up with that?"
5.00,"I'm 53 and my hair has lost most of it's shine. Although I color it, I use red and that's not the most reflective color. This shampoo & conditioner is AMAZING! Everytime I use it I have great shine that lasts til the next wash, which is usually every other day! Highly recommend!!!"
4.00,"This is a nice product--it's thick, smells good, leaves my hair soft and clean, lathers easily, and doesn't require (at least for me) a separate conditioner. I don't see much to the name Age Defy--talk about hype. I think there's way too much emphasis on looking/staying young these days. I can't imagine a shampoo being a life saver. This shampoo, like most others has lots of artificial chemicals--whether this is important probably depends on the user. Mostly, since I travel quite a bit and stay in hotels, I use lots of hotel shampoos. They work fine in general. This one seems to leave my hair a bit better than they do, but then I've got to pay for another one. Thankfully, Amazon Vine provides test products for free. Great idea! So, I like this product, but I liked a previous one I got from Vine even better. Motions Shampoo, Lavish Conditioning, Medium to Coarse Hair, 13 oz."
5.00,"Item is exactly as described. It was packaged very well, and arrived very quickly. Thanks for a pleasant shopping experience."
1.00,"What they ship is not as shown in the picture. It's the same Classic I can buy anywhere, not the original Classic Clean. I feel mislead. Will be returning."
5.00,"A must have for thin and straight hair. It's excellent for its price, it has a great fragance and my hair looks and feels healthier"
5.00,"I have used Targent, which is very good but can't be used everyday. Pantene is inexpensive and great for everyday use."
4.00,"So I usually use the Pantene Ice Shine line, but I saw the claims on this bottle and my interest was piqued. It claims to offer 10 solutions for your hair. I will list the 10 \"solutions\" and how I feel the shampoo delivers on each promise. 1. Repair for rough hair - I'm still not sure on this one. I wouldn't say it \"repaired\" my hair. It does feel smooth but they mention that later. So basically they are kind of getting credit for the same thing twice. 2. strength against damage - I'm not sure. I think I will have to use this a while to see. 3. silky softness - I totally agree on this. While lathering my hair in the shower it felt like an explosion of silky goodness. After drying, my hair still feels really soft!! 4. brilliant shine - Ehhhh maybe. My hair is smoother so it may look a little shinier, but I would not say \"brilliant\" shine 5. smoothing - Yes. My hair is smoother, but isn't that kind of the same thing as manageable and detangled which are also mentioned?? Again, a repetitive \"solution\". 6. moisture- Well it certainly feels softer so I guess it has more moisture. 7. frizz control- Yes. I would have to say there is a little less frizz than usual. 8. gentle cleaning- Yes. My hair feels really clean without feeling \"stripped\" like it can after other shampoos. 9. manageability- Yes. But I think that kind of goes along with number 10 below. It is more manageable because it is softer, and detangled. 10.detangling - Absolutely. I have thick hair and it usually is a rats nest when shampooing in the shower. This stuff helped my fingers just glide through my hair while lathering. Even now that's it dry I can run my fingers through it with no snags---that's new for me!! So overall I like this shampoo. It does do a lot of what it said it would. I would also like to try the matching conditioner to go with this. That might bump up it's performance a bit as well. Since it is the same price as the Ice Shine and I do like it a little better, I will probably start using this kind from now on. ."
5.00,"Best shampoo and conditioners I have used. My hair is much silkier, feels in much better condition and yet not weighed down with heavy oils. I have fine hair (color treated and several gray hairs) and love this product!"
5.00,"Pantene silver expressions gives my hair just the right amount of silver and shine. It also gives body to my fine hair. I get a lot of compliments now that I have found this product at Amazon. It is no longer carried in any of the stores in my town, so I am grateful for free shipping."
5.00,"I have very fine, flat hair and this is the reason I wanted to try this particular product. I have done several hair washes so I could get an idea if the product really worked and I am happy to say it does. It did give my hair a bit more volume and I am satisfied with that. I wasn't expecting a miracle and did not get one. It worked well enough for me to continue using it because my hair can use any help it can get."
5.00,"I have been using the shampoo for around a month and have enjoyed the results. I am salt and pepper hair, and it is keeping the yellow out."
1.00,"This product (like all Pantene products) is awful. My boyfriend used to use it because he liked the smell, and I finally had to take it away and buy some good stuff for him. An hour after he got out of the shower, his hair was greasy, and by the end of the day, it was beyond disgusting. He also started to get really bad dandruff. After looking at the ingredients and realizing this shampoo is full of harsh sulfates and wax, I immediately threw it out. He hasn't had a problem since. Don't buy this shampoo!"
5.00,"I received a free sample (which I requested), and was quite surprised that my hair actually showed a difference. I am a die-hard John Frieda user and didn't think there was a better product out there. I am a 54 year old woman and I home and salon dye my hair. I already have very nice hair for my age and product usage. It looks quite youthful (we won't address my other issues, lol) and I often get compliments on it. This product made my hair very pleasant to style and it is exceptionally shiny. Thank you for the product sample and opportunity to share my experience!"
5.00,"i love how my hair feels and smells from my panteen pro-v! i am so glad i bought it. i look forward to washing my hair now!"
5.00,"I have sort of a funky situation with my hair- I live in Southwest Florida, where it's hot and humid constantly, so my wavy hair can get both frizzy *and* easily weighed down by sweat and the gross weather. However I'm a distance swimmer (in chlorinated water or salt water at least two hours every day) so right after I get back from swimming it's dry as hay and frizzy. So I need a shampoo that not only gets the chemicals out from the pool, but doesn't strip my hair in the process OR weight it down with any sort of oils/residue.                                                                     It's a hard compromise. I've always used                                                and it's been great, but I think that it built up on my hair because for the last few weeks it's been looking limp and dull.                                                                     So yesterday, while at the local Big Box store (the one with the red logo), I picked up a bottle of the Pantene Aqua Light just to see if switching shampoos might clean off any residue or any chemicals/oils that might have built up on my hair in the last few weeks. I washed it twice with the Pantene.                                                                     I have to say, there's an IMMEDIATE improvement. My hair is light and shiny and bouncy again. When I washed it, I liked that it felt not only squeaky clean, but not super dry. It easily combed out after the shower.                                                                     I'm pretty excited, to be honest. I'll probably use the Pantene for a while, switch back to the Dove, and then alternate. But this is a great shampoo for people with \"moody\" hair like mine- gentle, but strong, too. It gets the chemicals out without making my hair into hay, and it prevents my hair from looking like a lifeless mop by the end of the day, no matter how high the heat and humidity.                                                                     Highly recommend. (It smells great, too!)"
5.00,"I love this shampoo! It is great for women with long hair who workout and wash their hair every day."
3.00,"I'm not a big fan of 2-n-1 products, They clean hair fine but the conditioner part is lacking. I like a separate conditioner I can leave in a minute. It's a fine shampoo but a less successful conditioner."
5.00,"I have been using Blonde Expressions shampoo & conditioner for over a year and I want to say, I have never found products that have been so great for my hair. They make it so soft & shiny, yet still manageable. I have told all my friends about these products. My friends who are not blondes have bought the products for their hair color & have been just as pleased as I have been. I just want to ask that you not change this or \"improve\" it or discontinue it. It's perfect the way it is."
4.00,"Like many of the customers who have left reviews here, I was so upset when Pantene stopped making Silver Expressions. I guess all those cards and letters we sent them must have worked because it's BACK! I have tried other products that claimed to bring out the shine in silver hair, but nothing works like this product. I am PROUD of my almost totally silver hair and will never color it again, but I still want my wild curls to be beautiful! I started getting compliments once again on my bright silver hair when I started using Pantene Silver Expressions again. I couldn't be happier!"
4.00,"i love these products i bought the bundle the shampoo,conditioner,and the mousse. but i didn't buy this for me i bought this for my daughter she's 3 and has been using it since she was 2 and just before she turned 1 her hair started to curl and now she has really curly hair so i guess she's nautraly curly. when she wakes up her hair is a mess and really frizzy when i use these products her hair looks so pretty and curly and doesn't have any more frizz i dont use the mousse much just with the shampoo and conditioner and looks good so if u have curly hair i recommend you use this product."
1.00,"I used the pantene keratin products on my light blonde hair and now my hair is a carmel color. The same thing happened to my sister's hair. We both used it for the first time today and can't believe how much darker our blonde hair is. I AM VERY UPSET."
5.00,"I've tried several other brands of shampoo, including more expensive so-called premium brands and have not found something better than this Pantene shampoo for the price. Most of the other ones dried out my hair (or at least made my hair feel more dry).The thing I like about this Pantene is that it has a conditioner built in so I only use a separate conditioner a couple times a week and that works out well."
5.00,"I am a natural blonde. But I have a lot of gray hair coming in so I dye my hair with non-permanent hair color. I mix my own shade of blonde using Clairol Natural Instincts. The Natural Instincts shades tend to go a bit yellow on me, which I don't like. This shampoo helps. It's a nice clarifying shampoo that works well on both grey & blonde hair color. It has a blue tint to it which neutralizes yellow. I love it!"
4.00,"I'm a middle aged woman who has never dyed or permed my hair, so I didn't have a problem with damaged hair, but I did want help keeping down the frizz. This shampoo definitely minimizes the frizz after a shampoo, leaving it shinier and more manageable. However I've been using bargain brands my whole life, so for everyday, in light of this shampoo's hefty price tag, I think I will continue to use shampoos that are more economical. For special occasions, though, when I want every hair in place, this would be worth the investment to me."
5.00,"I had used this shampoo for quite few years; suddenly, for some unknown reason, it disappear out of the retailers I used to buy it from. Walgreens, CVS, Rite Aid etc. For some reason they stop carrying it. I love the fact that I found it in Amazon and for a lower price that I was accustomed to pay for."
5.00,"I bought this is the Pantene Relaxed &amp; Natural Shampoo and Conditioner after I put this in my hair to blow dry, my hair is soft and strong. I absolutely love it and now I am stuck with it."
5.00,"Everyone should strip their hair often to remove silicone and other chemicals that build-up in your hair. This shampoo as it says is silicone free and it will strip your hair of those bad chemicals!!!"
2.00,"Not only did this dull the shine of silver hair, but it also transformed the natural curls into a frizzy lifeless looking mess. Usually when we don't like human cleaning products, we turn them into shower cleaning products, but this is intensely colored so will likely not work to keep a shower looking white."
5.00,"I have a full head of silver- this is my favorite shampoo- no yellow at all. Don't be put off by the color- it works exceptionally well!"
5.00,"Been using this formula for a few months now and I have to say, I don't need anything else to work with. This is fabulous. I have hair down to my backside, so with hair that long, you have to really take care of it. This has not only improved my hair, but it is actually like \"new hair\" all the way to the ends. Even the ends are shiny and no spit ends from using this regularly. I especially love the Age Defy conditioner. It has worked wonders for me. My hair, when short is very curly. Long, it's straight. This formula brought back body and curl to mine. No frizz and no breakage. Highly recommend for long hair."
2.00,"I have baby fine hair and tons of it. For my hair type this product is too heavy and bulky. I'm not a fan of \"creamy\" shampoos. I prefer the clear kind. This shampoo doesn't work for me."
5.00,"Two adults, one male and one female, used it for a few weeks and had pretty much the same reactions. -it cleans nicely: one application is fine except for extreme conditions (say after a game of competitive sports) -it rinses clean and easily--no residue, no lengthy rinsing needed - works fine on fine, thin (OK, thinning) hair (can't speak much to the \"volumizing\" aspect)--certainly left the hair light and not at all flat - works fine on dyed thicker hair -left hair feeling soft and fine even without conditioner - a slight pleasant scent but nothing too strong We switched to Pantene years ago and are often reminded why when forced to use other shampoos while traveling (we keep Pantene stocked at the site we visit most). This is another quality product. recommended"
4.00,"I live in South Louisiana, and June is quite possibly the most humid time of the year for us - the humidity levels are off the charts! To start, I like this shampoo, it has a great lather and a nice smell - it's similar to all of the other shampoos in the Pantene line. One thing to especially note is that this shampoo definitely weighs your hair down, which is great for humid areas, my hair doesn't frizz up the moment I walk outside, but I also feel like it's a little \"too\" heavy....Almost looks like I didn't wash it. My hair is medium to thick texture, some natural curl to it, and frizzes up instantly in humid weather - the shampoo does what it says, it really is a hair solution for frizzy hair, but it does have a con - it weighs my hair down just a bit too much."
4.00,"This product is great and two for the bargain price really makes it a very good bargain for everyone out there."
5.00,"At this price point, this is one of the best volumizing shampoos, great quality and very mild scent. highly reomended."
5.00,"This shampoo is the first one that actually doesn't dull hair color. My hair is shiny from one coloring to another!"
1.00,"For many years I've been using Pantene Clarifying formula. When I couldn't find the Clarifying formula anymore, I decided to try Pantene Classic. While the Clarifying formulas was a clear liquid, the Classic shampoo is a milky white creamlike formula. In comparison between the two products, the Classic is horrible. The first thing I noticed when using Classic was the lack of a rich lather and a deep cleaning feeling. After a second application of the shampoo, the lather generated was initially a little more but then quickly disappeared after vigorous scrubbing. After rinsing, there was definitely no squeaky clean feeling but instead a sort of a silky but slimy feel in my hair. I also had to pour out much more Classic shampoo than the Clarifying shampoo in order to clean my hair. With a tiny bit of Clarifying shampoo I can produce a lot more lather and get my hair squeaky clean without the slimy feeling in my hair. Classic is terrible."
5.00,"One of the first things you'll notice about this product--and all Pantene products--is that you only need to use a very small amount. In this case, just a small squeeze yields lots of suds. Your hair will feel clean and look healthy after shampooing, too. This is the only product I'll use on my hair. I've tried many other shampoos and conditioners over the years, but Pantene makes my hair look its best. One thing to keep in mind, though, is that most people will need to use a conditioner after shampooing. If I didn't, I'd never be able to comb through my wet hair."
5.00,"This shampoo has a creamier texture than most and leaves your hair feeling clean. It leaves the hair feeling and looking good. It is certainly an excellent choice."
4.00,"I have gray hair and have been using it for sometime.. I think it keeps my hair brighter and I like the texture it leave me with. All in all I think it is a good product."
5.00,"Great product. I just wish I could find it locally. All of the stores I have recently checked claim that they cannot get the product___that it must have been discontinued. I called Pantene & they claim otherwise."
5.00,"We took advantage of this exceptional product and bundle price to stock up for college!"
1.00,"This is a poor replacement for the shampoo I have used for years. I have used the Blonde for Hunnysucker to Platnum for years and this does not measure up. It leave my hair flat instead of fluffy and takes twice as long to dry."
5.00,"I am in love with the shampoo and conditioner. It makes my hair look smooth and revitalized. Its great for hair over 40 for men and women."
5.00,"I've been using this shampoo every day for a week and am very impressed with it. For an unassuming non-specialty brand, it delivers excellent cleaning properties and better performance than many of the specialized brands I've tried. My scalp is very sensitive and I have a hard time finding shampoo that does not leave my scalp dry and itchy. This Pantene Pro-V leaves my hair feeling clean and does not dry out my scalp like many other brands, even ones that claim to be moisturizing. It is clear with no FD&C dyes, pleasantly-scented (floral) and produces a thick, sastifying lather. I am a male with short-medium length hair. A dollop the size of a quarter is all I needed to work into a rich foam that covers my entire head. One bottle should last me more than 6 months at this rate, making this product an excellent value. Highly recommended."
5.00,"I have been using 2 in 1 shampoo and conditioners since its easier and i guess cheaper that way. The price that this was sold for was way cheaper then the stores here. Really works great for my hair. Cleans and has a good bubble action. Hair feels great, buy it."
4.00,"It doesn't weigh my hair down and is lightweight.I also like the smell and feel it is a good product."
4.00,"Apparently Pantene is no longer selling this shampoo. Since I love it, I was happy to find some at Amazon."
5.00,"I've been testing the Pantene Expert Collection Pro-V AgeDefy Shampoo for weeks and have to rate it highly. I think it does a fine job in controlling dandruff, even though that's not listed as one of its features. Designed for treating aging hair, I think this is a shampoo that should appeal to users of all ages. What it claims it does do is to reduce breakage, prevent split ends, tames frizz, controls unruly grays, minimizes lackluster color, minimizes the look of thinning and minimizes dryness. I can only attest to its usefulness in minimizing dryness; its other attributes may require further weeks of testing. It can be used with or without the accompanying Pantene Expert Collection Pro-V AgeDefy Conditioner."
4.00,"I've recently decided to stop coloring my hair and let the grey grow in. Regular shampoos left me with coarse hair and an uneven color. This shampoo gives me soft, manageable beautiful grey and brown hair. I've not used any other brand but this is very affordable and I highly recommend it."
1.00,"I bought the trio of products offered here in Canada. I faithfully used them and after two weeks had a huge hair loss. During one shampoo-conditioner session about 20% of my hair came out. I had I was hoping my hair of average fullness would begin to appear fuller, the exact opposite happened. I stopped using it immediately. Sorry Pantene, wish I could give you a glowing recommendation."
1.00,"I bought this shampoo hoping for some volume. Instead I got the opposite. It made my fine, fly-away hair even flatter and more fly-away. I guess I will have to keep looking. I will not finish the bottle I have and definitely won't buy it again."
5.00,"I am a lazy person. I always look for 2 in 1 shampoo. Although not all Pantene Pro V hair products are working for me, this 2 in 1 works very well. It feel clean and smooth, no sticky residue on my hair, no slimy conditioner or greasy feeling. I stop seeing Target carrying it. I will definitely buy another one if I see it again"
5.00,"I bought this because I'd already washed my hair three times due to heavy buildup and it still had white specks; When I saw this, I thought I'd give it a try since I'd used pantene when I was relaxed for many years. It lathered up well, nice smell, and I didn't have any more white specks!"
5.00,"I have been using nexus pro mend for three years and have always loved it but my hair still seemed to be dry, tangled, and shedding. I came across pantene expert with keratin repair a few weeks ago up in college. I usually stay away from pantene because I've been told by my hair dresser it strips the natural minerals and oils from your hair... I was amazed!! After the first shampoo and conditioning I put the split end fuser in and blew out my hair. It dried faster than normal and was brighter and shinier. Not only did it smell great but it also made my hair so soft and usually my hair gets knotty. I cant stop putting my hands thru it, best shampoo and conditioning combo ever."
5.00,"This makes my hair so soft!! I have very curly hair that has been so dry this winter and this, along with the conditioner, has helped more than anything else I have tried."
3.00,"I'm guessing like most guys here, I've used a lot of different shampoos in my life. I spent about a decade recently using Suave shampoos because they're cheap, I liked the smell, they clean well, and I'm a guy...I mentioned they were cheap, right? Well, they worked just fine. A while back, I was able to try Pantene's \"Volume\" shampoo as part of the Vine program. I liked it so much that I switched to it and have used it ever since. I doesn't make my hair look \"fuller,\" but it's not that expensive and cleans well.This product from Dove does smell good - I'm not sure what a \"manly\" scent is, but I know when I smell it, and this has one. So, thumbs up. It also cleans fine. If it was the only shampoo available, I'd have no issues at all using it. However, it doesn't seem to rinse away as fully as the Pantene does. When my hair is dry, it feels fine - but it just feels like it's not all washing off when I'm in the shower. At first, I thought that maybe it was coating my hair to make it fuller, but it doesn't make my hair look any different than the Pantene does. At least one person has noted that it rinses with no residue, so either I'm imagining or perhaps my water is softer than his.Rinsing issues aside, I just like Pantene's product better - and it's about 50% less expensive per ounce than this Dove shampoo. So, while this shampoo is fine and smells good, I recommend trying the Pantene Volume product and comparing for yourself."
2.00,"I got this thinking that since it was a 2 in 1 it would be more moisturizing than the shampoo alone, but it felt pretty much the same as regular shampoo."
1.00,"bad! was a user of Pantene's Smooth (formerly Smooth & Sleek) shampoo. Frizzy To Smooth is nowhere NEAR as good as the old Pantene Smooth. Whereas before my hair was smooth and sleek and shiny, now it feels dry. It used to be shiny now that is gone."
5.00,"My family use this product and the conditioner regularly, we are very happy with it and would recommend it to anyone."
1.00,"I purchased this product with the high hopes that its high price would translate into great performance. I have been looking for a replacement for the old Infusium Repairology shampoo and conditioner which were the best products hands down. I saw the new Pantene Expert Collection products displayed on an end-cap at Walmart and chose the Keratin formula after reviewing the labels for both it and the age defy and decided that the Keratin formula might meet my haircare needs better and may actually be similar to the old Infusium. I am a guy with coarse hair that is cut short. I also use ordinary shampoo and conditioner on my thick, full beard. This product has a bland, forgettable fragrance. The shampoo is an odd caramel color and is gelatinous and does not dispense particularly easily out of the hard bottle. Performance of the shampoo was completely unremarkable, particularly in light of the product's $7.99 price for 10.1 oz. It does not feel luxurious during use, and it left my hair dry feeling. I was expecting a \"wow\" experience but was left completely underwhelmed. The conditioner comes in the familiar Pantene tube and dispenses easily through a small opening, but again I was left completely disappointed. It did not feel luxurious during use and left my hair feeling dry and unconditioned. There are other regular versions of Pantene that are far superior, including the Aqua Light formula. The Herbal Essences blue moisturizing formula is way, way better, and even some of the Head and Shoulders 2-1 formulas feel great on your hair. I was so frustrated this morning with this product that I actually squeezed the rest of the bottle and tube (about half) down the drain in anger I was so mad. I did not want to have to face that product in the shower again. I don't know if the Age Defy formula of this product is any better, but I am not inclined to sink another $16.00 into finding out. P&G is constantly reformulating all of its products (including soaps, detergents, etc.) but some its efforts fail. I predict this high end version of Pantene will languish and eventually go away. I am curious to see if anyone else likes this product."
1.00,"I'm generally a fan of Pantene hair products, so I got really excited by the promise of a Pantene shampoo and conditioner that was really lightweight, because I have very fine straight hair that gets weighed down with a lot of the shampoos/conditioners out there. Well, what I didn't realize was that weightlessness is earned by giving up the silicone in the shampoo, which means you also give up the shine. My hair was left very dull, it didn't smell as nice as other Pantene products and it was harder to brush. In fact, the effect on my hair was so bad, I just stopped using it, which I hate to do because I don't like to waste things. I'll donate the other bottle to our shelter, but I wouldn't recommend this product if you don't want to give up having your hair look shiny and healthy."
5.00,"This Shampoo helps define curls and smells great! Please don't stop making it!"
4.00,"The original clarifying shampoo was absolutely excellent and I can't find it any more. I've tried several other brands since then and none worked for me. This new Pantene Pro-V Clarifying shampoo is better than the others on the market."
5.00,"Smells so good and makes hair shiny and easy to comb through and shape. Thank you!"
4.00,"This is a thick shampoo that does a great job on my hair. I have to get used to not having to apply a second washing since it removes the grease and sweat from my hair with just one application. Afterwards, my hair is very lively and full."
1.00,"When I went to the store to purchase another Moisture Renewal it wasn't there. On the shelf now are 2in1 choices that don't just add moisture. I have thick, naturally curly hair and loved Moisture Renewal. It only added moisture to my hair. Felt great & looked great. The new Dry to Moisture leaves my hair weighted down with too much oil. It feels as though I need to wash my hair, like it's dirty. It also took my hair a very long time to dry using this. Please, please, Pantene, bring back the original Moisture Renewal. If it ain't broke, don't fix it. Until then I will have to try another brand."
5.00,"It washes my hair. So its good. I do not know why do I have to write a review about it. Its good and I recommend every one to get this."
5.00,"It does what is says it does. I have recommended these products to anyone looking for a shampoo that serves black hair both natural, transitioning and relaxed. It's a good buy."
4.00,"I have very baby-fine hair with little body. I used this shampoo for a week to see how it would hold up in all sorts of weather. It is nice and creamy with a great scent. Rinsed off clean with no residue as some volumizing shampoos will do. My hair felt softer and held a curl a bit better than normal. The one downfall was during very humid weather, when it didn't really seem to make a difference. (nothing does!) My husband also used it and really liked the clean feeling he had after using it as well. The scent wasn't too girlie either."
5.00,"The product is wonderful, however to date I have not received the item purchased on 09/15/2010.                                                                     Thanks"
1.00,"Having used Pantene products in the past, I purchased the new Pantene ProV Frizzy to Smooth shampoo and conditioners. After one use, my scalp was itchy but after a second bout, my scalp, ears and face where the hair touched the skin was itchy and burning horribly. I contacted the company by email and phone and was blown off, told to hold onto the products and heard no more. Whatever they are putting into their products is very harsh and they don't want to know about it. Buyer beware."
5.00,"I've been looking for cheaper shampoo than what I was using and the lady who cuts my hair suggested Pantene. I've been Beautiful Lengths for quite a while now, and it's actually better than the organic shampoo I was using. I've recieved so many more compliments for my hair since using it. I have long, 3A medium-textured hair and ~*lots*~ of it. My thought is that Beautiful Lengths will probably work better for people with my hair type rather than for people with baby-fine hair."
5.00,"Cleans what little hair I have just fine and is cheap. All I really want in a shampoo. Lather, rinse, don't repeat."
5.00,"The product has not been opened yet but I trust everything is fine since it is sealed in a package."
3.00,"The product might be good, but with the pump mechanism not functioning and broken on arrival, it is a pain to get out. When I feel like scooping it out with a qtip, I do like how well it applies and moisturizes"
4.00,"Great product and cleans well. I wish it left the hair smelling of a little more clean fragrance, but its still good. Shampoos/Conditioner seem so over priced, i would only recommend if you find a deal on it. If you're happy with the price, you'll be happy with the product."
3.00,"I normally use this same brand and type of shampoo, but with the shampoo and conditioner separate. It's been a week now using this and I can definitely tell that my hair is drier than it was before I switched, but it isn't affecting the skin on my scalp. It seems to hold the color in my hair just as well, but I need the conditioner to be separate. I'll be switching back to my old routine without finishing this bottle."
2.00,"This shampoo did not make my hair smooth. It made it worse and I stopped using it. Not a good product from Pantene."
5.00,"Very good shampoo, and my hair doesn't get dirty as fast as with other products. Fairly gentle, too. I recommend this shampoo."
4.00,"As far as the \"specialty\" style hair care products go, this one isn't too crazily priced, although it's obviously several dollars more than the cheap store brands. After using Pantene's \"Age Defy\" for a few weeks I can report has had a positive effect, and I'm experiencing much less frizz than normal with my hair.As far as the smell goes, it's actually quite pleasant without going overboard like the dollar shampoos with scents like \"Mandarin Breeze\" or whatever. You shouldn't expect to go from full-gray back to dark brunette, but it's definitely worth trying if the standard shampoo options aren't giving you the shine or frizz-free look you want."
5.00,"I've tried other products for gray hair and none even came close to comparing with this one. Sad to say, I cannot find it for sale in any of the stores in our area, so I had to resort to purchasing it through Amazon. It leaves my hair soft when dry and very easy to comb through when wet- no tangles (as opposed to a similar product for gray hair which shall remain nameless). Silver Expressions also enhances the 'silver' highlights in my hair. I highly recommend this shampoo."
5.00,"This is one of the few shampoos that work well with oily hair.  It is frustrating that nearly all shampoos in the store are for every condition except oily hair.  I am thankful that this shampoo is available online since the stores pulled it from the shelves.  It is worth the money to pay for this shampoo to be shipped because it works better than what's on the shelves and in salons."
5.00,"I have a very oily scalp that needs to be shampooed daily and wanted a clarifying shampoo. My hair and scalp feel very clean using this shampoo and the extra shiny hair is a plus. The only thing is that this makes my roots look so shiny it by default looks oily to me even though it's clean. If you have dull hair or just want it to feel extra clean I would definitely try this. The conditioner is even better."
5.00,"This shampoo is by far my favorite. It smells amazing and the smell lasts all day. It leaves my hair feeling smooth and silky. My hair is thin and I have a lot of split ends. I see a huge difference since I started using it. My hair is fuller, shinier, and overall much healthier and manageable. HIGHLY recommend."
5.00,"I am a life-long Pantene Pro-V user, but this weightless formula has done wonders for my hair. Will be sticking with this one for a while now!"
5.00,"dude.. thi sis awsome. I guess it is expensive for 2. 6 bucks a pop. However, it's huge! I'm going to use this for a logn time. Smells delicious!"
4.00,"This shampoo does not leave my hair perfectly \"frizz free,\" but it does seem to be a better start to the \"defrizzing\" ritual than others I have tried. I was able to use it with its companion conditioner, and it does leave my hair smooth and soft. Unfortunately, it does not leave it entirely frizz-free. If I air-dry my hair, by the time it is dry, it does have noticeable fly aways. If I finish the ritual with a \"defrizzing\" shine product or mousse, starting with this shampoo and conditioner does allow the shine products or mousse to do their jobs. (On my hair, without the Pantene Solutions shampoo and conditioner, neither mousse nor a defrizz shiner can control my hair's frizz completely.) This is good shampoo, as one would expect from Pantene. It is a little thicker than some of their other shampoos, and it does seem to help a bit in the frizz taming. Don't count on this shampoo alone to solve your frizz problems, but it can be a good first step."
4.00,"This shampoo lathers well and has a clean scent. I read somewhere that it smells similar to the original classic scent of old-school Pantene. I'm not sure how closely it matches that, but it DOES smell good."
5.00,"After my hairdresser destroyed my hair I was in tears! My hair had been breaking off for 4 weeks and I was devastated. I found this shampoo at target and from the second time using it I've noticed my hair is doing so much better. i seriously LOVE LOVE LOVE this product. I never review products but I had to write one for this. AMAZING!!!!!"
2.00,"I have straight un-treated hair that is hardly ever styled or blow dried, so I'm not particularly picky about what type of shampoo or conditioner I use. However, like some other reviewers have stated, this stuff leaves a heavy residue in my hair that I've never experienced with any other shampoo. Luckily I had a different shampoo on hand to re-wash my hair, and it got rid of the residue. I definitely do not recommend this line of Pantene, although I've used their other lines with no problems. I give the shampoo 2 stars because I really love the scent of this particular line, and I like that they support the Beautiful Lengths program."
5.00,"I have not always been a fan of Pantene products -- but this one changed my mind. First: it smells great - fresh, clean and not overly perfumed. Second: great bubbly, lather that rinsed cleanly. I have naturally curly hair, which tends to be dry. This shampoo left my hair moisturized, but not weighted down. I was impressed with how soft, managable my hair is and I think it tamed frizzies pretty well."
4.00,"I have been using this Shampoo/Conditioner for a year or so and have really enjoyed it. I ALWAYS flat iron my hair so, I have alot of damage. Of course, like with most hair products, it worked better in the beginning but, that would be my only complaint!"
5.00,"I had a lot of product on my 4b hair. With this shampoo, I only needed to shampoo once. My hair was clean and not stripped. The lather was like velvet on my scalp. When I rinsed it out, I could see my beautiful curls. I didn't think anything could replace my Moisture Renewal, but you done good with this one!"
5.00,"Very nice for my fine, wavy hair. Does not make it sticky or greasy, which has been a problem with other shampoos and conditioners."
5.00,"Went through the gamut of designer shampoos, and those with green tea and mint, only to come back to this Pantene product. Some of the others felt just about as nice as this one does, but they often ended up irritating my scalp whereas Pantene never does. What I really like is how a little bit goes a very long way. A small squirt in my hand that is about the size of a quarter gives me really good suds, which lets this size bottle last a very long time (even when doing a quick wash at least 5 times per week). Have thick hair that can get oily if not regularly washed, and this shampoo keeps it clean feeling. Play volleyball and tennis and really have the need to shower well after matches, and like this shampoo a lot. Definitely recommend it if you have a similar need."
5.00,"I absolutely love this product! And the service was great as well. I have long hair and this has been the only shampoo/conditioner that makes my hair feel long and silky! Wish Pantene never took it off the shelves!!"
5.00,"My hair has gone through a lot; I used the shampoo and conditioner, styled it and I cant believe how sot, shiny and manageable my hair is now! A definite YES"
4.00,"I am 45 yrs old with baby fine hair and lots of it. I have used many many products without luck. This easy 2 in 1 Shampoo and Conditioner saves time, water, and gives my hair some swingy sexy body. However, I will have to switch come colder weather because it does not moisturize enough for those cold air times."
5.00,"It moisturized my hair and added shine to my dry hair. I used it with the Pantene conditioner and my hair looked great."
3.00,"I have used this shampoo for a week and notice no change in the condition of my hair. It lathers and cleans well and has a nice scent. What else can you expect from a shampoo? I have yet to find one that really \"age defys\" my hair."
2.00,"I bought this the other day at Target because on the mornings I shower before work (rather than the night before), I am always running late. I was hoping to eliminate at least one major step from my routine, so I thought if I used a 2-in-1 for those busy mornings, I could take a faster shower. Well, I knew as soon as I was rinsing it out that it was not going to be the solution. There was no moisture left in my hair, as conditioner leaves. The amount of time I spent trying to brush my wet hair afterward easily tripled the amount of time it would have taken for me to just condition my hair in the first place. I give 2 stars instead of 1 because my hair does feel clean, and it looks shiny. But it feels dry, and I don't think it was conditioned at all. :( Bummer. I was so looking forward to this solution working for me, but I will be returning this bottle, and not buying it again."
5.00,"I have never found a shampoo so perfect for my hair! It keeps my hair clean and strong. I love it!!!"
5.00,"I suppose my hair matches the type targeted for this product, as it is thick. And with it being [self-]cut as short as it is, it can be prone to frizz (not that it bothers me). I just wanted to try the shampoo, okay!? After using this shampoo, my hair feels soft and smooth and my head doesn't look like a fuzzy coconut as it normally might when using some other shampoos without conditioning. The product tackles the problem of dry frizz incredibly well, and it lathers up nicely too. If you have a problem with dry, frizzy hair then I suggest you give this product a try. I think you'll like it."
5.00,"I really like the way this product smells, works and lathers. I don't even need product because it doesn't weigh my hair down. Shiny. Full. Not dry. I use it 5 days a week, no lavender tint."
5.00,"I had used this in the past, and was very unhappy when they stopped making it. I tried two other \"silver\" and a clarifying shampoo in other brands, and threw them away. My ash brown hair with silver strands throughout was looking greige. I was looking for another silver shampoo to try when I found Pantene had brought this back. I ordered right away. After one use of the shampoo and conditioner, my silver hairs reflected more light, and stood out more, and the rest of my hair looked shinier as well. I hope they never sto making this again."
5.00,"This is a great product for those of us who prefer silver to dye. Price was right and convenience could not be beat."
3.00,"I have been using this for a few weeks. If your looking for a daily shampoo and not too concerned about volume, this is meant for you."
5.00,"I like the Pantene Relaxed Hair Shampoo for my hair. It cleans without being harsh. My hair does not feel dry or brittle after use. I purchased the product at Amazon.com because I was no longer able to find it in the local stores."
2.00,"My hair straightened out completely after using the shampoo several times.  But it didn't make it limp and flat because it wasn't very moisturizing.  You get a squeaky clean rinse -- too squeaky for me.  And it didn't help to moisturize or repair damage at all.  Very much like a volumizing shampoo... that straightens the hair strangely.  This may be ideal for some.                                                                     FYI: my hair is fine and wavy with damage from highlights."
5.00,"This is the best shampoo I have ever tried. I dont even a conditioner after using it. Kudos por Pantene!"
5.00,"I love this product so much! About after 2 uses, I saw my split ends mending back together! It makes my hair somewhat shiny, and it protects my colored hair! To me it smells like strawberrys! (: I love it! You should totally get it for split ends, and just to make your hair look great!"
5.00,"This is by far the best conditioner i have ever used. You can see and feel results the first time you use it. I straighten, and blow dry my hair everyday and it leaves my hair shiny and super soft all day long. i would definitely recommend this product."
5.00,"This is a wonderful shampoo for gray hair. I couldn't find it for a year, it was discontinued, but now I see it in a new package and I couldn't be happier. The fragrance is not overwhelming, it leaves my hair shiny and silvery, the price is reasonable - it's all good!"
4.00,"After using Olay bar soap and having a bad case of soap scum on the glass shower door, I called Customer Service at Proctor &amp; Gamble (Phone number on the box) and was told to get this shampoo because it's also made by P&amp;G and being a clarifying shampoo, they told me that it will remove the scum.  Well, it did after about a week of continuous use with a Scotch Brite pad and a great deal of elbow grease.  The reason I gave it 4 stars is because I tried at least 12 other cleaners purported to clean scum without results.  I even tried oven cleaner, tar remover and many other things I thought would budge it and this is the only one to make a dent in the scum.  It must be Pantene brand only. Tried other clarifying shampoo and they didn't work. It's hard to find locally, but Amazon is where I purchased it."
5.00,"I've tried every anti-dandruff product on the market. The only other shampoo that works for me is Head &amp; Shoulders. The difference is Pantene leaves my hair feeling natural and clean. I find the Head &amp; Shoulders dries out my hair too much.                                                                     There is also very little (almost no) \"tingling\", but this stuff works great."
5.00,"Best shampoo Pantene ever made for shiny healthy hair.  Unfortunately they discontinued it.  I have tried without success to find another shampoo that measures up, but can not.  So I'll get it through Amazon while I can."
1.00,"I have very fine, flat hair. This product made it very fine, flat and fly away. Made it soft and silky and really, really fine. Fortunately I had a small sample and got to try it a couple of times. Will not buy full size."
5.00,"This is a great shampoo for blondes. It doesn't leave any strange color in your hair and leaves your hair looking great. Nice scent to it too."
4.00,"This stuff really makes my hair nice and smooth. Dont have to worry about the waves. I have been using it for years now."
5.00,"I wouldn't think of using any other shampoo after this. My hair color is shiny and silver and I bought the conditioner that goes with it. Totally hooked."
5.00,"Seems to be working great so far. It's a good size bottle and I even bought it in a pack of two. Great value, should last for a while."
5.00,"Ice Shine is a great shampoo - my hair is clean and shiny. It doesn't feel stripped or heavy. I have had trouble finding it in the stores so went online and found it on Amazon at the ridiculously high price of $15.40. At retail stores when I've gotten it before, ice shine sells for $7 to $8. So, good product. Ridiculous price."
5.00,"I looked for this shampoo on Amazon after they stopped carrying it at Costco. I've never been committed to a shampoo until now, and I've tried several high end shampoos with no success.. It restores my aging, fine, frizzy, hair to what it was 20 years ago without weighing it down. I really can't ask for more than that!"
2.00,"gives me dandruff. I would rather stay with head and shoulder. Not for everyday use. its cheap but not worth spending money."
5.00,"I have been using pantene for I while and liked it alot for the most part.So, I was excited to try this product for my ecessivly thick curls. The packaging, I must admit was purty (this drew me to it even more; a bit superficial I know) I smelled great: a bit flowery and feminine. Ive been using it for months and have had a sigificant increase in good hair days my hairstylist (whom I have a huge crush on) said I have really pretty hair: but thats just the tip of the compliments iceburg. This produst I would say is for very out of control hair. IT WAS PERFECT! my curls have alot of definition and shine. Ive been buying this over and over (which I never do!)"
3.00,"Your hair may just love this product. But, my hair tends to need a bit more conditioner than this product offers. Give it a try!! It does clean hair well!!"
5.00,"Its really a good product. Its cleaned my hair so smooth."
5.00,"This shampoo leaves my silver highlights bright, but not yellow. It cleans well, but leaves no residue and does not dry the hair or scalp. I have tried a similar product from Clairol, but was unhappy with the dry, frizzy result that came from their shampoo. The price is very fair and since I have Amazon Prime - free shipping. I will definitely order this again."
5.00,"I was pleasantly surprised by Pantene's Blonde Expressions Shampoo for Blonde Highlights. Previous a big John Frieda Blonde shampoo user, I was looking for something a little less expensive. I didn't really have high hopes using Pantene, but I've been loving my hair since I started using it! I actually do see a difference in my blonde highlights since using this Pantene shampoo. They're brighter, more dimensional, and really do appear to sparkle. Also, my hair has felt super soft since I started using this shampoo. I do notice that my hair looks a lot better if I use Pantene every day. I generally like to switch up the shampoo I use on a daily basis, but my highlights tend to look best when I use this day after day. I guess you may not be eager to purchase a 3-pack if you haven't tried this shampoo yet, but you'll most likely want to before long! I use the conditioner in addition to the shampoo and recommend it as well."
5.00,"I have been using this combo for years...love the smell and makes my hair feel great. Cheaper that any store around, and you don;t have to deal with lines...will never buy in-store again!"
5.00,"This shampoo is as good as the expensive French shampoo I used for years. I wish I knew about it sooner, I would have saved a ton of money."
5.00,"Love this shampoo. I swear it blends my grays in. I am 51 and I have never dyed my hair but I have a few grays in the front of my hairline. Using this shampoo daily with the conditioner hides my grays!"
5.00,"Pantene is the brand I have always used and been most satisfied with but I was really happy with this new Clear Scalp Conditioner (the conditioner is great too).  The smell alone makes you want to try it.  It reminds me of the old \"Salon Selectives\" brand.  Anyway, my hair does seem smother and less frizzy.  It is shiny and I got a compliment on it the other day which I hadn't received in a while so it must be working.  It is comparable in price to Pantene as well."
5.00,"I have thin, fine hair and have tried just about EVERYTHING out there to add body to my lifeless and limp locks. I was leery of this shampoo because the shampoo's I have used in the past don't seem to live up to their \"body building\" claims. I am thinking maybe because it is Pantene, which I have always had great luck with, but this shampoo really boosts the body of your hair. It says it is lightweight and it really is! It is very light, smells great and lathers up great. I washed my long hair with it twice then conditioned just the ends, and with a little blow drying with my head flipped over, I had GREAT body! I am very excited, this is the first shampoo that I have tried that has lived up to its claim. I will keep using it and am very excited to have found this product!"
5.00,"I've been using the Pantene Agedefy Shampoo and companion Agedefy Conditioner for the past two weeks and am pleased by the results. Together they have made my hair feel softer and less dry, much as it feels after a trip to my hair stylist. While I have no idea whether these products provide the numerous anti-aging benefits claimed on the packages, they do make my hair feel noticeably better than the cheaper products I normally use. So if experiencing a run of good hair days is a priority for you, this shampoo/conditioner duo may be worth the splurge."
3.00,"I have never used anything in my entire life that dries my skin out as much as this shampoo does. Having said that, it has its uses. What I do is use it ONLY on the most oily parts of my skin to combat the oil production in those areas. In particular I use it in places when my seb derm flares up because that condition thrives on oily skin.I have to be really careful with this product because if I use it on the wrong area it can dry out my skin so much that it is painful."
5.00,"I have fine hair that gets really weighed down by conditioners, and this combo is the perfect answer. Gives you just the right amount of conditioning without any weight or greasiness. Both my husband and I use it and love it. Amazon always has the best price on it FYI"
5.00,"This shampoo does what it says it does on the packaging... Prevents hair fall/breakage & smells nice...Doesnt strip my hair & is gentle enough to use everyday..."
5.00,"I truly love Pantene products,Keratin repair shampoo has help me manage my hair easier and my hair does not fall out as much as before.This prices are amazingly low compare shopping the store around my way where everything its so high in pricing.Thank you Wallmart!"
2.00,"I love to be able to order online because of cancer I am housebound. Most of the things I order comes within a few days, I really like the Pantene shampoo but I think if it was plastic sealed half of the product would not spill all over the other product I ordered and packaging."
3.00,"I love how it helps strengthen my hair. Through all the perms my hair is still full as well as shiny."
5.00,"My wife loves this shampoo/conditioner all in one and has been using it forever. We both love the pump bottles for our shampoo."
5.00,"My 17 year old son has been battling the thinning of his hair. Much to his dismay. We've adjusted his diet (more protien and vitamins), he's had his hair cut so that the weight of it at the crown doesn't stress his scalp, and we've tried every full body shampoo on the market to no avail. I ordered this shampoo and it worked by the third washing! My son is absolutely thrilled! No, his hair is not instantly growing back. It does have more fullness, though, so his thinning crown isn't as noticable. We'll be sticking with this product for the foreseeable future!"
5.00,"I don't understand why Pantene revised their line of shampoos so entirely that a friend &amp; I (&amp; most likely many more people) can no longer find a type that does as well for our hair as what was. Thank goodness I can still find the \"old\" shampoo."
5.00,"My hair came out soft and frizzless,I luv it! I have very long wavy hair and usually blow dry it, I received many compliments!"
3.00,"I love the pump bottle, it is super convenient and easy to use. I love the Classic shampoo/conditioner combo - I have been using it for 10+ years and it works on my very fine long hair. While the doorstep delivery is very convenient, I can buy this exact same product in this exact same bottle in the exact same quantity for a dollar less at the Target two blocks from my house. I mostly ordered it to increase the dollar amount of my order to $25 to get free shipping - so totally worth the extra dollar for that. If they stop carrying this bottle type at my local Target - I am happy to know I can get it here on Amazon. But since I go into Target on fairly regular basis..."
5.00,"I like the brand and the use for white hair, came out beatiful, lustrous and very smooth. I love it"
5.00,"I live in NE Florida where it gets very hot and humid. I use the Moisture Balance shampoo and conditioner, and it really helps my fine, wavy hair behave. It also really helps detangle, saving me from split ends. Hair still blow dries quickly, too. This is an excellent product; I hope Pantene continues this variety."
5.00,"The product I received from VINE was for shampoo, not conditioner.  The product smells great. It left my hair soft. Not coated or stripped.  It decreased the frizz-which is saying quite a bit during the current Michigan high humidiity levels.  I am looking forward to using this again and would buy it. I love the smell and the way my hair feels.                                                                     I am getting negative helpful votes for this review.  I am expected to review every free product I get through Amazon Vine.  I did not get the correct product. I was honest. This should not be counted against me."
3.00,"I have sported a short and spiked style for about 10 years. My father just died recently so, in honor of him, I have been growing my hair out because it is curly just like his, a carbon copy. When I had long hair down the middle of my back, Pantene was the best. It left my hair smooth and shiny so when I decided to grow it back out, I bought Pantene Ice Shine to save money. My brother uses it and that's how I first found out about it. This does not work half as well as using shampoo and conditioner separately. Same smell, saves time, money, and space in my shower, but I will not buy it again for my longer hair as I'm growing it out. Now, if I had short, 2 inch long hair, this would do fine but whenever it's that short, I might as well just buy the $1 a bottle stuff like V05. However, this would be great for family vacations when we take one bag of full-size toiletries for the family to share. Bottom line: would be fine for men and women with very short hair (a few inches long). But, for longer styles, buy Pantene shampoo and conditioner in separate bottles because it makes all the difference in the world."
5.00,"Pantene is the ONLY shampoo I use now! I have dry hair because I am always curling and dying, etc, etc. The moisture balance shampoo really leaves my hair soft, shiny and manageable. And I love the scent! I swear it is just as good as the expensive salon brand shampoos. I highly recommend!"
5.00,"This is hands down my favorite shampoo. It actually does give a little volume to my very fine hair.  I've tried expensive salon shampoos and other common shampoos on the market, but this one works best for me."
4.00,"My hair does feel better and look smoother, but my thin hair is left a little flat, but that could be more the conditioners fault, since I'm using them in combination. The shampoo is thick, smooth, and has a goldish appearance. It feels very rich and lustrous. I've always loved Pantene for the feel of their products."
5.00,"I had dry hair for a long time. The hair place kept selling me their stuff to fix it.I tried this and it was great! It actually works with the repair conditioner.Also, the Nature Fusion Moisture Balance shampoo is better than the other Nature Fusion(smoothing)"
1.00,"I have incredibly fine hair and fight with products leaving behind residue and making my locks look greasy. I bought this shampoo because it promised strengthening and protection for my fine hair, but instead, it leaves a gross build-up on my locks. It's disgusting to the touch and even after rinsing the shampoo out of my hair for twenty minutes, it still looked greasy and dirtier than before I washed it. I will never buy this shampoo again and would never recommend it for other people with my hair type."
5.00,"Very nice shampoo smells good. I used it with the matching conditioner and the results are fantastic!!! No other products needed to get great results. My color, blow dry, curling iron treated hair loves this product and looks healthy. Not oily or weighted down."
5.00,"Love the way this product makes my hair feel. And so many people comment on how shiny the gray in my hair is. Impossible to find anywhere else anymore but on Amazon.com - so I keep a supply on hand in case it goes away for good."
5.00,"I feel it's good price,i love it. I hope that in the future we can have more such opotunities.It's ok."
1.00,"I loved the old formula. This new, \"curly hair series\" formula is AWFUL. If Pantene doesn't bring back the old formula I am switching to a new brand.After using Pantene for 10 years now I have to find something else."
5.00,"The shampoo and conditioner left my hair feeling very silky and soft. I have not used it long enough to know if it actually will repair my hair, although my hair is not very damaged at all. I appreciate being able to try it before purchasing it."
3.00,"I was unable to find this product in my local store, so I ordered it online. It smells different than the former product. It does an ok job, not as good as the one they apparently no longer make."
3.00,"This was touted as an intensive repair for dry, damaged hair. It was just average. Will try Aussie next time."
3.00,"My wife loves this shampoo. But the perfume, or scent, nearly makes me nauseated. No other shampoo, or bath product, has ever affected me like this one does. It does not bother my wife or my son. I can be sound asleep when my wife takes a shower and the smell wafts into the bedroom and wakes me up. Even with the bathroom door shut and the fan on, enough molecules of scent escape to wake me and make me feel awful. My wife had to stop using it. She would give it 5 stars, I would give it one star for its very strong scent which only bothers me. Sometimes my son uses it and the smell goes across the lower level of the house, up the stairs, and across the livingroom to my chair and finds my nose. You might want to see if the manufacturer would send you a sample to make sure that it agrees with all of your family members."
4.00,"I got this to get rid of the brassiness of the blonde highlights that I got. I bleached my hair several times (I know. I'm terrible, right?) and it was blonde to pale blonde. There were some areas where it was orangey so I decided to get this to get most of the brassiness out.                                                                     It does the job. The paleish parts turned light gold while the brassier parts turned to a hay color. It lathers up really well and the shampoo is actually purple to tone out the yellow tones. You should bleach your hair really light if you want it to tone to a silver/white color. But if you already bleached it three times like I did (Yeup. I know.) and can't really do anything more but tone out the brassy yellow and orange colors, this will be perfect. It also smells delicious.                                                                     I just wish it came individually because the two bottles will last me forever haha. So if your whole head is brassy galore, this is so worth the money."
5.00,"Perfect for my 6 year old who has fine hair. It detangles while washing. Smells great too. Highly recommend product."
3.00,"I haven't honestly seen a change in the strength of my hair as of yet, so I'm hoping the other reviews are correct. What I have noticed, however, is this shampoo's smell. Yikes! Chemically. Makes me wrinkle my nose every time I apply it."
5.00,"Excellent shampoo leaves hair very clean and soft! Will buy again. Leaves hair manageable without conditioner. One of the best."
5.00,"This shampoo is perfect for me. Couldn't find it anywhere locally then decided to check Amazon. Bingo!! I am very happy to have a supply of my favorite on hand."
2.00,"This has a great fresh scent but it's too drying. My friends stayed over, and they said the same thing. In this summer heat, moisture stripping is not what I need."
1.00,"I used this product in conjunction with the conditioner and the advanced thickening treatment and I followed the directions exactly. I purchased these items because of the many glowing reviews at Amazon. Sadly, the product did not work for me AT ALL. I have had much more success with Toppik and Folicure lines and can recommend either of them."
4.00,"This item has yet to arrive, but always the shampoo I use so ordering it is nothing new to me"
5.00,"Before using this product my hair was dry and dirty. Now it's shiny, alive, and beautiful. I couldn't be happier"
5.00,"I LOVE this shampoo (and conditioner)! My hair has never been softer and brighter with regular use of Silver Expressions--not a hint of yellow. But my frustration is the now you see it, now you don't experience that I've had. Stores carry it and then they don't; Pantene makes it and then they don't. I was spending far too much time searching out hair products!! Thrilled to find the shampoo on Amazon and hope to see it here for a very long time. Amazon, don't let me down!"
4.00,"My hair is thick and a little bit wavy. I use color to lighten it, and I live currently live in Minnesota, which has the hardest water I have ever used, so most shampoos do not lather, and my hair is usually less than glossy and soft. I also have problems with static, and have been using Liv Aveda's \"Dry Remedy\" since the winter. I try a lot of different hair products, and have not been overly happy with any of them. I received this Pantene Shampoo last week, and have used it a few times now. Since I do not have the accompanying conditioner, I used a couple of different conditioners with it, in very small quantities, as well as a finishing aid once. When I applied the shampoo, it lathered quickly and well. It felt soft as I was using it, which, for me, is usually an indicator of a product that will work well. I washed my hair twice, then applied a small amount of conditioner, and rinsed well. After lightly towel drying my hair, I was pleased at how easily my brush went through my hair, no tangles at all (I typically have to brush pretty hard to get the tangles out). I used a blow dryer and a flat iron to finish and was pleased with the outcome. My hair is fuller with this shampoo than I am used to, but is behaving well. My hair is also glossy and I have no frizziness at the moment, which is good. I plan to keep using this shampoo alternately with a clarifying shampoo, since it looks like the shampoo containd silicone, which tends to build up. I cannot tell how it would behave on finer or coarser hair, but it is suitable for mine. Good product, better than other Pantene shampoos I have tried."
5.00,"this is a just another great product from Pantene. I have thin hair and this makes my hair full and soft. a great product"
5.00,"This shampoo came 2 in a pack for a great price. I couldn't find it in the stores so decided to get it from Amazon. I love this shampoo it doesn't cause a purple tint like some shampoos do if you use it every day. At least that's what my hair stylist said. My white hair is shiny and beautiful. I've gotten quite a few complements on it. Highly recommend giving this brand a try. Price is great and does what it claims."
5.00,"This product has been discontinued and I was fortunate enough to locate it on line.  I have ordered the product twice with superior service from the vendor.                                              Kathryn/Spartanburg SC"
5.00,"I have always liked Pantene products. This shampoo does not disappoint. It cleans very well, leaves hair soft, smells good, and does not weigh fine hair down. I do think my hair has more volume. I would recommend this shampoo. Works just as well, if not better, than expensive salon brands."
4.00,"This is the only kind my husband will use and this has been so much cheaper and better than buying anywhere else."
4.00,"This is one of the best shampoos I've tried for my curls. It added volume and depth to my curls without drying out my hair. There are times when my hair looks perfect but other times when it's not...but that may be the weather and not the shampoo. I'll definitly keep buying it."
5.00,"ITs pantene at its best. It is mild enough yet it cleans well. Smells good too. Good for long hair, dry hair, oily hair, even for kids hair"
5.00,"Got this for my wife,a and she likes it. She's like Mikey...she rarely likes anything that I get her, but she likes this...it has a pleasant fragrance, and makes her hair feels silky soft. Well getting one right out of 999 trials ain't too bad for a dude with his woman."
5.00,"It's a great product, a lot of it, and at a decent price. I am very satisfied with this purchase."
5.00,"I love how clean and smooth it makes my hair. It really does seem to help with my hair breakage."
5.00,"It removes dull and yellowing quickly with one quick shampoo. It is moisturizing enough to leave my thick, natural African hair undamaged. The deep purple color does the trick leaving my hair white/silver giving me a fresh salt and pepper look. I use the shampoo in combination with its conditioner I commented on too."
4.00,"I bought this and the conditioner instead of what I usually use, which is Herbal Essences's Long Term Relationship, and within a week, I can see the difference! My hair is stronger, less frizzy, and much more manageable, Very impressed with how well this has worked"
5.00,"It is quite good and I feel very comfortable with it! It smells so nice and the big size can be used for a long time."
5.00,"Seriously, My grandmother used the washing product RinsoBlue to shine her grey hair! I used to color my chestnut color to keep me young. When there was more grey than brown, I stopped coloring & tried the Silver Expressions. I love it. Everyone complements me on the color & shine. Then I couldn't find it in stores. By accident I found it on Amazon & Bought a bunch of it, just in case. So glad to see it's still around. I really like it & use it."
5.00,"ITS GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!! MY HAIR IS SILK."
5.00,"This product is actually really good for the price. I have medium length, naturally wavy hair, that tends to be too thin after I style it. This shampoo & conditioner combo is a good two in one that leave my dry brown hair shiny, bouncy, and a lot of volume towards the top. It actually works best If you towel dry you hair. If you towel dry your hair at night and go to sleep, it will be full of volume and almost ready to go when you wake up. I am pleased with it."
5.00,"This tamed and smoothed my long, salt and pepper hair without making it feel flat and lifeless. I am loving this shampoo. Sometimes conditioner can weigh my hair down, so I try not to use it that often. I don't have to use any conditioner when I use this shampoo. It gives my hair the perfect blend of bounce and shine, with beautiful body. I also like that it smells fresh and clean, not like perfume. Pantene has always been a favorite shampoo of mine. I'm happy with this line of hair product as it exactly targets what my hair needs!"
3.00,"My hair gets super greasy the next morning if I don't wash it first thing when using this shampoo. Light scent"
5.00,"Had less hair shedding during shampoo. Smells nice & makes hair soft. A little bit of product makes lots of lather. Takes brassiness out of blonde color. My husband even noticed how shiny my hair was!"
5.00,"Don't waste your time and money on expensive \"salon\" shampoos, this is it! I have used this for years and find it never fades my haircolor and gives me beautiful, soft, shiny hair that actually sparkles."
5.00,"HEY EVERYONE, I LOVE THIS LINE OF PANTENE. IT SMELLS GREAT AND LEAVES ME AND MY DAUGHTERS HAIR MANAGEABLE. HAPPY TO SEE I CAN BUY IT IN BULK AND SAVE A FEW DOLLARS. SHIPPING WAS GREAT, NO DELAYS. WILL PURCHASE AGAIN!"
5.00,"This shampoo is awesome, I'm so glad I took a chance on it and came back to Pantene. When Pantene changed their shampoo formula (when the bottles changed to \"fine hair solutions, thick hair solutions\" etc several years ago), I had to start looking for other brands. Their shampoos started leaving a gummy feeling in my hair and made my scalp itch. When I read that Pantene re-did some of their formulas again, I wanted to see if they were more like the old versions that I used to love, and this one is! It cleans well without stripping hair, leaves it light & fluffy but extremely soft. I bought it with the matching conditioner. These out-perform the expensive salon brands I've been using! This combo leaves my hair light, fluffy, smooth, clean, less frizzy, and extremely soft with a natural shine. I've been using them daily for 2 weeks without build-up. Pantene has won this customer back! I will continue to repurchase this combo!"
5.00,"I bought this shampoo and conditioner because my hair was extremely damaged for using Vo5 for a while. I didn't expect my hair to be so healthy-looking after one use, but Pantene stayed true to its word. I love this product. It makes my hair so soft and shiny and protects form damage immediately!"
3.00,"I like Pantene shampoos but this one was a little disappointing. My hair tends to be fly-away when using this shampoo. I like other Pantene shampoos much better. I gave to my husband who tends toward oily hair. I wouldn't recommend it for dry hair."
4.00,"I used it on my hair and it was great. I have gray hair I guess it is more white than gray I get it colored. It has been excellent I liked the way it made my hair feel."
3.00,"While I did like the clean look of the bottle, and the fact that the shampoo itself is clear (no additonal chemicals to color it) I can't give it as high a rating as I would like. Fine Hair Solutions does do a nice job. And it's available at a good price. I don't like it as well as my Paul Mitchell shampoo for fine hair. To be fair, the Pantene Pro-V is much cheaper. My biggest concern may not deter others from liking this shampoo. While there are a few safe ingredients, I was concerned about a few of the chemicals listed. I wish manufacturers would also stop adding fragrance. If deodorant has it, and hair spray has it, and you use perfume, how many fragrances do you need at one time? But until more women feel this way, companies are likely compelled to add yet one more chemical to the mix. To be REALLY fair, I would probably go to a store and read the ingredients on a lot more shampoo bottles. Pro-V may not be any worse than other shampoos. While I am not chemically sensitive, others are. But these people are probably buying products at the health food store instead of the drug store. So for the value oriented person who is unconcerned about chemicals, I would say this is a good deal."
5.00,"I am using this shampoo for 20 years and just loved, my hair looks always very healthy and just perfect"
5.00,". The shampoo and conditioner do a great job of preserving my hair color. My hair is nice & shinny. I get complements on my hair often. I would recommend Pantene."
5.00,"The best shampoo for postpartum hair. This shampoo is the same as Pantene Restorative, which they stopped making. Same ingredients, just different name, packaging, and recommended uses. Leaves hair shiny and soft and looking alive after hormonal roller coaster of pregnancy."
5.00,"After chemo my hair grew back very thin and fine. It was hard to manage because it was always dry and fly-away. This shampoo (and the matching conditioner I bought) adds moisture, makes my hair stay down, and I can now go out most days without having to wear a hat. Thank you, Pantene!"
3.00,"This shampoo seems to leave a residue on my hair. My hair has a tendency to be oily and within 12 hours of shampooing with this, my hair is already feeling oily"
4.00,"Very creamy and silky. Very nice. I liked this product. Later on i bought the hair treatment which is a great product too."
1.00,"Sorry, but I do not like Pantene in the least bit. Yes, its a very affordable price, but the quality sucks. First, if you have colored hair, it drains the color. Second, it eventually dries out your hair. Third, I just don't like it. I have thick, coarse, colored hair. So pantene does not cut it, plus it has sulfate and all those good chemicals in it.Also, \"2 in 1 shampoo and conditioner\" isn't the best idea. Instead of taking the short cut, actually use both. When you use the 2 in 1, your hair doesn't fully get the conditioning it needs because of the shampoo part of it.Instead of using Pantene, I use Loreal Sulfate-free instense nourishing shampoo and conditioner. Its a tad bit more, but not expensive. It loads your hair with good nutrients and takes care of your color without the expense. For expensive shampoos, I like Matrix and Bed Head products. Anyways, I like to stay away from Pantene."
5.00,"I love this shampoo but have trouble locating it in stores. So glad to find it on amazon for a great price."
2.00,"Family dollar prices going up, they Pantene shampoo done went up something serious"
5.00,"These Pantene Pro-V Volume products really do work. I have very thin hair and it definitely improves the texture and fullness. Definitely worth it."
3.00,"A lot of people like this but I have to step back and ask, is it worth the money. $13+ is a lot to pay for a fairly small tube. I used it, lathered up nicely, had no strong smell but I'm not exactly the target audience for the product. I mean I get a haircut when I realize it's getting in my way. MY hair shows no sign of thinning (thank goodness) and has limited the grey to that distinguished bit at the sides like a college professor. Now it does make my hair clean and it seems soft. My wife said there's no smell to it so it works as a good shampoo, BUT I really have to question if it is worth $13+ a bottle for something that could be done for rather less?"
5.00,"I really love this shampoo because it already has conditioner on it and it give me volume on my hair."
3.00,"I like the 2 in 1 shampoo and conditioner because I always have quick showers, I like the smell but after using it a wile my head was itchy and got a little of dandruff."
5.00,"This product is great- I wish I could find it in stores- I would recommend to all my \"mature\" friends! My hair has never looked better"
3.00,"It does an okay job, but it doesn't seem to brighten your hair any and it makes it very heavy."
5.00,"If you are like me and are always dealing with oily hair, I highly recommend this shampoo. It lathers beautifully, and you can literally feel it lifting the oil away. It does wash out leaving hair feeling a bit \"stripped\" and dry, but I've been using it for a few months now and have not noticed any negative effects on the quality of my hair-- on the contrary, my hair dries soft, full, and most importantly, 100% clean. Every so often you can use a little conditioner on the ends of your hair to make sure it doesn't get too dry.                                                                     I can't judge the effectiveness (or lack thereof) of this shampoo on normal or dry hair, but I would assume it's probably not for everyday use unless you really have a lot of buildup. For those with enthusiastic sebaceous glands, however, Pantene's Clarifying Shampoo is a quick and highly effective way to manage oily hair-- I'd highly recommend it."
5.00,"This shampoo is awesome. Makes my hair feel so nice and clean. Definitely recommend."
5.00,"I bought this shampoo because I had tried it at my son's house when we were visiting and I liked the lather this shampoo has. It also seems to make the hair seem thicker which I like since I don't have that much up there anyway!"
5.00,"I was not using any special shampoos for my grey hair and noticed it was turning dull and yellowish brown and I found out about this shampoo. I purchased it and was tickled with the results. the hair that has already dulled has brightened a bit and the gray hair has turned into a bright silver. I am very tickled with this product used with the conditioner my hair feels very soft and is very manageable."
5.00,"UPDATE: 11-28-2012After using daily for a week, I still love this product. HOWEVER, don't fall for the Olay/Pantene marriage hype that it will 'fix 7 signs of aging hair'. While the product does rinse out amazingly well and adds marginal volume, it's sulfate based and for me, it is drying. I find I need to deep condition more than normal with it. The label claims it 'fixes' frizz, dryness and dullness. Dullness seems to be better; hair is shinier. But the frizz/dryness? No way. If you live in a humid climate (it's going into winter here in Ohio and very dry) you might be ok without conditioner. For me? It drys me out a bit. Might be fine in the summer. I haven't noticed any residue/build-up although it does have silicones in it. Hope this helps you out!I have thin, fine hair that is always limp and looks oily after a day. I shampoo every day because otherwise, my hair looks like it hasn't been washed for a week. I have used Pantene products before with so-so results; nothing amazing. I bought this because I read an article about how this formula not only helped with the signs of aging hair, but also gave great body. Here's the thing; I have never used a shampoo without needing at least a very light conditioner (and in the winter, much heavier conditioners) to get the shampoo residue and tangles out of my jaw-length bob. I used this once and I simply could not believe that I could run my hands through my hair after rinsing, still in the shower, without ANY type of conditioner. That's a huge deal for me. My hair is very dry, especially now in winter as I color my grays regularly. Fearing fly-aways, I used a tiny amount of conditioner on the ends and then dried/styled. Wow! Body, shine, softness and none of that heavy silicone layer feeling I've felt from some products before. It's day 2 now and I have to admit; my hair looks great and I haven't washed it again yet! This is my new best friend. Note: Shampoo is yellow/brownish in color, a little thick but easily lathers and rinses out. The scent is nice; not too strong and for a jaw-length bob I only needed about a dime sized dollop. Will update in a week or so to see if buildup is a problem. I still can't believe how well it rinsed out!"
4.00,"This is a good shampoo for fine/thin hair. My daughter liked it very much and said it was like a 2-in-1 in how it left her hair, smoothing it out like a conditioner. It has a pleasant, but mild scent. I also felt it was a good shampoo, considering the price. There are definitely both better and worse shampoos out there, depending on what you spend. We both agreed that the most annoying part of it was the packaging. The cap is hard to open, especially with wet hands. The cap is also a weird recessed design that collects water, but then has drainage holes in it. It seems to collect/dribble shampoo around the cap (which makes it more slippery) and will likely get funky towards the end of the bottle."
4.00,"My hair has been dry, listless and dull for years due to my own abuse but this shampoo added life, shine and body back to my hair.  I am very happy with it"
4.00,"I have fine hair and used the original Pantene Volumizing shampoo for years, but over time, it made my hair frizzy, dry, and more prone to shedding. This new formula is much gentler. It has a gel-like consistency, which won't weigh hair down or make it oily as a creamy formula would. This shampoo made my hair very, very clean. So clean, in fact, that I could probably drop back to shampooing it every other day instead of every day as I normally would. I can wash my hair in the morning and, 24 hours later, it still looks good, without the usual morning after oil slick. As for volumizing properties, my hair didn't go from flat to fluffy overnight, but my stylist recently complimented me on my thick hair, so maybe it's making more of a difference than I realize. My ponytail does feel a little thicker, and my hair holds a style for much longer. The only drawback to this shampoo is that it made my hair tangle more easily. I have to brush it more often during the day. So if you are going to try this shampoo, you should definitely purchase the matching conditioner to keep the tangles at bay. Overall, I'd say I am satisfied with this shampoo. It offers great cleansing, a mild floral scent, and modest volumizing properties. For those who say that it is too expensive, you can easily buy an off brand version of this at just about any grocery or superstore for about two and a half dollars a bottle."
5.00,"When I bought this shampoo I was skeptical of its results since I have tried dozens of shampoos over the years, none making my hair feel or look the way I wanted it to.. I am 53 years old and for about 10 years now my hair was lifeless, dull, looked thin.... I just thought that was something I would have to accept with aging. But WOW after the 1st time using this shampoo my hair is now shiney, full of body and bounce as well as feels fresh and clean like it has not felt in a very, very, long time. It did turn back the hands of time 10 years for my hair. Way to go Pantene you score a perfect 5 on this one!!"
4.00,"First of all, you get a lot of lather from little shampoo, so the bottle should last for quite some time. The smell, for me, is a bit too fruity and I wish it had a more neutral scent. This shampoo is tauted as a product for frizz-control, so the most important aspect of it was whether or not my hair felt less frizzy after I used it. I have very thick hair and it's quite long right now so I wanted to see if this shampoo would buy me some time before my next haircut. The result: My hair feels clean and it does lie closer to my head, controling the \"bigness\" of it. I realize that others say that this didn't help their frizziness at all, but for me, the product did what it claims to do. Recommended."
5.00,"I have thin, superfine blonde hair, but this shampoo gives my hair bounce like no other product has been able to. Even without the conditioner, my hair is smooth and has a little bit of extra volume to it! I love this shampoo!"
5.00,"Love the smell, my hair feels smooth after using it. I bought it with coupon, so it is even cheaper than walmart!"
1.00,"Dear pantene,                                              Let me share with my fellow millions of internet shoppers my experience with your 2 in 1 \"moisture renewals\". When I was in the united states, your 2 in 1 \"moisture renewal\" was soooo good it set the standard to me by which to judge the rest of the shampoos I will be using for the rest of my life: 1)it CLEANSED my hair from the its dandruff and 2)it gave my hair the best non-weighing-down moisture and volume. So what happened now, why am I giving you a 1 star rating? Well I left the u.s after finding a job in the middle east, and I persisted in staying a loyal customer to you by buying the pantenes manufactured there. WRONG DECISION!! It was cheap,and dried my hair so bad it was nightmare. BUT, I refused to judge and instead gave you the benefit of doubt,so I bought a couple of your 2 in 1 \"moisture renewal\" from amazon.com and the ones I got where made for the u.s and mexico judging from the English and Spanish labelings on them.well, I used them, and they made my hair SOO DRY they felt like freaking HAY!! i swear everyone im not making this up!! Why are you manufacturing/exporting inferior quality products outside the united states DELIBARETLY pantene? is that your idea of \"customer satisfaction\"? i just spent $200 or so on your 2 in 1 \"moisture renewals\" is that what I get in return? you're LYING!!  those should be called moisture NON-renewals NOT \"moisture renewals\"!! and you know what, some other  LOCAL brands here are better than yours, i swear!! i hate you pantene and I will NEVER use your products ever again. and please dear reader if you're reading this DON'T use pantene products outside the u.s/(and probably) Canada!! this is for your own good!!                                                                     shame on you pantene!!                                                                     p.s: why did you release a new line of your products that consists primarily of separate shampoos and conditioners? Is it because your brilliant chemists(the same chemists who deliberately sold/manufactured crap to/in non-u.s countries) are unable to formulate 2 in 1's anymore? Or is it because pantene wants to make its customers pay twice for their products now? Just wondering..."
5.00,"very good! withohut silicone! easy to celan and wash without any sticky or bad feeling! Fragrance is not strong. Nice and cheap!"
5.00,"Great product good price make hair feel soft would buy again when I run out a little shampoo goes a long way"
5.00,"Hey the Shampoo & Conditioner does wonders on my hair. Is there any way you can send more samples of your products. Plus my sample that came in the mail was beautiful of how the company sent in the little box."
3.00,"This shampoo is Classic Care and I thought I ordered Classic Clean which is a product I have used and really liked. The Classic Care is not right for my hair which is very fine. It makes hair too limp. The Classic Clean gave more fluff and lift. I wanted to return the product, Classic Care, but had thrown away the box it arrived in. I don't know if I ordered the wrong product or if wrong one was sent."
4.00,"This shampoo is great. I have just enough curl in my hair that it tends to frizz a little. Just used this shampoo for the 1st time and no frizz!"
5.00,"This is the best shampoo and condition combo that I've used - even compared to many much more expensive salon products (specifically with my hard water at home). I experienced better results after 1 use. Even with blow drying, hair is smooth and style lasts."
4.00,"I think the fragrance is close to ripe cantaloupe. When I first started using the shampoo, the smell reminded me of fruit-punch bubble-gum. Pleasant, not overpowering. The viscosity of the shampoo is like a stiff moisturizer. The bottle can stand stably right-side-up or upside-down. The shampoo rinses clean and doesn't leave my hair or scalp feeling excessively conditioned. I have short hair and shampoo every day. I usually don't use conditioner, and this shampoo doesn't feel overly harsh. It's not nearly as harsh as clarifying shampoos. After using this shampoo for about two weeks, I think my hair may be a little smoother. But it's hard for me to control for changes in humidity. Reading the ingredients, the difference between this and ordinary Pantene Pro-V < [...]> is the addition of Cocamidopropyl Betaine (which Wikipedia says is an antistatic agent), and the substitution of sodium for ammonium as the detergent counterions."
5.00,"Several months ago I switched to using Pantene shampoo and my hair feels softer and easier to manage. I like the smell of the shampoo as well. It generates a nice leather and you don't have to use much each time. One bottle goes a long way.During the last year the price varied from 15.48 to 13.29. So the current price of $13.70 is pretty good. I found a nice tool that shows history of Amazon prices and allows you to generate alert emails when the price reaches the desired price. If you enter \"price history alert\" in Google it will be come up at the top, it has the word camel in the name. I find this tool to be very helpful.I like Pantene Pro-v Nature Fusion shampoo and will buy it again."
5.00,"Perfect for my hair!"
5.00,"I have waist length baby fine hair that just wants to split and snarl. Hard to get a brush through for the last six inches from the bottom, always tangling. Since I've changed to this Keratin Repair line of Pantene the tangling problem is all but gone, my hair is shinier, silkier, has a bit more body, and is much easier to get a brush through without 'sticking' in the tangles. I also use the Keratin repair fusing, and the 60 second treatment in the Keratin Repair line, and they all perform wonderfully. I'm so glad to have found this. I will never go back to any other product as long as this is made. I'm extremely pleased with it."
4.00,"I'm a fan of Pantene, though I don't use it exclusively. When I started cutting my hair shorter, the need for a frizz-free shampoo became somewhat apparent. I hadn't much luck with those I'd tried and consigned myself to using gel and spray to hold things together. Imagine my surprise when I tried this out and found my frizz was greatly reduced! There are some days (high humidity ones specifically) where it just can't keep all the random fuzz down, but for the most part, I really found a product that actually works and reducing the frizz all around!"
5.00,"I've been using this shampoo for years and haven't found a need to change to any other. It is great!"
5.00,"My hair used to be super thick, but as I have gotten older it has definitely thinned out. I tried the Pantene Pro-V Fine hair solutions and found it does a great job of giving my hair lift and vitality. My hair feels soft and fuller. With repeated use it has helped me to achieve a fuller hair style."
2.00,"I regret that I so quickly responded to my first use of this product and the initial praise. The results did not continue, and I'm back to the flatness of before."
5.00,"I have been using this for about a year now and I can tell you that you can see the difference with my hair. I don't loose as much when combing after I wash it and the ends look better than they have in a very long time. My hair is down to my bottom, and totally grey, so this has been one of my best changes."
5.00,"I wanted a good shampoo for the price and this seemed to be what I needed seems to work well with my hair"
4.00,"This product has the same high quality of all Pantene products. It's not too thick so should be easy to get every last drop out of the bottle. It suds up very well so doesn't take a large quantity to get a good wash. My only complaint, and it's very subjective, is that I was expecting a very smooth, squeaky clean type of feeling on my hair after the wash and prior to the conditioner. This formula actually makes my hair feel a little rough, as though it leaves a film on my hair after washing. This feel remains after conditioning as well. Once my hair dries it's smooth and easy to brush and comb so the final result is as expected. Other than this one, admittedly minor, gripe it's a good shampoo that works as advertised."
4.00,"This is a nice product--it's thick, smells good, leaves my hair soft and clean, lathers easily, and doesn't require (at least for me) a separate conditioner. I don't see much to the name Age Defy--talk about hype. I think there's way too much emphasis on looking/staying young these days. I can't imagine a shampoo being a life saver. This shampoo, like most others has lots of artificial chemicals--whether this is important probably depends on the user. Mostly, since I travel quite a bit and stay in hotels, I use lots of hotel shampoos. They work fine in general. This one seems to leave my hair a bit better than they do, but then I've got to pay for another one. Thankfully, Amazon Vine provides test products for free. Great idea! So, I like this product, but I liked a previous one I got from Vine even better."
1.00,"Packaging wasn't good at all. When arrived the bottles have leaked all over everything and only one bottle was full after I have gone through the big mess..."
1.00,"I hate the new formula. The old one made my hair shiny and bouncy and this one does just the opposite. It actually looked worse AFTER I washed it. I would give it zero stars if I could. I'm so disappointed because now I have to find another shampoo. Why do companies feel they have to change their products all the time?"
5.00,"Grandmother enjoys this product because it prevents yellowing. A bit pricy, but helps keep hair smooth in conjunction with keratin treatments."
4.00,"I am a Pantene shampoo user for many years. I found the fusion version really good and cleans my hair thoroughly. Shampooing ends brings the right texture to my hair. I have oily hair type which tends to become oily by the end of the day. So I would suggest this one for similar hair type."
1.00,"I tried this shampoo with the hopes of it would get rid of the yellow in my hair. But instead I got purple hair. I have thick silver hair and left it on the appropriate time and the underneath of my hair turned purple. I stopped using it and used a regular shampoo for over a month and still had purple hair. I went to my hairdresser and he tried clarifing shampoo and it took some of it off but not all. So here I am a 60 year old woman with purple hair."
4.00,"I'm writing to review the new Fine Hair Solutions Flat to Volume shampoo. It's really nice. It smells great, lathers well and seems to clean hair like a clarifier which is why I bought it. Pantene discontinued their clarifying shampoo (tears shed) but I think this clear, thick shampoo is its replacement. Try it out if you want to get really squeaky clean hair."
5.00,"This is not your grandmothers purple shampoo / conditioner. My blonde hair is in the transition to gray and I decided that I dont want to color anymore, but need something to brighten my hair and bring out natural highlights. This shampoo fits the bill! I have purchased both the shampoo and conditioner and I couldnt be more pleased. I absolutely love this stuff. Its easy and healing on your hair, leaves it soft and with wonderful highlights."
4.00,"I have been trying products for a long time to find a haircare product that suits my hair.Finally I found a product that makes my hair bounce & has transformed my lifeless hair into shiny , bouncy & healthy hair.I'm soo in love with the way my hair feels after using this. U shud give it a try."
3.00,"While this shampoo smells very good, I really did not notice a difference in my hair. It seems to stay flat unless I used mousse."
5.00,"I have tried many different 2 in 1 shampoo and conditioners, but this is the last that I will buy...it is exactly what I have been searching for!!"
5.00,"I was ecstatic to be perusing Amazon today and find this Product was BACK!! I was searching Amazon...wondering WHAT NEW PURPLE SHAMPOO was I going to test drive now that I had run out of the Shiny Silver Ultra that I usually got at either Sally's or Amazon...but noticed a steep $2.00 price jump from the last time I purchased it on Amazon. I turned to that shampoo out of SHEER DESPERATION when Pantene took away my old trusty Silver Expressions. You see, this 45 y/o silver headed white woman doesn't like change...of any kind. I don't like it when the pharmacist changes the color of my meds...I don't like it when there is a detour on my USUAL route...and I don't like it when I CAN'T GET my FAVORITE SHAMPOO!!! Soooo GLAD it's back!!! It works. It smells good and it makes my long, silver locks STAND OUT in a SEA of ladies that are still coloring theirs up...and THAT'S what I do like :)"
1.00,"All 3 bottles that were in my shipment, the tops popped open and 1/2 of the product was out of the bottle upon arrival, i couldnt find anywhere to file a complaint and wasnt going to waste my time over $5, but i know i will never order it again"
5.00,"Pantene has a great Product for the Price. I tried to find this product on our local stores and was told the Pantene no longer offered it."
5.00,"A person at a drug store told me she used this shampoo. I am glad I started using it. Great product."
5.00,"All of the Pro-V restore products are excellent. It is too bad that they are so hard to fine. Pantene seems to have increased the length of names and cut back on their Pro-V restore line. Their best all time product was the green / white and gold container Pro V Restoratives line, especially their conditioner but for some reason they discontinued that. I wrote down all the ingredients from the list on the container of the original and searched until I found that Pantene restore beautiful lengths frizz control has the same ingredients. However even that has been hard to get. It is a real pain. It was only through Amazon that I was able to locate it at all. Pantene must have geniuses working for them who think the only way to improve something that does not need improving is to re-package it and change the name. If the customer gets confused enough, they might try all the \"new\" ones they put out. What they do not take into consideration is that sometime the customer just gets fed up and leaves their brand altogether."
5.00,"I didn't get my order as it was damamged and returned to sender but I do love this particular Pantene product - great for after perms or coloring - or just because you need a little extra moisture due to cold weather, heat drying or sun and chlorine damage."
5.00,"I've used Pantene for many years. It keeps my extremely curly hair clean and moisturized. The pump bottle is a first for me and I'm enjoying how easy it is to get the product out of the bottle. If you want a good shampoo give it a try."
5.00,"Been using this shampoo for years and love it,always leaves my hair feeling soft and smooth.Amazon has the best price for it and i would highly recommend it for everyone."
4.00,"I have purchased pantene products in the past and am very pleased how this product works to preserve the color. Gray is starting to show, so when I color my hair, I like it to last as long as possible. This does the trick. The large bottle with the pump is a plus."
5.00,"Hair was dull and lifeless, just like the commercial said it was...lol. Anyway, to be serious here, the stuff works fantastic if you have silver or even gray hair. Makes it silky smooth and shiny as possible."
5.00,"I live in Orlando, FL and it's very hot and humid here in the summer. My wife and daughter have a terrible time with their hair and trying to control the frizz. This shampoo is part of a group of Pantene products intended to deal with that issue. Pretty much immediately after using this shampoo, they both noticed a difference. The shampoo alone didn't remove all the frizziness from their hair but it did help quite a bit. We haven't tried the other Pantene products that go with it, but we are very happy with the shampoo. We pretty much just use Pantene shampoo and conditioner and now they will be using this specific line."
5.00,"I love the new Pantene AgeDefy collection. The conditioner is amazing and the shampoo works just as well. It really smooths out my hair and leaves it clean but also very moisturized. It feels like it's slowly changing my hair texture for the better."
4.00,"I have been using this shampoo and conditioner for about 1 year now. I like the fact that it doesn't weigh down my hair but leaves it feeling clean and conditioned. I ordered a box of 6 of each of the shampoo and conditioner so I will be set for awhile."
1.00,"I could not run a comb through my hair and it stripped out my color! never again! Stick with nexxus, wen and redkin and you will do well"
5.00,"This was exactly what I expected -- it cleans my hair and doesn't have too much perfume. Develops a nice lather. Seems identical to the Pantene Pro-V you buy anywhere else. After the first shipment I signed up for subscribe and save so I wouldn't forget to get it."
5.00,"this shampoo and condititoner is a great valur for the price that I have paid for many expensive and it is reasonable in price"
5.00,"Great results - I found this shampoo to be perfect for me. It highlighted my hair with the silver accents for my gray, and the texture of my hair was wonderfully soft after using. The price was excellent. For a very hard-to-find product, this is the answer!"
4.00,"While I don't many of the problems listed on the label that this product is supposed to help, I do fight with unruly grey hair. My hair is about 70% my natural color and 30% grey, but those awful greys want to stick up and be noticed. After using this shampoo for about a month I can say that I like it. It lathers well yet rinses clean without leaving any residue behind with a pleasant fragrance. It leaves my hair soft and manageable without being so overly moisturized that it hangs limp. Do all of the greys stay hidden because of it - no, but they are definitely easier to control."
5.00,"great product, makes hair feel thicker immediately. I also use the ADVANCED THICKENING TREATMENT and it works well too. I have used NIOXIN SYSTEM 1 and LOREAL VIVE PRO THICKENING but they weren;t as good."
4.00,"I had gotten a sample of the shampoo and condition....I have used it 1 time and love it! it has made my hair soft and manageable and less frizzy with just 1 USE I am going to buy it as soon as I get back to Walmart....would recommend to anyone who wants soft manageable beautiful hair! the smell is also wonderful!"
1.00,"This product is being touted to replace the original adv. (Eve Mendez) BREAKAGE to STRENGTH for MEDIUM to THICK hair. It is NOT the same! Compare the ingredients 1 is missing & 1 is different. There IS a difference in the product, I have used both & can tell. I hate when companies do this! It was obviously a good selling product so WHY did they choose to take it away?"
2.00,"Pantene's products tend to be color-coded, and red is for curly hair. When I saw my old red-accented bottles for both shampoo and conditioner, though there seemed to be a name change, it was easy to assume it was the same product renamed.Wrong. Sometime around 2011 Pantene did a formula change. You may have bought (and liked, as I did) the old \"Dry to Moisturized\" or \"Hydrating Curls\". For my hair, these were both very good and curl defining, and kept my hair in good shape despite its being fine and permed.Then came \"Moisture Renewal\". For me, the shine is gone, the curls are gone, no definition... and there's an annoying slime left on the tub, so I can only imagine what it's doing to my hair.I'm only catching the formula change now, as I tend to stock up on shampoo and conditioner on sale and I sure do miss the old stuff. A call to Pantene today confirmed my perception of this change... and their rep didn't even try to recommend something more suitable, or offer a coupon or anything in the way of an apology. Visited Panetene's site as well, only to find others posting there as unhappy as me.So, just a heads up that \"red\" doesn't mean what you're used to. I was thinking I'd just gotten a bad perm... then I dug out one of the old \"Hydrating Curls\" bottles I had, and in 2 days I knew what the issue was.Pantene... you need to bring back your old formula."
5.00,"Pantene is all I buy it works very well on all kinds of hair. There is a Pantene for everyone. Dry hair not a problem. Frizzy hair, no problem finding a Pantene for that. Need a shampoo and conditioner in one? Pantene has that. I love the silky feeling it gives my hair and the nice shine."
1.00,"The bottle came to me in a plastic bag, but the bottle had opened up and spilled all over the bag. It's a mess! I filed a complaint but never heard back."
5.00,"Hi there, my name is Dani Alexandra, user: individani on youtube and I'll be doing a review for Pantene Red Expressions Shampoo today.                                                                     As a hair product user I'm always trying to find the least evasive ways to help my hair look healthy and shiny. I'm not really into big treatments or going into a salon to do my hair all the time, so I am trying this product for a quick and easy alternative.                                                                     The directions for it are pretty simple, anyone who can shampoo their hair knows how to use this product. You put a dime size amount (or more) in your hand and with wet hair you lather the product throughout your hair. Just like shampoo. This product does not stain your skin, and since you're using it while showering you don't really have to worry about it staining your clothes.                                                                     I've been using Pantene Red Expressions Shampoo for a few days now. As you can see my hair is red but it was dyed with a semi-permanent hair dye before hand.                                              Semi-permanent, as you probably know, washes out over time- the Pantene Red Expressions Shampoo is really helping maintain my color so I don't have to keep dying it over and over.                                                                     I'm not too sure how it would work with hair that isn't red or brown- but I know for a fact that this shampoo does not take the place of actually dying your hair red. You can see the pigment in the shampoo when you pour it- and you can just see that it's not meant to be a replacement for hair dye.                                                                     Like most Pantene products the condition it leaves my hair in is very nice. There is no oily feeling or overly dry feeling.                                                                     One thing I noticed is that on the bottle it explains that this product should be used in conjunction with other Pantene Red Expressions products and I highly recommend doing that in order to get the fully intended affect of this product.                                                                     1. Good for maintaining semi-permanent red coloring.                                              2. Doesn't leave hair dry or brittle, despite the coloring attributes it has.                                              3. Easy to use, just like shampoo.                                              4. For all you red heads and brunettes out there looking for a little pop of color without going to the salon, this is a good choice!                                                                     It's a really big shame that they no longer sell this product in stores. It's a great product- with multiple benefits! Bottles are still available for reasonable prices online (that's where I got mine).                                                                     Thanks for watching! Enjoy your shampoo!"
5.00,"I'm only 34 years old but for some reason my has has become completely dry and liveless in the last 6 months. I got the shampoo just because I saw a big ad in a magazine and I've learned that usually when a company isn't afraid to spend millions on a promotion, then there's a reason to it. At the same time, my past experiences with Pantene were mediocre. After just the first wash my hair felt much softer and the split ends less visible. The more I used it the better. So I also added the conditioner, and I must say I am absolutely shocked how well this combo works. fyi, I don't have thick hair. I am blond with thin-medium thick hair, kind of wavy, often hard to manage. I love this line for my hair!!!"
1.00,"I bought this shampoo because as my hair has turned white it has naturally become thinner. I was hoping this moisture additive would produce more volume. What I got was hair that did not feel clean. It felt like I had made an error and shampooed with only a creamy moisturizer. I just felt I looked like I needed a shampoo."
5.00,"This product worked well for me. It was effective, smelled good and did not strip my hair. I would definitely recommend it for other natural hair wearers who want to make their silver hair shine."
5.00,"I have really curly hair and lots of it. When it is humid I have a lot of problems with frizz. This shampoo definitely helped in taming my frizzy hair. It also restored moisture in my hair. It feels softer and looks shinier. I don't use much of shampoo when shampooing. I use about a quarter size and make sure the water is warm. Don't want it to be hot or too cold. I make sure I rinse real well too. I noticed that when I started doing this that I ended up getting real good results. I enjoy a hot shower but washing your hair in hot water is not the best idea. Rinsing well makes sure that you remove all the shampoo and that when you dry you don't have residue from the shampoo. Overall I like the shampoo and feel like it makes a difference on how my hair feels. Make sure you pair it with the conditioner for maximum results."
5.00,"What can you say about a shampoo? I have used this a few times now; one time I let my hair air dry and one time I blew my hair dry. Both times provides the same results - fluffy hair that didn't feel weighed down. I like that this is clear shampoo and not gunked up with color/additives. The smell is very nice. I have a sort of bionic nose and can be overwhelmed with scents sometimes, but this shampoo's smell is very nice. My hair feels very clean and not overly scented. I love it! I would definitely purchase this again."
5.00,"This shampoo is great it works and leaves my hair shiny and clean I really recommend this stuff it's awesome.!"
5.00,"I love this shampoo, I had looked all over for it, with no luck. So happy I could order it from Amazon...it really removes all residue from your hair!!!"
5.00,"This is a product that I have been using for many years, evolving as it has been to be a one kind of product for different types of hair. The combination of shampoo and conditioner makes it convenient too. The lid is stable enough to support the bottle upside down."
4.00,"Shampoo has been used for the past two weeks, to positive results: very soft, very clean hair. The scalp seems to be less dry, no longer issues with itching and dandruff, the final result after each use is a sense of overall balance and health for the hair. Overall a great product to make your hair feel healthy and look more vibrant.I do apologize if this sounds like a commercial, but from my personal experience I really feel this is an above average shampoo. 4 Stars."
5.00,"My hair looks dry before I use this shampoo but now I feel my hair look healthy and beautiful ."
5.00,"I have severely damaged hair from months of bleaching it at home. Now that I have stopped bleaching it and have dyed it back brown, my hair is frizzy, dry, and breaks off easily. I just started using the Breakage to Strength shampoo and conditioner and it works better than any other product I have tried! It even works better than the more expensive salon brand deep conditioners! It has left my hair softer and stronger and it smells wonderful! I would absolutely recommend this product to anyone with damaged hair!"
5.00,"I used gym shampoo after swimming for convenience. Cannot believe how terrible it was. It helps me to appreciate Pantene more. I've been loving it for years and found this particular formula hold moisture longer."
3.00,"This shampoo replaced a wonderful Pantene product that helped hold the color red and enhanced it.  This one is the one that is available so I am stuck.  It cleans my hair beautifully but does not enrich the color as the previous product did so well."
5.00,"I would definitely recommend it to my friends."
5.00,"It made my hair so soft without making it feel weighed down!! Loved this product and along with the conditioner made my hair feel light as a cloud!"
5.00,"I really like this shampoo and like being able to purchase it in packs of 3. It's another great product from Pantene."
5.00,"I use this more often before I color my hair and I can tell it makes a huge difference. Also makes my hair shiny and so very soft. Defiantly a good buy and will buy again."
5.00,"I have used this shampoo for many years.  Pantene has discontinued the shampoo and introduced a new line of shampoos.  I tried five of them and did not like them.  I ordered the moisture renewal  shampoo through amazon so I could have a supply.  It is a wonderful product. My hair is soft, manageable, and healthy with this product.  I hope Pantene will re-introduce the moisture renewal products."
5.00,"I purchased this item as an alternative to a more expensive item. It works miracles on my curly, blonde bleached hair."
4.00,"I like this shampoo. I used Pantene in the past, but I've been using Suave for Men for several years now. This product produces more lather than the Suave and seems to get my hair cleaner using much less shampoo. So, while it might cost more per bottle, the value to me is greater with this. When I first started using this, it did seem to make my hair feel more dried out, which might just be because the Suave that I use also has a conditioner in it. So, I now use a separate conditioner from time to time. I took away one star for that, but if you already use a separate conditioner, then that's not an issue. It really does seem to give my hair more volume. Perhaps it's simply cleaner than it was when I used the Suave, but I tend to think that it's doing what it claims to do. The scent is just fine to me, also. So, I recommend giving it a try."
3.00,"I bought this to take on vacation. It's preferred by myself and my wife when we are travelling as you routinely run into hard-water scenarios when staying at hotels. We use different shampoos and conditioners when at home but this does a decent job."
5.00,"These products really do what they say. My hair feels soft, thicker and fuller. I have thin hair and it was falling off alot. This product has really improved the look and fullness not to mention that I see less hair in the shower."
1.00,"I am 54 and about 30% grey. I have been using pantene for about as long I can remember. So here I go. I bought shampoo and conditioner. It did tame my grey hair but my hair was dull ,weighed down and just plain drab. No silky smooth feeling at all. My hair also was falling out more than usual. I used it for 2 weeks to give it a chance. Washed my hair today with good ole regular pantene and it feels good to be back to smooth and silky, and I will live with my unruly grey hair.: )"
5.00,"Have used other Pantene shampoos for years and thought I would try this new one...so far it works great...time will tell."
5.00,"This is a nice everyday shampoo. It leaves my hair clean, shiny, and manageable. I like the pleasant scent also."
3.00,"I think I'm not gonna buy this anymore. Pantene is too dry for the hair. I think I have to find something else."
5.00,"I ordered this Pantene product for my sister who is currently in a Rehab. center. She told me her hair was becoming dull and very brittle. She used this product for one week then called me with her thoughts. She loved it and said her hair was back on track and very healthy again. I use Pantene myself and love it. I was very happy that she was happy. Would certainly recommend to others."
5.00,"ive used this shampoo for about a year. i use this along with the accompanying conditioner and my hair dresser tells me to keep up the good work. i do have thicker hair too and it works nicely. the scent on this is pleasant and not too girly. also if you ever have lady friends over, they wont have to cringe at 2 in 1 shampoo bottles. but again i recommend to get the accompanying conditioner."
3.00,"Pantene makes some good products, but I should have known better than to get a 2-in-1 shampoo and conditioner. It leaves my hair feeling 'filmy' and still somewhat unclean. Their regular shampoo does not have this characteristic. I give that one five stars."
4.00,"This is one of the few shampoos I've used that actually lives up to its promises! After using it for a few days, I did notice a difference. My hair wasn't as frizzy and the gray hair wasn't as unruly. One of the things I liked best was that I no longer had to use conditioner or detangler, as my hair combed out with no problem after washing. Love that! My only complaint was I couldn't skip a day between washings, as my hair is a little oily and whatever ingredients used to control the frizz made my hair a little oily-looking the second day. Will definitely be buying this for myself!"
4.00,"I wanted a product that made my hair appear thicker and fuller, and after reading the reviews I decided to get the Pantene combo of shampoo, conditioner and styling gel. I'm very happy with the results."
4.00,"It had been about 10 years since I had used Pantene so I decided to try it again as the commercials are mesmerizing and I remember how great my hair smelled. I also live with a finicky man so I knew that whatever I buy, he would use too. Lets just say, if they made a 4-in-1 anything, he'd be the first to buy. So I decided to go with this low maintenance 2-in-1 Classic Care, we both have fine hair so I didn't want to pick anything that would weigh it down. Needless to say, every day has been a good hair day with great-smelling bounce, wave, and volume; and the man is happy because he has one step to worry about. I will say that dryness has been an issue, as my hair feels like straw. The biggest downside to Pantene is that it contains loads of sulfates, which is the same ingredient in many grease-cutting detergents. I will buy this shampoo again, because it is easy and produces good looking results, but I will most likely supplement with a higher cost shampoo that has lower sulfates and more softening ability."
1.00,"Amazon needs to give more than 30 days to return something like this, it takes awhile to see the results on a product like this. It dried my hair out even more, I ended up throwing it out and wasting my money. Boo hiss."
1.00,"As someone who is very wary of Shampoos and Conditioners with Silicones and Sulfates in them, I was excited to see this. However, after I bought it I looked at the ingredients I found that this shampoo contains Dimethiconol...a non-water soluble SILICONE. So needless to say I won't be buying this shampoo anymore."
5.00,"If you have fine and oily hair this is the shampoo for you.  I just used a dab of Pro-V conditioner and it helped make my hair more manageable."
5.00,"This shampoo leaves ahir smelling wonderful and leaves it feeling soft! I love this shampoo and the conditioner , I will def. be purchasing this as long as they carry it !"
5.00,"Our whole family loves the Pantene Pro-V Expert Collection Advanced+Keratin Repair shampoo and conditioner. We find this product to be superior to Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy shampoo and conditioner by Organix, which actually has a drying effect. The Pantene version leaves our hair feeling healthy, shiny, soft and silky. I still would recommend Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy flat iron spray, however, as a leave in conditioner, especially if you use heating elements on your hair. Their leave in conditioner is superb, better than Pantene's leave in conditioner version, which is a cream."
5.00,"My rather dry, shortish, mostly gray hair did respond well to the Pantene Pro-V Expert Collection Agedefy Shampoo (my what a long name), becoming softer and smoother without use of conditioner (which I intentionally left out in out to accurately guage the shampoo). It truly delivers as well (better?) as high-end salon brands I have used. Using this Pantene Pro-V, I noticed very mild scent that I have trouble classifying . . . maybe floral, but not really strongly feminine. Pleasant enough, but very muted and not a major feature of this shampoo. I thought the lather was relatively thin. On closer examination, the lather was actually quite creamy with a lot of body, but lacked a lot of the foaminess that I am used to with other brands. After air drying, I found my hair to be unusually soft and \"slick\" to the touch. Definitely. Again, this was without the use of a conditioner. I'm very pleased with this Pro-V Agedefy and was actually pleasantly surprised, as I generally find that among mainstream shampoos one is about as good as another and I end up with the same old stiff, dry, grayish hair. My hair is still gray (there are other products to address that as desired), but feels pleasingly soft and smooth. Make your own decisions about the price and how much you are willing to spend (this is not by any means cheap), but it is indeed an unusually good shampoo in my experience."
5.00,"My hair was very damaged from bleaching, the dryer, and flat iron. After using this shampoo for about 6 weeks, my hair dresser says my hair is in great shape and has remained so with regular use for about six months now.                                              Trouble is this shampoo has been discontinued. So you must purchase from amazon or else where if you want it."
5.00,"I have tried lots of different shampoo/conditioner. Good kit for the price. Leaves my hair soft, not standing up in places."
2.00,"I have very thick, very long, and very wavy hair for a man, so I'm always looking for shampoos that can straighten my hair so I don't have to resort to a straightening iron. So far the best I've found is Herbal Essences \"Dangerously Straight.\" However I'm always looking for something new. When I got the chance to review this shampoo and the accompanying conditioner, Pantene Pro-v Medium-thick Hair Solutions Frizzy To Smooth Conditioner, 12.6-ounce (Pack of 6). Unfortunately, this shampoo does not hold up under fire. In fact, instead of unfrizzing my hair, it turned my head into a giant mass of snarls and knots. The hair actually curled up more and made my hair a living nightmare. The conditioner helped somewhat, but this was one of the worst shampoo experiences of my life. It was painful trying to get all the snarls out post shower. With that in mind, you're probably wondering why I didn't give this a one star. Well, my girlfriend has very straight hair and we tried it on her and it actually gave her hair body. So on two different people the shampoo did the opposite of what it was supposed to. With me, it was horrific, but with her, it actually gave her the effect she normally looks for in shampoos that are supposed to add body. So take note Pantene - rebrand who is supposed to get this shampoo, and you have a winner. For people like myself who have medium-thick hair and are looking for something to get the curls and friz out, do NOT try this or you will regret it horribly."
5.00,"My hair has always been baby-fine, so I'm skeptical about products that claim to add body. What a pleasant surprise to finally find one that works! I could see a big improvement the first time I used AgeDefy. My hair is definitely less fly-away. I've been using this shampoo for about two weeks now, and my hair is less dry and doesn't look as thin. I can even blow-dry it without having it get static-y. I can't speak to the other AgeDefy claims because I don't have a problem with breakage or split ends or what they call \"unruly gray.\" I've always been a light blonde so I'm turning more white than gray, and I don't see any difference in color. All I know is that I like how my hair feels and how it holds its shape now. And that's enough to make me very happy."
5.00,"Keeps my dry, naturally curly hair from frizzing or drying out. I travel a lot and use hotel shampoos out of desperation, but I always love coming home to my Pantene pump. No caps to unscrew or clog."
5.00,"You will not immediately see the effects of Pro-V expert agedefy shampoo. Give it up to 4 days and you will find that it delivers on its promise to manage unruly, dry hair. It also makes you feel that you have given your hair a refreshing oil treatment. Pantene products are good ones and this new shampooo tops the rest. Enjoy smoother, more vibrant hair."
5.00,"The first time I used this shampoo and conditioner my hair looked and felt good, but after the fourth time I used it my hair looked a felt the best it had in years! I have thick, straight-ish, light brown hair and it makes my hair soft without making it flyaway. I don't color or perm my hair so I don't know how well it works on treated hair. I use it in combination with . I got this as a free trial, but I've already ordered more."
4.00,"Loving the smell and lather of this shampoo. It's light and fresh and not too chemically, and it leaves my hair shiny and soft. It's on the repeat list!"
5.00,"THIS SHAMPOO WAS GOOD. THIS SHAMPOO WORKS NICELY. I'M USING EVERYDAY IN THE MORNING MY HAIR WAS SOFT AND SHINY. THIS SHAMPOO WAS GREAT I DON'T HAVE TO BUY EACH ONE BY ONE. BECAUSE THIS SHAMPOO WAS 2-IN-1. THAT WAS CONVENIENT USE IN ONE BOTTLE. I LIKE IT."
1.00,"Felt like it completely stripped all the good stuff off my hair. I am sorry I purchased Pantene but I won't make that mistake again."
3.00,"Silicone in hair care products can do a number of things. It can make the hair appear smoother and less frizzy and it can make split ends less noticeable. It can definitely add shine. In fact, silicone is the active ingredient in most of the \"shine\" products (sprays and oils) on the market. It does this by coating the hair, which for me presents a problem. I have a lot of hair but the texture is fine, and I find that products with silicone tend to weigh it down, making it too flat and stick straight. When I used this shampoo my hair was soft, but it had a funny feel to it - almost like a synthetic wig. I also found that my styling products didn't work as well, probably because they couldn't penetrate the silicone coating.So is silicone a bad thing? Many hairdressers seem to prefer products that are silicone free, or at least contain only a minimal amount. My hairdresser swears that if you use products containing silicone frequently, that you will experience build-up and other styling products will be less effective. I could see where some hair types might find the coating effect beneficial. If you feel that your hair has a very coarse texture or you are trying to smooth some curls or waves, this might give you more control. I would still recommend that you alternate it with another shampoo to avoid any build-up, and those with fine hair who want extra body should probably give this a pass.A few other things to consider:-This is NOT a sulfate-free shampoo-There is a scent, but I didn't find it overwhelming or distinctly feminine-I think that $13.00 is steep for this product. For a few dollars more you could purchase a salon professional product with higher quality ingredientsBottom Line: Not a bad product, but I wouldn't recommend it for those with fine (or thinning) hair. Contains sulfates and silicone. Not particularly a bargain at the current price of $13.00."
4.00,"It is very hard for me to review most hair products because I am almost 50 and have very long thick but dry and damaged hair. I can say that it didn't suds up much, but that may be a good thing. I feel that it cleaned my hair without having that squeaky clean feeling. I would rather have the soft clean feeling that this shampoo gave."
5.00,"could not find it in drug stores anywhere... Having grey hair is somewhat of a challenge because it can lack the luster that one may have had in their youth... I've been using this brand for some years now and love it... Have tried other brands, but they are not the same... Thank you..."
5.00,"Pantene is the only thing I swear by.. Well specifically their Nature Fusion line. As a swimmer and daily surfer, my hair is always such a frizzy mess that needs a lot of special chlorine-cleansing shampoos and leave-in conditioners to tame. This Nature Fusion Moisture Balance literally saved my frazzled hair and made it smooth and shiny in the first use (I've now been using it for over 5 months and it still gives me great results). I use this shampoo along with Pantene's Smooth conditoner and my thick chestnut brown wavy hair always gets compliments. When I get asked what shampoo I use, I am proud to say its Pantene!"
5.00,"This shampoo is really rich. It cleans with one application, though some people might want to use it again to get all the oil out of your hair. The aroma is very pleasant. It makes your hair very voluminous. This a very nice product!"
5.00,"This was discontinued at one time and I loved it so much that I wrote the manufacturer. I'm so glad they brought it back. It makes your hair shiny and smells good, too!"
5.00,"I love the way my hair feels after I use this- I have used very expensive hair care shampoos and conditioners and this is tops!"
5.00,"I have been using this product for years and highly recommend it to anyone! My breakage is minimal since I've been using this product."
5.00,"I use this every week and absolutely love it!! I would definitely recommend it to persons who want beautiful hair."
4.00,"Very good shampoo. You need to be careful when buying Pantene products, some of them have so much oil in them that my hair looked cleaner before using it and very oily and dirty after using it. This shampoo is good however."
5.00,"Love the shampoo but unable to find it in stores.  Was happy to find it on Amazon.  Will purchase again when needed."
5.00,"I've been using this shampoo, or an earlier version of it, for over 10 years, and each hairdresser that cuts my hair comments at what \"wonderful condition\" my hair is in. As a natural blonde with very fine hair that has to be washed every day, this is a perfect match for me!"
5.00,"Its shampoo but the price was good and I get extra for Christmas time to give to my daughters they do like Pantene"
5.00,"I was so glad to find a shampoo for gray hair, and it also had a companion conditioner. Together, they make my hair silvery gray and soft to the touch."
