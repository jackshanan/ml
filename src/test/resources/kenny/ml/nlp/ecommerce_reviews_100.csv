5.00,"Excellent quality product, I just can't wait for a less expensive generic that performs the same. So far, I haven't found one to compare and this is a little pricey."
5.00,"I absolutely LOVE this stuff. I use it mostly for my sheets, towels and comforters. You can use as much or as little as you want and it just smells wonderful. You walk in your bedroom and it just smells clean! What a great invention! I always buy when I see it on sale! Try it! I think you will love it!"
5.00,"I was used to adding fabrick softeners when the beep went off for a final rinse. Sometime that really got in the way or simply forgot to. Not any more. These downy unstopables are simply adorable and convenient. My work out clothes now really smell fresh as are the towels and bed sheets."
5.00,"I put these inside a new vacuum bag and it made the whole house smell wonderful! I was out of vac. tablets and thought I\"d try this -it works great! it was only about a quarter size of the cap-viola!"
5.00,"I use this for my sheets and towels!! The scent is fresh and lasts for days. My husband likes it too!"
5.00,"Downy smells are awesome. I love this one too. Fun new product to try, I throw it in with my towels, it helps give them the extra boost of sweet smelling clean, that they need."
3.00,"Well, I gave it three stars because it does what it says it does, but I didn't like it at all. To be honest I don't even like perfumes, so I was afraid this stuff would be too strong smelling for me. I love my Downy Fabric Softener and the soft scent it gives my cloths; but this stuff is way too strong for me, even with a little. I saw someone else mention that it makes the towels feel to rough and I totally agree. I really like my towels soft. I usually only use a tad of softener and it's enough to make my towels soft and smell nice without taking away the ability to absorb. But I used twice as much softener because of what I read and I still didn't like the feel of my towels either. I didn't notice it as much on my cloths.                                              If you like the extra scent, this will give you what you're looking for. But it's not for those, like myself, that don't like strong, perfumey smells."
5.00,"My boyfriend is a Hockey Goalie and of course sweats and reaks after his games. This stuff was absolutely amazing with the scent and also stayed smelling good for a while."
4.00,"I bought the Gain version but decided to try these, there is no difference between the two, they both make your clothes smell good. There needs to be a bigger container for these because I use them a lot. They work well for clothes that you work out in."
5.00,"I use this in the wash along with Downey Infusions Honey Flower fabric softner - our laundry smells so good for so long, wish they'd make this scent as a dryer sheet."
5.00,"These unstopables get rid of all the smells on laundry. It works like magic. I wish they were less expensive but they work amazing."
5.00,"The scent last for a long time. This is my favorite of all the unstoppables. Definately purchase again and again."
5.00,"My wife and I both have sensitive skin, so we're forced to use unscented, hypoallergenic detergents for our laundry. Unfortunately, we're both very active, and the freshness of our clothing suffers for it. This product is the perfect answer to our needs. It doesn't take a lot to freshen up a load of laundry, and we haven't had any skin irritation as a result of using it. I highly recommend it!"
4.00,"So easy to use and leaves laundry smelling fresh. Not like some fresheners that smell like cheap perfume. This scent is fabulous! Only negative is product is a bit pricey."
5.00,"I have these on subscribe and save, very good for things like blankets that are not washed very frequently, freshness lasts"
5.00,"I have been looking for something to get the smell out of my Grandsons work clothes .                                              He is a chef. I have tried baking soda, vinigar, and Oxy clean,just to name a few, with out much success.                                                But the Downy Wash scent booster, really worked.                                                                     I use my regular tide with bleach, or Gain -love the Gain), and throw a few pellets in with the beginning wash.                                              Its easy, and I do not measure anything.                                              I still use my dryer sheets,which gives a scent, but I use them so I do not have to iron!                                                                     Even using dryer sheets with the other cleaners, just never got that resturant cooking smell out of his clothes.                                                                     These are little round thin pellets.                                              This seemed expensive but you do not have to use many pellets. Maybe 15 or so.                                                                     I also use this on my clothes and my Husbands with out a problem.                                              The scent stays in the clothes, but it is NOT strong. A nice fresh clean scent.                                                                     I will be buying more.Two thumbs up."
3.00,"These smell great and are convenient because you add them at the beginning of the wash. HOWEVER the beads DO NOT DISSOLVE IN COLD WASHES. After ordering i ended up finding them at the supermarket for a much cheaper price."
4.00,"I love these Unstopables, just wish they were a little less pricey (reason for the 4 stars). Love how they make my laundry smell. I also use regular Downy, may be a little Downy freak, but the scent boosters really add a nice scent. I have tried all 3 scents & love them all. Use different ones for different pieces of laundry."
5.00,"Smells amazing! Love love love this product. Will continue to buy in the future. The smell is incredible and leaves clothes smelling great all day."
3.00,"I had seen this product advertised, and when Amazon made it available through the Vine program, I decided to give it a try. Just a word here: this product does nothing else other than to provide a scent to your laundry. It does not provide extra cleaning power or softening. So, if you - like me - use an additional cleaner to your laundry detergent, you will need to continue to use that product and this. Likewise, if you use a softening product in the wash, you will need to continue to use that as well as using this product. Considering that a person might have to use a laundry detergent, an extra cleaner (such as Oxi-clean, Clorax 2, or bleach), in wash softening rinse, AND this? It just seems like a LOT of products to be putting into the washing machine. It just seems to me it would be more logical if this product combined with some of the others: scent booster along with softening or extra cleaner/whitener/brightener. I could feel as though I'm being economical in some way - and not having to carry additional bottles to the laundry room each week!                                                                     There is no set amount one must use. I suppose this can be good or bad, it's up to the individual. One of the first loads of laundry I tried with this product, I put in a full capful, and the laundry's scent WAS boosted. Oh my, yes! The entire closet was scented from just the few items I had washed! So, caution on using a lot of this product, especially if one is very sensitive to smells. Oh, and the scent does last for a while. Quite a while.                                                                     And speaking of scent, I found a mixed bag result when I lessened the amount of this product and used it with my laundry detergent (which has its own scent) and my in-wash detergent booster (which is also slightly scented), and the Bounce sheets that I use - which are also scented. It seems that none of the scents really came through clearly. Which is probably a good thing! And that is another confusing aspect of this product. Unless one uses all laundry products that have no perfumes, normally all laundrey products have some sort of scent. And those scents don't seem to \"gel\" with this as well - unless you use A LOT of this product, and it becomes overwhelming.                                                                     I had never looked at the price of this product until I received this as an Amazon Vine product to sample. I personally find the price prohibitive, especially as this product only provides a scent and does nothing towards cleaning or softening. I have found coupons for this product, but for only $1 off, which is still way more than this budget shopper can afford. If this product did more than simply scent the laundry, I might be able to make a justification for the added expense, but for now? No, I cannot. Not in these times.                                                                     Even if this product were cheaper, and I were more inclined to purchase it in the future, I would probably use it exclusively for my towels and sheets. Personally, I found the scent too overwhelming for me, with concerns about it clashing with my perfumes (yes, it can be that strong). As to my husband? He really didn't have anything to say, but it's not really a scent a man would enjoy emanating from the shirts he wears when he hangs with his buds.                                                                     I would consider this a slightly luxary item, and if you can afford it and don't mind an extra bottle in your laundry room and like the scent, go for it! I didn't hate the product, and it certainly lived up to what it was supposed to do. I just found it expensive, cumbersome, a bit overwhelming, and sort of something along the lines of a 5th wheel."
5.00,"You sprinkle it in your wash before washing and your clothes smell so good.  I love the smell of fresh clean laundry and this product does the trick everytime!"
5.00,"Our clothes come out smelling wonderful! I use it at every wash to keep towels, bedding & clothes smelling great!"
5.00,"Love it  Love it  Love it!!!  The smell is phenominal!  The smell is definately stronget in the bottle than when the clothes come out of the washer.  I love how my clothes and sheets hold the smell for several days.  I love to walk into my bedroom and it smells so clean and fresh!  I would recommend this product to ALL and I am even having to come here to buy it because I can't find it in the stores anymore  :/"
4.00,"I came to Amazon so I can order Downy Unstopables thinking they would be cheaper (and I go through 2 bottles a week) and see that it costs at least $4 more here than in the store...great stuff but too expensive on Amazon!"
2.00,"I was excited about the Lush scent after purchasing a bottle of the Fresh scent at the store. I can not smell this one like I can the Fresh and I am dissapointed as I was hoping for a lovely lavender-type scent. I tried using more, no luck. I can't really tell if it softens my clothes much but I know it isn't scenting them and that's too bad. If you want a lasting scent, get the Fresh."
5.00,"Considering the new HE washers use less soap, I thought it would be nice to give my laundry a scent boost. Just add a small capful in the machine before the beginning of the wash cycle and it really makes a difference. Will purchase again!"
5.00,"I love this stuff!  I've used Downy for more than twenty years.  From time to time I will use a different brand--one on sale-- but I always come back to Downy.  Now with there Unstoppables line I'm even more addicted.  I was a bit worried that the little pellets might leave spots or oily stains on my clothes but I've used it now for about seven loads and haven't seen one spot!  It's a bit pricey, (you can get it cheaper at your local grocer than here) but I'm hoping to come across coupons for future purchases.  A tip for everyone--a little goes a long way.  The first time I used almost half a cap full and it was way more than I think you need to leave a fresh scent on your laundry."
5.00,"Smells wonderful!! my clothes smell soo good!"
5.00,"I love the downy unstopables. It just takes very little to get and keep your clothes smelling so so good. The scent will last a long time on your clothes after washing. I have even spinkled a small amount of these in my vacuume cleaner. I just wish the price wasn't so darn high. Even though with the price being high, there still worth buying."
5.00,"Makes my clothing smell incredible for days! Even got my parents hooked on using it instead of the regular downy."
5.00,"I LOVE this product so much. it make my laundry smell so good. Quick tip i learned from pinterest, use it in a oil warmer to make your house smell clean and fresh works great!"
5.00,"I love the product and got an excellent price. I love it, I didn't have to go out to get my favorite products when I can get them from Amazon."
5.00,"These are great to use when washing bed spreads, etc. The light scent stays with the fabric for weeks - I love it!"
5.00,"I usually use a Tide brand detergent, which worked really well with Unstopables. That said I haven't been able to find them around where I live, which happens to also be a major city so that's a little off putting when it comes to a long term buy for me. I have been concerned with what people are saying when they are going through over a pound a week though, the Downy Unstopables are quite strong, and I have just sprinkled maybe 1-2oz in with my laundry, and with my regular detergent it's great. Saying that the consumer should use \"a little or a lot\" is way too open to interpretation and you can waste a lot of your product if you don't know how much will actually still increase the smell. Downy needs to decide at what level they want, because if people are using it so quickly and it's sort of expensive, then people won't actually continue to buy it. I love the scent though, it's great and the fact I can just dump it in my HE washer and not worry is nice. Hope to fine it locally though!"
5.00,"We live in the city and have to use laundromats to clean our clothes. The dryers at these places often use super high heat and even with a dryer sheet my clothes can have a slightly burned smell. We started to use these in the wash and I have never gotten the burned smell again, our clothes come out smelling like fresh laundry again! Highly recommend especially for anyone using a laundromat."
5.00,"It leaves my clothing with a really nice scent. Depending on it will last I will buy it again, cause it's not cheap."
2.00,"I was very excited to use this product, despite reading many reviews that it doesn't leave scent in the clothing when using an HE washer. Should have listened! I was expecting my laundry to come out with a fabulous aroma that would last and last...After going through the washer, there was minimal scent, but after drying there was no scent left. I used a scant amount and moved up to a heaping cap full, with no change. It also seems to dull the effects of my fabric softener, my clothing was coming out of the dryer with a lot of static!"
4.00,"I wash two loads per week, and this product has my gym clothes smelling great...right before I destroy them again. haha What keeps me from giving 5 stars is that the product is a bit expensive to use consistently. I have varied the amounts used, and find that my loads need at least 2/3 of the cap. This can wear the bottle out quickly. I only buy when on sale."
2.00,"I tried a free sample of Downy Unstoppables Blue scent, and it worked remarkably! I absolutely loved it! But when my grocery store didn't start carrying it, I turned online to order some. The blue kind was out of stock, so I bought this kind (purple) instead, thinking it would work just as well. It doesn't! It doesn't seem to matter how much I put in, the scent doesn't last past the dryer. Very disappointing, considering how much it costs and doesn't last more than maybe 10 loads anyway. Don't waste your money on the purple kind, wait until the blue stuff is in stock!"
5.00,"Honestly...My wife made this purchase and I (like most men) thought...\"great, another smelly product...waste of money\"...However, this stuff works great...leaves a really fresh smell that actually lasts...Haha...Imagine that...A product that actually does what it says it does...Go figure...If you're on the fence, buy this...you won't be disappointed. Oh...and I do my own laundry...and not sure how much my wife uses...but I throw almost an entire cap-full in the load...And yes, these are front-loading HE friendly..."
5.00,"My boyfriend and I have been using these for about 3 months and they are amazing. Price is a little high, but we've gotten lucky and P&G has had a coupon in the brandsaver every month. First of all, Tide detergent is all we use, as it works best on his work uniforms and before we started using these, the detergent and fabric softener couldn't take the grill smell (he works in a restaurant) out of his aprons and his clothes smelled like grease the very next day. We don't even need to put much in the washer either. I just fill the blue cap until it's to the bottom mark. Makes a great air freshener too! Just dissolve some in very hot water and pour in a trigger sprayer."
5.00,"This make the clothes smelll amazing..and it really does stay..Did a whole load of towels 4 days ago and you cab still smell the fragance in the towels.. A definte recommend!"
5.00,"everything worked...We have already brought the product from a trip to America to Germany and wanted to have it again. The beads make the clothes a long lasting fresh scent. Shipping and communication with the sender worked fine. Thanks"
5.00,"I was able to try this product through Vocalpoint several weeks ago.                                                                     I love the Fresh Scent.  I love alot of fragrance when doing laundry, and this product definitely makes this chore alot more pleasurable.                                                                     Iam able to use this product instead of using fabric softener even tho it's labeled as a scent booster.  I can always count on Downy to make a great product, and this one  definitely falls into that category.                                                                     I want to try the other scent too.  I just wish it came in a larger size than 13.2 ounces, because I would definitely buy it.                                                                     I really appreciate Vocalpoint allowing me to test this product."
4.00,"Downy Unstopables commercials have been popping up all over. So much so that I've been curious as to whether the fragrance truly is unstoppable. If you've not seen the advertisements, this product is simply a scent booster for your laundry. You can throw in a little or a lot, depending on your preference. At the current price of $11.01, my choice was to use a little. True, Amazon currently has a $2 off coupon and the Lush scent is a buck cheaper, but that's still a steep price to make laundry smell better.                                                                     The fresh scent aroma, which smells absolutely wonderful, can be detected prior to opening up the bottle. Made me want to wash clothes right away. Depending on how much used, one bottle can boost the smell of about ten to twelve loads of clothes. Though the smell diminishes over time, my clothes retained the fragrance after three weeks of being in the closet. The smell would have lasted longer if I'd left them in there.                                                                     My only complaint is the price, but the product can be versatile. Put some in a knee high or tie it up in a fine netting material and you can have an aromatic sachet. It's a good way to make your entire closet smell fresh."
3.00,"It isn't that bad a little bit goes a long way. The unfortunate thing is that im kind of tired of the scent and i still have over half a bottle of it left."
1.00,"Sorry, but this stuff has such a bad smell that I had to wash my cloths again - minus the Unstopables."
5.00,"What can I say I love these things. Kinda addicted to them. My husband even demands that I keep using them. You can walk in the bedrooms and the smell is just awesome. The 2 guestrooms smell great for months and that keeps me from washing linens ever week on beds not used. Your clothes will love you and you will love your clothes. Just one hint don't use detergents or softener with scent and they work better."
2.00,"I have used up a whole bottle of Downy Unstopables. At first I thought it was ok, since it added some extra scent. But honestly, you get that from your laundry detergent and/or fabric softener, so realistically there is no reason to add yet another product and more money to the laundry.The biggest problem I have with it is that it seems like it kills the fabric softener. I have noticed my towels are stiffer and rough. It is worse than not using any fabric softener at all. Even when I don't use softener, my towels are never this rough feeling.I don't use alot of crystals at all either. I use enough to cover the bottom of the lid/cap that you use for dispensing. That is really all you need in order to add a decent amount of scent. So, the roughness is not due to using too much of the Unstopables.My other big complaint is that I can tell a huge difference in the dark loads - they attract more lint and hair. All loads have more static cling as well when using the Unstopables, but the dark loads are terrible.This product just isn't worth it for me in the long run. It adds extra unnecessary cost to the laundry. I do at least 2 loads a day, every day. Most days I have more loads. With 3 teens in sports and cheeleading, laundry is a major part of my day. I do not need it to cost more money. I get a nice amount of scent from the fabric softener and detergent, so I will stick with those and occasional stain pre treaters of course."
5.00,"great smell! I would buy this one again! If I can find it in my local store. I'm anxious to try the other scents."

2.00,"I loved the scent of this, it was on sale & I had a coupon. I'd read reviews about the scent being very strong so used in sparingly in the first load. Nothing. Tried it again and filled the entire cap, as I was doing a big load. Some items had a light pleasant fragrance, others none at all. It seemed that only the all cotton items carried the scent. However it would be far to expensive, in my opinion, to justify using it regularly. And after a few hours, the scent is definitely fading. Oh well! It was fun to try it."
2.00,"First of all, let me say I was so excited to try this! Who doesn't like good smelling laundry? I love the smell of the \"Fresh Scent\" unstopables.I thought the best way to try this out would be using it on blankets, towels and sheets. In the directions it states \"use as little or as much as you want\" so I decided to try it both ways. I started off using a little amount and thought maybe this was why the smell didn't last very long. Then I used a lot, I was so disappointed, the smell only lasted a couple of days also! My Downy fabric softener lasts longer than this!!! I won't be buying this product again, I will be sticking to my Tide laundry detergent and Downy fabric softener."
2.00,"Other than \"unstopables\" not being an actual word, this product has another problem:  who on earth is going to pay a premium - a large premium - for extra perfume for their clothes?  I won't be.                                                                     Basically, this product is a bunch of waxy-feeling granules that you add to your washing machine.  Water breaks it down, releasing its perfume, and there you have it - scented clothes.  It does the job, and the perfume is pleasant-enough smelling.                                                                     But then again, both my detergent and fabric softener also smell fine.  If I use these in combination, I end up with three different perfumes vying for supremacy, leading to a weird concoction of aromas that...shouldn't be.  Remove one (or two) of those perfumes, and the clothes are back to smelling how you figured they were.                                                                     Perhaps if you use unscented detergent and fabric softener (does that even exist?), and use this just because you fell in love with the scent, it would make sense.  In the real world, however, this product doesn't make any sense at all.  And while I received my container of it free of charge, I hope that the list price is actually a 3 or 4 pack, because not only is this nothing special (and an awkward product), but it's also quite expensive.  I won't be buying it or using it again, once this container is used up."

2.00,"I've been using this for weeks now, switching from the purple to the blue. It smells wonderful in the wash, but I don't find the scent to be lasting much after the dryer except on towels. I would expect my entire closet should be wafting with the wonderful scent by now, having washed nearly all my clothing in it, but alas. . . no. I had hoped my bed linens would retain the scent after making the bed, but by the time I climb into bed. . . not so much and certainly nothing after a day or so. Over priced and over-rated in my opinion and just a gimmicky thing. Perhaps if my washer and dryer were on the main floor, I would have the added benefit of fragrancing my home as I did the wash, but unfortunately, they're in the basement. Very disappointed. Will have to try the Gain product."
2.00,"I added 1 capfull in my first load and 2 capfuls in my second load and I really can't say it does any better than my laundry soap and dryer sheets. How many capfuls or how much do I have to use to make it work???"
2.00,"I just don't see the point in buying something like this. I used it, but since I already use fabric softener, boosting the scent is simply overkill and a waste of money."
1.00,"I had wanted to try this to see if it would help my sheets stay nicely scented longer. I used a small amount in my first load-nothing. Used half a cap in the second-still nothing. I did not want to spend $10 or whatever for the large bottle and had gotten a coupon and used it to purchase what they called a trial size bottle. Still paid over $5 for it even with the coupon. I am so glad I did not spend more. Total waste of money. No scent right from the dryer let alone after sitting for weeks in storage. How on earth do they get away with advertising that it ha this wonderful long lasting scent? lesson learned"
2.00,"I really like the smell of the Downy Unstopables. But what really are they for? I use Tide or Gain and my laundry always smells nice. I just don't know why you would need to add one more thing on top of detergent and softener."
1.00,"Not a Bargain! It is cheaper to buy 4 individual containers. Just order the 4 individuals and save about ten dollars."
1.00,"I purchased the Lush scent of this product. I use Tide Coldwater He liquid detergent and                                              Downy fabric softener.  I added a capful of Unstopables as directed and after machine                                              drying, there was absolutely no scent of Lush.  The only way that the scent would come                                              through would be if you used unscented detergent and unscented or no fabric softener.                                              Otherwise, these Unstopables are a waste of money.                                                                     I've often wondered, if Tide is the highest rated, most advertised, and most expensive                                              detergent, why does Tide market so many additional additives which add considerably to                                              the cost of each washload?  If Tide detergent is as good as they say it is then we                                              shouldn't need anything else except fabric softener which I use sparingly mainly to eliminate                                              static cling.  Hint:  Never use fabric softener on towels as it reduces their absorbency.                                              Fabric softener is oil-based and puts a coating on fabrics.  This is helpful on clothing                                              because it helps with stain removal and eliminates static.  However, on any type                                              of towel - bath towels, hand towels, kitchen towels, it greatly reduces their absorbency                                              and drying time.  And of course, NEVER use fabric softener on microfiber cloths - it ruins them."
2.00,"I tried the one with a purple lid. Initially I was super excited because as weird as it is, I love doing laundry. I like the way the purple one smells - sort of heady and musky with a splash of floral. Green is definately \"clean\".                                                                     The perk is that it made my entire apartment smell like the beads. The downfall is that it really didn't stay on anything I washed. I followed the directions exactly and it didn't matter what kind of water I used or how much...the scent just isn't strong. I also tried without a fabric softener and dryer sheets and it's still very weak. Once the items were folded and put away,it was gone.                                                                     I haven't bought anymore - it's expensive for a smell that doesn't stay. I would rather use dryer sheets.                                                                     I have a very sensitive sense of smell so I can be certain it's very weak."
1.00,"I added this to a batch of homemade laundry detergent -- somewhat reluctantly as I usually don't go for strong chemical scents. Over a few washes I liked the results -- you can clearly tell by smell what loads of laundry are washed and which are not.                                                                     Then I developed a rash -- atopic dermatitis -- traceable to the Unstopables -- the only significant change in my routine. Now I nickname them Downy Untouchables. Googling I quickly found many other reports of this kind of problem.                                                                     I'll retired the beads to towels and sheets only and hope that works -- no more for my clothes."
2.00,"for starters, This is not a fabric softener. Downy unstoppables are an in-wash scent booster                                                                     They look like pieces of Nerds candy that you add to the start of your load to provide a long lasting scent.                                                                     While it smells great and does provide a nice fresh scent, it doesn't last. I used it on a blanket. the smell wore off after just 2 days. so I really wouldn't consider it \"lasting\". I tried using more the 2nd time I washed my blanket - same.                                                                     I've had bounce dryer sheets &amp; febreeze's freshness last a lot longer. so I can't really recommend this."
2.00,"I was so excited to try these as I absolutely LOVE Downy Unstopables and wish they had more scents. So when I saw this I couldn't wait to try it. I am a seasonal person and use the blue/green ones and the pink ones in the spring and summer. In the fall and winter I like heavier scents so I use the light pink (lush?) and the purple. These smell very good, however it doesn't work nearly as well as they other unstopables do. You can barely smell it in your clothes at all. I was extremely disappointed. So instead of using them in my clothes I put a few in my vacuum to help make the house smell less like kids and animals. In my opinion, the purple smells just as good, is stronger and lasts much longer."
2.00,"Did not like the smell of this product, plus I found a much cheaper brand that smells better, and lasts longer on clothes."
2.00,"This product destroyed my comforter.  It didn't dissolve like it was suppose to and now my comforter is all marked up and can't be fixed.  I used this on my clothes and towels without a problem but it attacked my bedding with a vengeance.  I wanted to like this product but can't after that."
1.00,"Let me start off by saying, I really wanted to love this product. I used it first on my sheets, comforter and towels. The smell is heavenly! Unfortunately, I developed such a bad rash almost instantly, that I had to see a doctor. An unstoppable, itchy, red, blotchy, mess. My skin just does NOT like this product. Very sad. Not sure what they put in it that caused me to have such a bad reaction, but if you are the type to be sensitive to perfumes, dyes and fragrance even in the slightest bit, do NOT use this product. I repeat, do not use this product."
1.00,"Dont really get this crap It;s a lot of money for something that does next to nothing !!! Puh-lease get lost"
2.00,"This is supposed to be a scent booster that goes directly into your washing machine with your dirty laundry and laundry detergent. As long as you have a great smelling laundry detergent and fabric softener there is really no need to use this. I tired it without using the fabric softener sheets after the end of a wash and the scent did not last very long. Drying my clothes with my bounce sheets actually last a lot longer than this did. Save your money and get a really nice good laundry detergent that you like the smell of and fabric softener/sheets."
1.00,"Does anyone care about buying a misspelled product? There doesn't seem to be a pun, so it looks more like a lot of quality control went by the wayside and if they can't even spell a word right on their packaging, are they being conscientious about what goes inside?"
1.00,"I bought this product after watching it's very nice commercial but it came out sooooooooo bad. I don't recommend this product to anyone because it is expensive as well doesn't work at all. It doesn't smell anything. I am highly disappointed."
2.00,"I enjoy Downy products and like a fresh light fragrance in my wash -  this Downy Unstoppable Fresh Scent Booster was overpowering and over the top for me."
1.00,"I was looking and just to let you know it is cheaper at walmart $5.99 just alittle info so go to walmart or Publix it is also $5.99"
1.00,"I was highly disappointed, I couldn't smell anything, I smelled more when I used Bounce dryer sheets. I used a full cup as well, and the smell was only there when wet, once dry, the scent went away. I am editing this because apparently the blue seems to work and smell more and better than the purple...haven't tried the blue yet though...as for the Lavender...couldn't smell a thing."
1.00,"SMELL IS SO LIGHT USE AN ENTIRE BOTTLE PER WASH AND DO NOT EXPECT IT TO LAST FOR ANY AMOUNT OF TIME. PAYING THIS KIND OF PRICE FOR A PRETTY BOTTLE IS NOT ENTERTAINING."
1.00,"I've purchased this from the store and in all honesty, I cannot say that this product is at all worth the money -$6.97 large, $4.97 small/med (called \"Tester). I've tested it using a little (as the bottle says) to double the amount (over what the bottle says) to half a bottle use, then in the last experiment, to whole bottle use. The Experiment: As for washing/drying: (cold water in washer, high heat in dryer) - during the experiment, laundry deg without perfumes used. No dryer sheets or other perfumes were used. Experiment did over a course of 2 weekends. With 3 to 4 medium loads of laundry each for 3 adults. Usual clothes, nothing outlandish. I used $4.97 (tester) for 1st weekend, then $6.97 start of 2nd weekend, then another $6.97 for last (had a coupon) - two different smells. Washer and dryer are both 3 years old, but not HE. Reason: I wanted to see if it really did as it claimed, because to me, just looking at it, it wouldn't, without using other products alongside it. 1st weekend) Using the first small amount as the bottle says (half cap), in it's directions, did nothing for the clothes but left a small hint, probably not even noticeable by some, once washed. I was used to the smell while moving the clothes to the dryer, so it was gone before I even started the dry cycle. Once fully dried, the smell was gone. 1st weekend) Using the first small amount then a little more, such as half of the first small amount (almost full cap, but not completely), will do the same thing as the first. Leave a small hint of smell. Once dried, it's gone. 1st weekend) Using double the amount as the first (one whole cap full then half cap) left the smell in the clothes once washed, but once dried, nothing, it was gone. Completely. 2nd weekend) Using one whole cap, plus another in the wash (2 caps full), left smell long enough to move to dryer, but once dried, nothing, once again. Downy Unstopables In Wash Fresh Scent Booster 13.2 Oz New bottle - used half. 2nd weekend) Using half the bottle in the wash, leaves smell on clothes. Left some white hue on some clothes. Not all of the product was dissolved in the washer. Found some on clothes and in the washer itself. Once dried, left a hint. Downy Unstopables In Wash Spring Scent Booster Laundry Fabric Softener, 13.2 Ounce New bottle - used full bottle. 2nd weekend) Left clothes smelling like bottle fragrance once washed, but also left a small white cloud hue on some. Came off with wet wash cloth or another washing, if it were bad (only had 2 that were bad). Only noticeable on non-white items. Just like before, some of the product didn't get dissolved in the water. Some was found on stick on the clothes and in bottom of washer, either laying there or stick to the sides. Had some hint of smell once dried. Smell lasted about 25 to 30 minutes while folding. Checked to see if towels were still smelling the next day about an hour or so after, had a hint, but didn't last long as the bottle claims, which is until your next wash. Smell was gone by the next day. Did not even leave the closet smelling nice, like when I use Bounce. My conclusion: The product smells really nice (all do; depending on your senses) while still in the bottle. I believe they'd work well for making your closet, bathroom or any small place smell nice, for a couple of hours - not days. It does not remove odors. To get any hint of smell after wash and dry, you literally will have to do what Downy is marketing, which is \"mix and match scents\" and products - which to me, is a lot to spend every time you do laundry. So all in all, a waste of money by itself. You would literally have to purchase Tide deg (owned by P&G), Unstopables (owned by P&G), Downy fabric softener (owned by P&G) and then Downy/Bounce dryer sheets (owned by P&G) for the smell to stick around longer, and the smells would have to \"match\". Hope my experiment helped someone :) a little side note.. their spelling of Unstopables; is just... *sigh*"
1.00,"I stopped using this product once I started having skin irritations resulting from my my clothes in this product. Not recommended."
1.00,"used the unstopables in my HE washer and they did not dissolve and left little grease looking spots on my comforter and pillow cases. Will not be using this again!"
1.00,"The tiny beads do not all dissolved. I found pieces attached to my clothing, especially sweaters. I prefer the liquid vesion."
1.00,"Save your money....doesn't make your clothes smell any better than just using regular ole fabric softener. I tried adding more...then less..results were still the same. Bah humbug."
1.00,"If it turns out you are allergic to it, you can break out in hives and/or an itchy rash! Both my son and I broke out after using this in our wash. Never again!"
2.00,"This applies to the lush scent. I may try the fresh scent after reading some glowing reviews.                                              I loved the scent of this, it was on sale &amp; I had a coupon. I'd read reviews about the scent being very strong so used in sparingly in the first load. Nothing. Tried it again and filled the entire cap, as I was doing a big load. Some items had a light pleasant fragrance, others none at all. It seemed that only the all cotton items carried the scent. However it would be far too expensive for me to use it regularly. And after a few hours, the scent is definitely fading. I folded a few t shirts to see if any scent remains in a week or two. It was fun to try it and I may use it on towels and sheets sometimes for a treat.                                              Update: A very mild scent after a week."
2.00,"Thought I would give this a try and frankly I couldn't notice a difference. I prefer just using the fabric softener. Just something else to spend your money on."
1.00,"(note: Even if it had worked exceptionally well, the product is still extremely expensive)"
2.00,"I used the fresh scent in my towels. I was really impressed while it was washing. It made my whole house smell clean. However, it turned my towels blotchy blue in color. I have a HE washer that automatically does an extra rinse and I as well turned on another rinse since I am sometimes sensative to dyes and scents, so I know rinsing was NOT the issue. I would NOT recommend putting this in with clothes."
2.00,"After hearing so much about this product, I decided to go ahead and give it a try. Who doesn't love to smell the fresh scent of laundry long after the clothes have been washed? Well, I wasn't thrilled with the directions (to use as little or as much as you want). I like being told what works and what doesn't. Otherwise, I'm worried I'll overdo it and waste the product or underdo and waste the product. Well, I tried several different loads of laundry with several different amounts of product in the cup and, while they all have a nice scent, I'm not really sure it smells any better than other products I've used.                                              I felt like this was a bit of a waste of money for me when my other products (Gain especially) do the exact same thing. I'm usually fairly easily amused, but I also really like not wasting money on products that aren't necessary in addition to what you already use."
1.00,"I got the bright idea to try this new product. I had a terrible allergic reaction that took me two weeks to figure out that it was from the Downy Unstopables. So I had re-wash all my clothes again, and I have had no problems since. So if you find yourself breaking out in welts that are very red and itchy and your using the Downy stop right away."
2.00,"Although it bears the Downy name, this product is not a fabric softener, it is simply a \"scent booster\". Not worth the cost just for the scent, in my opinion."
2.00,"It cleans well but I find the scent doesn't last long and it doesn't smell the same as the regular unstopables scent."
1.00,"I got this mainly to use with sheets, towels, and my workout clothes. once home, I opened it and sniffed- not much of a scent, but I figured maybe it was released in the water. Washed the first load using about half a cap full of the product. I barely noticed the scent when I opened the washer at the end of the cycle. Once the sheets were dry...nothing. Tried it again, this time using a whole cap full of the pink pellets. Same thing again. No scent on the towels, at all! It's not just me- my husband can't smell it, either. This is a waste of money. I won't be buying this again and I'll certainly be wary of Downy products."
2.00,"When I first tried this product on my sheets I LOVED LOVED LOVED it!! My entire bedroom smelled AWSOME! The second time it was ok too on my towels, but thereafter the scent all but vanished. I use an HE front loader washer and at this point I really smell nothing different in my clothes/sheets even if I were to dump half the bottle in there! WHY? Is there some buildup going on in there that doesn't give me that awesome scent anymore? Now I just smell it very faintly but believe me it is NOTHING like it was at first. Anyone know why? I'd really LOVE to get that scent back. I've tried cleaning my machine as well numerous times with no change, I still can't hardly smell it anymore. The two stars is only because it was GREAT for the first couple washes, but I won't spend that kind of money anymore since it doesn't work for me anymore."
1.00,"Let me start off by saying, I really wanted to love this product. I used it first on my sheets, comforter and towels. The smell is heavenly! Unfortunately, I developed such a bad rash almost instantly, that I had to see a doctor. Itchy, red, blotchy, mess. My skin just does NOT like this product. Very sad. Not sure what they put in it that caused me to have such a bad reaction, but if you are the type to be sensitive to perfumes, dyes and fragrance even in the slightest bit, do NOT use this product. I repeat, do not use this product."
1.00,"The 170 load bottle with the spout is less than $30 at the grocery store! Even if you do subscribe and save you're still spending $40.75 for only 144 loads. Go to ANY grocery store and just buy the giant bottle, it will save you a lot of money! :)"
1.00,"This product made me break out into hives. Can't use it I think my husband brought on sale. Never again"
