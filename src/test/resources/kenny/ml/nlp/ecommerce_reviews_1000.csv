5.00,"Excellent quality product, I just can't wait for a less expensive generic that performs the same. So far, I haven't found one to compare and this is a little pricey."
5.00,"I absolutely LOVE this stuff. I use it mostly for my sheets, towels and comforters. You can use as much or as little as you want and it just smells wonderful. You walk in your bedroom and it just smells clean! What a great invention! I always buy when I see it on sale! Try it! I think you will love it!"
5.00,"I was used to adding fabrick softeners when the beep went off for a final rinse. Sometime that really got in the way or simply forgot to. Not any more. These downy unstopables are simply adorable and convenient. My work out clothes now really smell fresh as are the towels and bed sheets."
5.00,"I put these inside a new vacuum bag and it made the whole house smell wonderful! I was out of vac. tablets and thought I\"d try this -it works great! it was only about a quarter size of the cap-viola!"
5.00,"I use this for my sheets and towels!! The scent is fresh and lasts for days. My husband likes it too!"
5.00,"Downy smells are awesome. I love this one too. Fun new product to try, I throw it in with my towels, it helps give them the extra boost of sweet smelling clean, that they need."
3.00,"Well, I gave it three stars because it does what it says it does, but I didn't like it at all. To be honest I don't even like perfumes, so I was afraid this stuff would be too strong smelling for me. I love my Downy Fabric Softener and the soft scent it gives my cloths; but this stuff is way too strong for me, even with a little. I saw someone else mention that it makes the towels feel to rough and I totally agree. I really like my towels soft. I usually only use a tad of softener and it's enough to make my towels soft and smell nice without taking away the ability to absorb. But I used twice as much softener because of what I read and I still didn't like the feel of my towels either. I didn't notice it as much on my cloths.                                              If you like the extra scent, this will give you what you're looking for. But it's not for those, like myself, that don't like strong, perfumey smells."
5.00,"My boyfriend is a Hockey Goalie and of course sweats and reaks after his games. This stuff was absolutely amazing with the scent and also stayed smelling good for a while."
4.00,"I bought the Gain version but decided to try these, there is no difference between the two, they both make your clothes smell good. There needs to be a bigger container for these because I use them a lot. They work well for clothes that you work out in."
5.00,"I use this in the wash along with Downey Infusions Honey Flower fabric softner - our laundry smells so good for so long, wish they'd make this scent as a dryer sheet."
5.00,"These unstopables get rid of all the smells on laundry. It works like magic. I wish they were less expensive but they work amazing."
5.00,"The scent last for a long time. This is my favorite of all the unstoppables. Definately purchase again and again."
5.00,"My wife and I both have sensitive skin, so we're forced to use unscented, hypoallergenic detergents for our laundry. Unfortunately, we're both very active, and the freshness of our clothing suffers for it. This product is the perfect answer to our needs. It doesn't take a lot to freshen up a load of laundry, and we haven't had any skin irritation as a result of using it. I highly recommend it!"
4.00,"So easy to use and leaves laundry smelling fresh. Not like some fresheners that smell like cheap perfume. This scent is fabulous! Only negative is product is a bit pricey."
5.00,"I have these on subscribe and save, very good for things like blankets that are not washed very frequently, freshness lasts"
5.00,"I have been looking for something to get the smell out of my Grandsons work clothes .                                              He is a chef. I have tried baking soda, vinigar, and Oxy clean,just to name a few, with out much success.                                                But the Downy Wash scent booster, really worked.                                                                     I use my regular tide with bleach, or Gain -love the Gain), and throw a few pellets in with the beginning wash.                                              Its easy, and I do not measure anything.                                              I still use my dryer sheets,which gives a scent, but I use them so I do not have to iron!                                                                     Even using dryer sheets with the other cleaners, just never got that resturant cooking smell out of his clothes.                                                                     These are little round thin pellets.                                              This seemed expensive but you do not have to use many pellets. Maybe 15 or so.                                                                     I also use this on my clothes and my Husbands with out a problem.                                              The scent stays in the clothes, but it is NOT strong. A nice fresh clean scent.                                                                     I will be buying more.Two thumbs up."
3.00,"These smell great and are convenient because you add them at the beginning of the wash. HOWEVER the beads DO NOT DISSOLVE IN COLD WASHES. After ordering i ended up finding them at the supermarket for a much cheaper price."
4.00,"I love these Unstopables, just wish they were a little less pricey (reason for the 4 stars). Love how they make my laundry smell. I also use regular Downy, may be a little Downy freak, but the scent boosters really add a nice scent. I have tried all 3 scents & love them all. Use different ones for different pieces of laundry."
5.00,"Smells amazing! Love love love this product. Will continue to buy in the future. The smell is incredible and leaves clothes smelling great all day."
3.00,"I had seen this product advertised, and when Amazon made it available through the Vine program, I decided to give it a try. Just a word here: this product does nothing else other than to provide a scent to your laundry. It does not provide extra cleaning power or softening. So, if you - like me - use an additional cleaner to your laundry detergent, you will need to continue to use that product and this. Likewise, if you use a softening product in the wash, you will need to continue to use that as well as using this product. Considering that a person might have to use a laundry detergent, an extra cleaner (such as Oxi-clean, Clorax 2, or bleach), in wash softening rinse, AND this? It just seems like a LOT of products to be putting into the washing machine. It just seems to me it would be more logical if this product combined with some of the others: scent booster along with softening or extra cleaner/whitener/brightener. I could feel as though I'm being economical in some way - and not having to carry additional bottles to the laundry room each week!                                                                     There is no set amount one must use. I suppose this can be good or bad, it's up to the individual. One of the first loads of laundry I tried with this product, I put in a full capful, and the laundry's scent WAS boosted. Oh my, yes! The entire closet was scented from just the few items I had washed! So, caution on using a lot of this product, especially if one is very sensitive to smells. Oh, and the scent does last for a while. Quite a while.                                                                     And speaking of scent, I found a mixed bag result when I lessened the amount of this product and used it with my laundry detergent (which has its own scent) and my in-wash detergent booster (which is also slightly scented), and the Bounce sheets that I use - which are also scented. It seems that none of the scents really came through clearly. Which is probably a good thing! And that is another confusing aspect of this product. Unless one uses all laundry products that have no perfumes, normally all laundrey products have some sort of scent. And those scents don't seem to \"gel\" with this as well - unless you use A LOT of this product, and it becomes overwhelming.                                                                     I had never looked at the price of this product until I received this as an Amazon Vine product to sample. I personally find the price prohibitive, especially as this product only provides a scent and does nothing towards cleaning or softening. I have found coupons for this product, but for only $1 off, which is still way more than this budget shopper can afford. If this product did more than simply scent the laundry, I might be able to make a justification for the added expense, but for now? No, I cannot. Not in these times.                                                                     Even if this product were cheaper, and I were more inclined to purchase it in the future, I would probably use it exclusively for my towels and sheets. Personally, I found the scent too overwhelming for me, with concerns about it clashing with my perfumes (yes, it can be that strong). As to my husband? He really didn't have anything to say, but it's not really a scent a man would enjoy emanating from the shirts he wears when he hangs with his buds.                                                                     I would consider this a slightly luxary item, and if you can afford it and don't mind an extra bottle in your laundry room and like the scent, go for it! I didn't hate the product, and it certainly lived up to what it was supposed to do. I just found it expensive, cumbersome, a bit overwhelming, and sort of something along the lines of a 5th wheel."
5.00,"You sprinkle it in your wash before washing and your clothes smell so good.  I love the smell of fresh clean laundry and this product does the trick everytime!"
5.00,"Our clothes come out smelling wonderful! I use it at every wash to keep towels, bedding & clothes smelling great!"
5.00,"Love it  Love it  Love it!!!  The smell is phenominal!  The smell is definately stronget in the bottle than when the clothes come out of the washer.  I love how my clothes and sheets hold the smell for several days.  I love to walk into my bedroom and it smells so clean and fresh!  I would recommend this product to ALL and I am even having to come here to buy it because I can't find it in the stores anymore  :/"
4.00,"I came to Amazon so I can order Downy Unstopables thinking they would be cheaper (and I go through 2 bottles a week) and see that it costs at least $4 more here than in the store...great stuff but too expensive on Amazon!"
2.00,"I was excited about the Lush scent after purchasing a bottle of the Fresh scent at the store. I can not smell this one like I can the Fresh and I am dissapointed as I was hoping for a lovely lavender-type scent. I tried using more, no luck. I can't really tell if it softens my clothes much but I know it isn't scenting them and that's too bad. If you want a lasting scent, get the Fresh."
5.00,"Considering the new HE washers use less soap, I thought it would be nice to give my laundry a scent boost. Just add a small capful in the machine before the beginning of the wash cycle and it really makes a difference. Will purchase again!"
5.00,"I love this stuff!  I've used Downy for more than twenty years.  From time to time I will use a different brand--one on sale-- but I always come back to Downy.  Now with there Unstoppables line I'm even more addicted.  I was a bit worried that the little pellets might leave spots or oily stains on my clothes but I've used it now for about seven loads and haven't seen one spot!  It's a bit pricey, (you can get it cheaper at your local grocer than here) but I'm hoping to come across coupons for future purchases.  A tip for everyone--a little goes a long way.  The first time I used almost half a cap full and it was way more than I think you need to leave a fresh scent on your laundry."
5.00,"Smells wonderful!! my clothes smell soo good!"
5.00,"I love the downy unstopables. It just takes very little to get and keep your clothes smelling so so good. The scent will last a long time on your clothes after washing. I have even spinkled a small amount of these in my vacuume cleaner. I just wish the price wasn't so darn high. Even though with the price being high, there still worth buying."
5.00,"Makes my clothing smell incredible for days! Even got my parents hooked on using it instead of the regular downy."
5.00,"I LOVE this product so much. it make my laundry smell so good. Quick tip i learned from pinterest, use it in a oil warmer to make your house smell clean and fresh works great!"
5.00,"I love the product and got an excellent price. I love it, I didn't have to go out to get my favorite products when I can get them from Amazon."
5.00,"These are great to use when washing bed spreads, etc. The light scent stays with the fabric for weeks - I love it!"
5.00,"I usually use a Tide brand detergent, which worked really well with Unstopables. That said I haven't been able to find them around where I live, which happens to also be a major city so that's a little off putting when it comes to a long term buy for me. I have been concerned with what people are saying when they are going through over a pound a week though, the Downy Unstopables are quite strong, and I have just sprinkled maybe 1-2oz in with my laundry, and with my regular detergent it's great. Saying that the consumer should use \"a little or a lot\" is way too open to interpretation and you can waste a lot of your product if you don't know how much will actually still increase the smell. Downy needs to decide at what level they want, because if people are using it so quickly and it's sort of expensive, then people won't actually continue to buy it. I love the scent though, it's great and the fact I can just dump it in my HE washer and not worry is nice. Hope to fine it locally though!"
5.00,"We live in the city and have to use laundromats to clean our clothes. The dryers at these places often use super high heat and even with a dryer sheet my clothes can have a slightly burned smell. We started to use these in the wash and I have never gotten the burned smell again, our clothes come out smelling like fresh laundry again! Highly recommend especially for anyone using a laundromat."
5.00,"It leaves my clothing with a really nice scent. Depending on it will last I will buy it again, cause it's not cheap."
2.00,"I was very excited to use this product, despite reading many reviews that it doesn't leave scent in the clothing when using an HE washer. Should have listened! I was expecting my laundry to come out with a fabulous aroma that would last and last...After going through the washer, there was minimal scent, but after drying there was no scent left. I used a scant amount and moved up to a heaping cap full, with no change. It also seems to dull the effects of my fabric softener, my clothing was coming out of the dryer with a lot of static!"
4.00,"I wash two loads per week, and this product has my gym clothes smelling great...right before I destroy them again. haha What keeps me from giving 5 stars is that the product is a bit expensive to use consistently. I have varied the amounts used, and find that my loads need at least 2/3 of the cap. This can wear the bottle out quickly. I only buy when on sale."
2.00,"I tried a free sample of Downy Unstoppables Blue scent, and it worked remarkably! I absolutely loved it! But when my grocery store didn't start carrying it, I turned online to order some. The blue kind was out of stock, so I bought this kind (purple) instead, thinking it would work just as well. It doesn't! It doesn't seem to matter how much I put in, the scent doesn't last past the dryer. Very disappointing, considering how much it costs and doesn't last more than maybe 10 loads anyway. Don't waste your money on the purple kind, wait until the blue stuff is in stock!"
5.00,"Honestly...My wife made this purchase and I (like most men) thought...\"great, another smelly product...waste of money\"...However, this stuff works great...leaves a really fresh smell that actually lasts...Haha...Imagine that...A product that actually does what it says it does...Go figure...If you're on the fence, buy this...you won't be disappointed. Oh...and I do my own laundry...and not sure how much my wife uses...but I throw almost an entire cap-full in the load...And yes, these are front-loading HE friendly..."
5.00,"My boyfriend and I have been using these for about 3 months and they are amazing. Price is a little high, but we've gotten lucky and P&G has had a coupon in the brandsaver every month. First of all, Tide detergent is all we use, as it works best on his work uniforms and before we started using these, the detergent and fabric softener couldn't take the grill smell (he works in a restaurant) out of his aprons and his clothes smelled like grease the very next day. We don't even need to put much in the washer either. I just fill the blue cap until it's to the bottom mark. Makes a great air freshener too! Just dissolve some in very hot water and pour in a trigger sprayer."
5.00,"This make the clothes smelll amazing..and it really does stay..Did a whole load of towels 4 days ago and you cab still smell the fragance in the towels.. A definte recommend!"
5.00,"everything worked...We have already brought the product from a trip to America to Germany and wanted to have it again. The beads make the clothes a long lasting fresh scent. Shipping and communication with the sender worked fine. Thanks"
5.00,"I was able to try this product through Vocalpoint several weeks ago.                                                                     I love the Fresh Scent.  I love alot of fragrance when doing laundry, and this product definitely makes this chore alot more pleasurable.                                                                     Iam able to use this product instead of using fabric softener even tho it's labeled as a scent booster.  I can always count on Downy to make a great product, and this one  definitely falls into that category.                                                                     I want to try the other scent too.  I just wish it came in a larger size than 13.2 ounces, because I would definitely buy it.                                                                     I really appreciate Vocalpoint allowing me to test this product."
4.00,"Downy Unstopables commercials have been popping up all over. So much so that I've been curious as to whether the fragrance truly is unstoppable. If you've not seen the advertisements, this product is simply a scent booster for your laundry. You can throw in a little or a lot, depending on your preference. At the current price of $11.01, my choice was to use a little. True, Amazon currently has a $2 off coupon and the Lush scent is a buck cheaper, but that's still a steep price to make laundry smell better.                                                                     The fresh scent aroma, which smells absolutely wonderful, can be detected prior to opening up the bottle. Made me want to wash clothes right away. Depending on how much used, one bottle can boost the smell of about ten to twelve loads of clothes. Though the smell diminishes over time, my clothes retained the fragrance after three weeks of being in the closet. The smell would have lasted longer if I'd left them in there.                                                                     My only complaint is the price, but the product can be versatile. Put some in a knee high or tie it up in a fine netting material and you can have an aromatic sachet. It's a good way to make your entire closet smell fresh."
3.00,"It isn't that bad a little bit goes a long way. The unfortunate thing is that im kind of tired of the scent and i still have over half a bottle of it left."
1.00,"Sorry, but this stuff has such a bad smell that I had to wash my cloths again - minus the Unstopables."
5.00,"What can I say I love these things. Kinda addicted to them. My husband even demands that I keep using them. You can walk in the bedrooms and the smell is just awesome. The 2 guestrooms smell great for months and that keeps me from washing linens ever week on beds not used. Your clothes will love you and you will love your clothes. Just one hint don't use detergents or softener with scent and they work better."
2.00,"I have used up a whole bottle of Downy Unstopables. At first I thought it was ok, since it added some extra scent. But honestly, you get that from your laundry detergent and/or fabric softener, so realistically there is no reason to add yet another product and more money to the laundry.The biggest problem I have with it is that it seems like it kills the fabric softener. I have noticed my towels are stiffer and rough. It is worse than not using any fabric softener at all. Even when I don't use softener, my towels are never this rough feeling.I don't use alot of crystals at all either. I use enough to cover the bottom of the lid/cap that you use for dispensing. That is really all you need in order to add a decent amount of scent. So, the roughness is not due to using too much of the Unstopables.My other big complaint is that I can tell a huge difference in the dark loads - they attract more lint and hair. All loads have more static cling as well when using the Unstopables, but the dark loads are terrible.This product just isn't worth it for me in the long run. It adds extra unnecessary cost to the laundry. I do at least 2 loads a day, every day. Most days I have more loads. With 3 teens in sports and cheeleading, laundry is a major part of my day. I do not need it to cost more money. I get a nice amount of scent from the fabric softener and detergent, so I will stick with those and occasional stain pre treaters of course."
5.00,"great smell! I would buy this one again! If I can find it in my local store. I'm anxious to try the other scents."
2.00,"I loved the scent of this, it was on sale & I had a coupon. I'd read reviews about the scent being very strong so used in sparingly in the first load. Nothing. Tried it again and filled the entire cap, as I was doing a big load. Some items had a light pleasant fragrance, others none at all. It seemed that only the all cotton items carried the scent. However it would be far to expensive, in my opinion, to justify using it regularly. And after a few hours, the scent is definitely fading. Oh well! It was fun to try it."
5.00,"tried this on a lark; but now subscribe regularly. It works and so easy I can do the laundry though she really wants me to stay in the kitchen."
4.00,"smells good. although it is my second choice. like to use on curtains and blankets. does last for few days"
5.00,"I work out just about everyday, so needless to say, my workout gear and towels can get a little mildewy and it's so hard to get them smelling fresh. That's why I was excited to discover Downy Unstopables In Wash Fresh Scent Booster.                                                                     First off, this product is so easy to use. Just open, pour as much or as little as you'd like into the cap and toss into your washing machine. If you pour in more, you'll get a stronger scent and if you pour in less, the scent won't be as strong. Frankly, I like that you can control the scent because each load of laundry is different. I love adding extra to towels, bed sheets, and active gear, but only a little to every day clothes. Like other reviewers, I was a bit worried, since what you pour into your washing machine are little tablets or capsules and I was worried that they would not all dissolve. But have no fear. Everything dissolved and I was left with fresh-smelling laundry.                                                                     I've used scented laundry detergent and fabric softener in the past, but the smell never lasts. However, with Downy Unstopables, you'll find your laundry smelling fresh for a really long time. I look forward to trying different scents and definitely recommend."
5.00,"I have 8 sets of sheets for my bed, two sets in each of four colors. I switch colors on the first Saturday of March, June, September, and December. I pulled out the the space bag containing my yellow spring sheets last night, in preparation for putting them on the bed next weekend. When I sealed them up last June I put a couple of dryer sheets in with them in hopes of avoiding that musty smell you get in sheets that have been stored for a long time. That didn't work - yuck! I decided to wash them this weekend with half a cup of baking soda in the wash load, and a cup of white vinegar in the rinse load. That always helps, but never takes the smell away completely. The sheets are made from Tencel (third generation Rayon) so fabric softener isn't necessary, and will actually break down the fibers and shorten the life of the sheets. I was at the grocery store this morning and saw the Downy Unstopables, and thought - I'll give them a try. I bought the Fresh scent because they were available in a smaller size. I have a high efficiency portable top loading machine with no agitator. I had seen a few other people mention that the beads didn't dissolve completely, so I put in half a cap-ful, along with half a cup of baking soda, set the machine to the lowest water level, and then let it start its cycle so that the beads got spun around in the water for a few minutes. This really seemed to help with dissolving the beads. I then paused the machine, reset the water level to the right level for the load, added detergent (Mrs Meyers) and the sheets. I wash the sheets in wash bags so they don't get tangled due to the agitator-less design of my machine. I went back and added a cup of white vinegar to the rinse. The result? No musty smell whatsoever. The sheets smell like the scent of the Unstopables, with no musty smell hiding underneath. They are currently hanging on my indoor clotheslines, and making my apartment smell nice. I can't see using them on my clothes, as they are a bit expensive to use all the time, but for sheets that have been languishing in a closet (or a Space Bag) these will now become a part of my regular routine! My only gripe - why did they misspell unstoppable? Where's the extra P Downy?"
5.00,"This stuff smells great and works very well. I can honestly say that we have linen in the closet that was washed several months ago and it still smells amazing great."
4.00,"Love this scent. I don't really smell it in my clothes after they are hanging in the closet for a few days. Maybe I am not using enough in the washer. But still a very nice scent when they come out of the dryer. Love using this with my whites as it helps mask the smell of bleach that lingers in the clothes."
4.00,"After the purchase of a case of fragrance free fabric softener, this product swooped in and saved the day. The smell is delightful, fresh smell that is not overbearing and lasts three weeks (and still going....). The downfall of the product, like any scented product, is skin irritation from overdoing it. The Unstopables does not have a measuring device other than the lid (no measurement lines on lid) and the directions are \"as little or as much as you'd like\". In order to get the best scent you have to play around with how much your skin can tolerate vs scent strength. Not a deal breaker issue though. One bottle lasted over a month with a household of six"
2.00,"First of all, let me say I was so excited to try this! Who doesn't like good smelling laundry? I love the smell of the \"Fresh Scent\" unstopables.I thought the best way to try this out would be using it on blankets, towels and sheets. In the directions it states \"use as little or as much as you want\" so I decided to try it both ways. I started off using a little amount and thought maybe this was why the smell didn't last very long. Then I used a lot, I was so disappointed, the smell only lasted a couple of days also! My Downy fabric softener lasts longer than this!!! I won't be buying this product again, I will be sticking to my Tide laundry detergent and Downy fabric softener."
5.00,"Had to try these after they somehow were suggested on Amazon. They last quite some time. I use a 'couple shakes' per load, but you can use less or more depending on your needs. They are a little pricey but make your clothes smell lovely. I usually use no dyes or scents since I am sensitive and have found no trouble using the unstoppables. I bought the blue one, not sure what scent it is, but will be buying them again as I am out (after a few monthes). Oh, and it makes sweaty boy clothes smell nice too."
5.00,"I received this as a free sample and loved it so much, I immediately ordered more from Amazon.  Both scents are fantastic and stayed with the fabric until washed.  I love this for stinky teenage clothes, and getting rid of that musty smell that the washer can get in the summer when the kids leave their wet clothes too long.  It's also really nice to make towels, bedding, and bed clothes smell fresh, no matter how long they sit in the drawer or closet before using.  It may be too pretty for some men, but neither of the men in this house have complained.  My only complaint is that I later found that it sells for much less at Target and Walmart.  I wish Amazon would offer a better price as I'd love to use this with every laundry load."
5.00,"Everyone should try this because it makes your clothes smell so awesome. I ahve since found it in the stores as well"
5.00,"I think Downy hit a home run with the unstopable line. Washing towels and sheets with these and then pulling them out weeks later, the smell is still there. This is great, because using fabric softener reduces the absorbant efficacy of towel fibers. Unstopables are scent based only, no softening agent. Glow scent is not overpowering. None of the scents are."
5.00,"I love downy unstoppables but is a little expensive, I use a bottle weekly."
5.00,"These are terrific ,just the easiest to use.My clothes hold the scent for a long time. love them. will continue to buy these"
5.00,"This product is GREAT, makes my whole closet smell soooooo good, I never want to be without it. Friends and strangers are commenting on the fabulous smell and I recommend it happily."
5.00,"This thing is awesome but it works ONLY if you use the right amount, and there seems to be a widespread misconception about what the right amount is. I take exactly half of what the measuring cup can hold and it works AMAZING! I even used this once while the washing machine was filling up with the washing machine lid open, and there happened to be a fan blowing air next to the washing machine (this happened last summer) and in the time it took for the washing machine fill up, the fan blew scented air that left my apartment smelling awesome the whole day. Also, here's one trick I learned online. Take 2 table spoons of this thing and put them inside your vacuum cleaner bag at the time you're installing a new one. When you vacuum, your whole home will smell like this. Saved me from buying the expensive feebreeze branded bags they sell for my vacuum cleaner that don't even work this well. And with the clothes you're washing? Its originally intended purpose? Best product of its kind I have ever used. It's really unstoppable!"
5.00,"I makes my laundry smell good. Easy to use. Good for the wash and do not need dryer sheets with scents."
2.00,"Other than \"unstopables\" not being an actual word, this product has another problem:  who on earth is going to pay a premium - a large premium - for extra perfume for their clothes?  I won't be.                                                                     Basically, this product is a bunch of waxy-feeling granules that you add to your washing machine.  Water breaks it down, releasing its perfume, and there you have it - scented clothes.  It does the job, and the perfume is pleasant-enough smelling.                                                                     But then again, both my detergent and fabric softener also smell fine.  If I use these in combination, I end up with three different perfumes vying for supremacy, leading to a weird concoction of aromas that...shouldn't be.  Remove one (or two) of those perfumes, and the clothes are back to smelling how you figured they were.                                                                     Perhaps if you use unscented detergent and fabric softener (does that even exist?), and use this just because you fell in love with the scent, it would make sense.  In the real world, however, this product doesn't make any sense at all.  And while I received my container of it free of charge, I hope that the list price is actually a 3 or 4 pack, because not only is this nothing special (and an awkward product), but it's also quite expensive.  I won't be buying it or using it again, once this container is used up."
3.00,"i put this in two vacuums we use at home as read about on a blog to eliminate the musty/vacuum aromas. works great for emitting a nice fresh aroma; unfortunately I sneezed a lot. will be looking for someone who can use this product either as intended (if it made be sneeze i will not use it in the laundry)or in vacuum cleaner!"
5.00,"Love this product - it's the only softener that I will buy.  Liquid softeners are bad for my septic system and dryer sheets clog dryer vents.  I've noticed that the smell is very subtle (sometimes hard to detect) until you rub the fabric.  That's when the scent comes out very nicely.  My favorite is the fresh scent (blue) product."
4.00,"This is the best solution if you have stinky water. We use a filter and softener, but our well water is gross. When I have to hang dry clothes, they get this horrible egg water odor. Using this is the only solution that works. It's a miracle. And it's so much cheaper to buy them on Amazon rather than the store."
5.00,"Honestly, I thought these were a big waste of money when my husband brought them home...I mean, we already use Downey...so, I thought we did not need. Ha, ha, ha...now I'm the one adding them to the cart. They smell great and leave a nice scent a bit longer than softener."
1.00,"This toxic product scored an F on EWG.ORG stating HIGHEST CONCERN. Potentially significant hazards to health or the environment. Please do your research before exposing yourself and your family to this product."
5.00,"You should not have to filled this stupid box out. Thanks in advance for removing this stupid and senseless requirements!"
5.00,"I have a very musty house with pretty bad airflow. this helps to keep my clothes fresher smelling for a longer amount of time."
5.00,"love, love, love this stuff. it makes laundry smell really fresh. i love curling up in my comforter or using towels right out of the shower after doing laundry. one capful into the washing machine works for a full load. you can put the beads in at the beginning of the load (no more waiting for the washer to tell you its time for softener, or goocking up your washing machine in teh softener slot), and when water goes into the machine, the beads dissolve easily - I have never had any residue from these beads. I still use the dryer sheets occasionally but you dont need to with these. the scent is great - not overpowering, it is the light and fresh."
3.00,"I saw this and decided to try it out since my clothes never seem to have that fresh scent from ether the laundry detergent OR fabric softeners. I was a bit skeptical at first, but I do have to admit, this works. I actually had a couple co-workers comment on the \"fabric softener\" I was using.                                                                     That being said, WHY can't there be a laundry detergent or softener that delivers this? Why should we have to pay for yet another item to deliver that fresh laundered scent? And why must it be so darned expensive? I find to get my clothes to the scent I want, I have to use about half a capful of the Unstoppables, and if I want all my clothes to have this fresh scent, this doesn't last very long.                                                                     Bottom line; yes it works and well, and if you have the money to spend on it it's perfect but I can't justify the price for the performance. If I use this I will use it for certain items of clothing. In the mean time, the search continues for a laundry detergent or softener that delivers what it promises instead of having to shell out the $ for a separate product."
3.00,"this is ok but pretty pricey I love the smell but it is hard at times to use sometimes if you are in a hurry and you use to much and wow does the smell lingers it is not bad but to much is to much would buy it but just to expensive"
5.00,"Wow super fresh smell. I love this item!"
5.00,"Makes my laundry smell great! Even after two weeks in the drawer, they come out as fresh as when they went in."
5.00,"I take care of my mom who had a stroke and is incotinent, with these I don't have that bleach and pee smell that I was getting. Now I can use a little bit of bleach to disinfect and the clothes come out smelling wonderful."
5.00,"This washing scent booster is great. I find it leaves all my clothes smelling so much better. I use it for every load. Other companies have such a product, but are much more expensive. The scent is there and it's great. Highly recommend this over the other brands which are so much more expensive."
2.00,"I've been using this for weeks now, switching from the purple to the blue. It smells wonderful in the wash, but I don't find the scent to be lasting much after the dryer except on towels. I would expect my entire closet should be wafting with the wonderful scent by now, having washed nearly all my clothing in it, but alas. . . no. I had hoped my bed linens would retain the scent after making the bed, but by the time I climb into bed. . . not so much and certainly nothing after a day or so. Over priced and over-rated in my opinion and just a gimmicky thing. Perhaps if my washer and dryer were on the main floor, I would have the added benefit of fragrancing my home as I did the wash, but unfortunately, they're in the basement. Very disappointed. Will have to try the Gain product."
5.00,"I love to add these to my laundry to add a subtle scent to my clothes and towels. If I add more than just the bottom of the cap, it's too strong and makes me sneeze."
3.00,"works fine used for bedding, smells great but for clothing,scent did not linger at all,ill stick to my downey liguid.thanks I lov walmart!!!!!!!!!!!"
4.00,"I bought these solely to enhance the smell of my awful dog beds when I was them- I feel no amount of a fabric softener (liquid or sheets) compares to these bad boys. Also does wonders to my normal laundry."
5.00,"I absolutely love these Downy Unstopables. It keeps my clothes so fresh smelling for weeks. I will always use and enjoy this product."
5.00,"I have hard water that sometimes smells like blood. Iron. Gotta love it. This stuff makes everything smell nice and clean and lasts, too! When my friends run out, they come to me begging for a cap full. Its just that good!"
5.00,"IT WORKS GREAT.I STARTED WITH A VERY SMALL AMOUNT,I HAVE VERY SENSITIVE SKIN.NO ITCH,NO RASH,CLOTHES SMELL GREAT,EVEN FROM THE FRONT LOADER...LOVE THIS STUFF !! I WILL GET MORE"
3.00,"I like the smell, very light floral scent. After a load is washed it leaves a nice light scent on the clothes, but doesn't seem to last very long. But the price for this seems a little high."
5.00,"I have tried every different brand of these scent shaky thingies and this is definitely The Best. Last the longest and smells delic!"
5.00,"I fell in love with this product. Our clothes smell so amazing all day long and the Fresh scent is so crisp."
5.00,"What can I say, I absolutely LOVE this product. Recieved a sample in the mail and it sat there for about four months. My friend told me how much she loved using the product(although quite pricey). I used my sample on the next load and my laundry room even smelled wonderful. With three boys and a husband in construction, the laundry can get pretty stinky. Using this, it literally takes all that stink and funky smell away from the clothes! Even a few guys at work said that my husbands' shirt smelled good, much to his embarassment. =) Only down side is the price. =("
5.00,"This is a Great Product, no need for softening sheets in the Dryer and the convenience of putting it in before the wash is awesome......But the Fresh Sent just last forever, I'm Really Impressed! :)"
5.00,"I am obsessed with this stuff!! It seriously makes the clothes smell SO amazing!! And for a LONG time!! I refuse to wash my clothes without it. And as much as I LOVE Gain the Downy Unstoppables work MUCH better!! And I even tested out the crystals and they PALE in comparison!!"
5.00,"the unstopables work great and have a real good smell. the scent does hold up. i put some in a spray bottle and spray it on my bedding an also in my car smells great. thanks jw"
3.00,"Downy Unstopables are ok, they do leave a nice scent in your laundry without the use of softener. For me it was just another item I have to remember to add to the wash and I keep forgetting it, plus it just does not leave enough of a scent that lasts."
4.00,"I haven't used this product with my normal laundry load, but I have used it with bathroom rugs and towels. In each load I used a full cap, and each load smelled noticeably better. However, the scent was gone within 3-4 days of sitting in the guest linens closet."
5.00,"I've been using this product for at least a year now, and I love it. I don't have to use much at all, and I still end up with wonderful smelling clothes. I used a quarter cap full in the load with my uniforms and the scent is still going strong. I can smell it when I open drawers to grab a shirt, and I can still smell it on the shirt at the end of the day. I normally get this at the commissary back home, but being on deployment, this is one of the only ways to get Unstopables. I know there were some reviews about it being cheaper at Walmart, but for some of us there is no Walmart or Publix for thousands of miles. My one and only complaint is about how long it took for Amazon to fulfill the order. I ordered it on 19Dec, and they shipped it at the beginning of January. Also, there have been reviews that you have to use non scented detergent or fabric softener for the scent of the Unstopables to shine through. I never had an issue when I used scented detergent, and I still have no issue now that I'm using home made detergent. And I use vinegar as a fabric softener now, and it doesn't affect this stuff at all."
4.00,"Unstoppable are a splurge I allow myself. The extra smell for clothing is more of a want than I need. Fresh is my favorite scent. Shimmer and Glow follow in second place."
3.00,"I started using this product when I was given a coupon for it at a convention that I attended a few years ago. I LOVED the idea of it and, of course, in the samples that they showed me at the convention of \"30 day old\" scraps of cloth that had been washed with the Downy Unstopables they smelled like heaven! I really liked the idea of my laundry smelling like it had just come out of the dryer for weeks after it was washed (particularly my bedding and towels). However, while my laundry DOES come out smelling fantastic right after it is washed it does NOT (in my opinion) retain very much smell for even a few days after - let alone weeks. I have continued to use this product hoping that I would get a better result from my new HE washer, or a different scent but so far I have been underwhelmed. In fact, I recently switched from store-brand to name-brand dryer sheets and have been more impressed with the scent of those than the Unstopables. I am going to try some of the other options that are now on the market by other companies to see how they perform. I will also mention that I have had a few issues with the beads not dissolving in the wash and ending up in my dryer (which is a nightmare to clean up when they melt in there). It only seems to happen when I wash bedding (like it gets caught up inside of the sheets/blankets/whatever). Most of the time it is fine, but it has happened. Overall, I am considering giving up on the Unstopables. I love the IDEA of them, but in reality? Not so much."
5.00,"Addicting! I ran out of this recently and found myself not wanting to do any more loads until I ordered a replacement."
5.00,"Works great for all the wash that you need and makes them it smell a lot better than without it."
2.00,"I added 1 capfull in my first load and 2 capfuls in my second load and I really can't say it does any better than my laundry soap and dryer sheets. How many capfuls or how much do I have to use to make it work???"
5.00,"I absolutely love the smell of Downey unstopables, this is a New scent and its just as great smelling as the others your clothes will feel soft and smell fresh for weeks."
5.00,"This is simply the best! just add a little or add a whole cap full for clothes that smell nice for extended time after washing. Very good value for price."
5.00,"I can't say enough about how much I love this product! I will never let myself run out of it!"
5.00,"I use an unscented laundry detergent for most my clothes since I don't like the extra scents when I'm wearing my freshly washed clothes.  The downside of using unscented detergent is that after a few years of use, my towels and bedding (which I don't mind having a scent) have retained an old musty smell that I can't get rid of no matter how many times I wash.  I've tried strongly scented dryer sheets and fabric softeners for my towels and bedding, but nothing really worked.  THIS did the trick.  I just poured in a quick shake with my bedding and towels load and when they came out they smelled great!                                                                     A little goes a long way too - since the scent beads were colored, I was worried I'd get spots on my light colored load so I only put in about a teaspoon full, but the smell was still great.  This has become a staple in my laundry arsenal."
5.00,"Downy Unstopables is a fabulous product. In fact, one of the best smelling fragrances dealing with laundry in a long time.                                                                     One tip is that if you hang your items to dry (or only partially dry them), they will smell fresh for a really long time. If you dry them all the way, the smell doesn't last as long.                                                                     I use these with our sheets, towels, and my kids tennis shoes which I wash weekly. Since they are air dried, they smell great!"
4.00,"I purchased this with skepticism. The purple smelled way better (less cheapy) than the blue bottle.                                                                     I use this for my towels since I don't use fabric softener on them and also use for sheets.  The smell lasts a few days and is pleasant.  Towels can get a musty smell over time and mine smell oh-so-fresh! The down side is to get a decent amount of smell, you need to use about a half a cap full.  The bottle has about 12 full cap fulls in it, making it kinda expensive for fresh smelling towels.  If you use this for every load, it won't last long."
3.00,"This will definitely leave a scent in your laundry and even in your whole house if you put enough in. I think one teaspoon is plenty for my taste. I like the scent fine, but don't love it. I really don't love the house smelling like it when I put in 1/2 of the cup provided. I can't imagine what a whole cup would do. It did, on one load, mask the slight sour scent from leaving it in too long. And it is fun to have that perfume to my clothes when they're done. It's definitely stronger than my regular fabric softener (bounce sheets), especially at 1/4 to 1/2 cupfull.If you like the scent of laundry detergents, then this would be perfect for you. Me? I don't know. I'll keep it around for loads that are starting to sour. I kind of like putting in a teaspoon for most loads, but I question the real need for it on a regular basis."
5.00,"This is the best smelling stuff!! OMG! Every time I was clothes, I use this and my whole house smells like Downey. I got my daughter addicted to it and have a bottle to mail to my sister! If you haven't tried the unstoppables, TRY it and you'll LOVE it!"
3.00,"If you like the scent of Febreze, you'll love the &quot;Fresh&quot; scent. If, however, the smell of Febreze makes you retch (as it does me), think twice before purchasing &quot;Fresh&quot;. Haven't tried &quot;Lush&quot; or &quot;Shimmer&quot; yet. Once my stomach settles and my nose clears up, maybe..."
5.00,"I use this on my sheets every time I wash them and I love the smell. So clean smelling and it really does last a few days."
4.00,"Smells good in the bottle, but will have try with unscented detergent to see how good it really is, I'll keep this scent for my fiance's clothes and by myself the spring scent because it smells more like april fresh."
4.00,"Really the headline says it all. I was just surprised that ordering it in bulk didn't save more cost. Smells nice though."
5.00,"The Downy Unstopables in Wash Fresh Scent Booster is everything it advertises and more.  With using only one cap full, my entire load of laundry smelled divine; even after coming out of the dryer.                                                                     This product is easy to use -- just put one cap full in your wash water as the tub is filling up and as this product states, your laundry comes out smelling clean, fresh and totally awesome!                                                                     I definitely recommend this product and have since bought my own.  I loved it.                                                                     Natalie S. for Amazon Vine"
3.00,"It smells fabulous. But I just didn't real feel like it was worth the additional expense. One bottle only lasted my family for about 3-4 weeks."
5.00,"This product works wonders. I live in an apartment, which does not have laundry in each unit. We all share a laundry room for every two building s(i.e.24 units total). Most of the time, our laundry smells...well a little stinky even after washing it. We have tried everything from febreeze to exrta soap to anything that you can think of. This item works wonders. THANK YOU DOWNY!!"
5.00,"Long lasting freshness in every load! Only use if you like your clothes to have a strong scent. We love this product,"
5.00,"I love this product and wished I had it for all those days when I did laundry at the laundry mat. I hated carrying that heavy jug of detergent, and so I would always use the sheets even though they were never as good as the liquid fabric softener. These beads freshen my clothes so much better than the sheets. Additionally, I've put a tablespoon in a tulle bag and keep them in the drawers to keep my clothes fresh while in the closet."
5.00,"I am a machinist. As a machinist I use coolant (soluble oil) and cutting oil to do my work on lathes and mills. I often work on conventional machines ,where it is difficult to avoid getting coolant or oil on my shirt and pants. So I do my own laundry and I tried several other products to remove the lingering smell from my clothes. But nothing seems to work well and even though my clothes are clean they still wreek from the oil odor. I found Downy unstopable at my local HD. I use this on my weekly work clothes laundry everytime now. It really works it removes the strong odor and even softens my clothes. I highly recommend Downy Unstopables to anyone that is a machinist , mechanic,or person that works around oil."
2.00,"I just don't see the point in buying something like this. I used it, but since I already use fabric softener, boosting the scent is simply overkill and a waste of money."
4.00,"Nice product, easy to use and smells nice. Would definitely purchase again, makes clothing smells nice. I recommend this product!"
5.00,"Downy Unstopables should be in every house. This stuff makes your clothes smell fantastic. I use these on top of my normal mixture that goes in my washer.                                                                     1 Scoop of Detergent                                              1 Scoop of Baking Soda                                              Gain Fabric Softener                                              Cap of Downy Unstopables"
5.00,"I got these at RiteAid originally and after my first use, I absolutely fell in love! My husband even noticed that the clothes smelled \"fresher\". I love the scent, it's simple but nice and powerful. We only use about 1/4-1/2 lid full per load. For the two of us, we go through one of these in about a month. I add half of what we measure out before anything else, and then the other half on top of the load right before I close the lid. I have started to pair this with the \"Downy Infusions Liquid Fabric Softener\" in the scent \"Honey Flower\". And I think the two pair lovely together. I could never go back to just detergent. Bottom line: This stuff is amazing, makes our clothes smell great, and is worth every penny."
5.00,"I love this scent! There are some issues with allergies to dyes and strong perfumes in my house so I stay away from those mechanically infused \"waterfall/spring garden/ Hawaiin mist/fill in the blank\" scents. However, this booster was soft and gave a lovely smell, yet withstood the heat of the dryer to leave a lovely soft scent. I will say that by day 3 the scent was gone but it is a nice booster to add to your delicats. To be honest I would't spend the money to add it to every piece of clothing as I view this in the category of Woolite(something you would use on your favorite clothing or delicates)."
5.00,"I absolutely love this product!  I always buy it every week, I love how my clothes smell when I use it!!                                                                     The smell actually lasts a long time, and you don't need to use a lot of it in every load, but I make sure I never run out, and always get extras when it is on sale.                                                                     I recommend it to all my friends."
5.00,"Pricey, but it does keep your laundry smelling fresher longer especially if you hang out your clothes. I've only tried this scent and it smells fresh and clean."
4.00,"These do add a great smell to the clothes after laundry. I'm not sure they are worth the cost though, so I dropped a star."
5.00,"The lingering fresh smell is awesome. After a week of folded towels - the freshness lingers. I love it and my family enjoys the freshness"
5.00,"I truly love this product. It's a bit pricey compared to the regular liquid fabric softener but definitely worth it. I especially enjoy using this product for bedding, jeans, and bath towels."
5.00,"I love this stuff It makes your clothes smell so good and it is very easy to use. I will buy forever"
5.00,"It works very nicely, and smells great. We use this for all our bedding and the smell lasts and lasts."
4.00,"Good product, easy to use, but my clothes stay fresh for only about a week or so. I still continue to use it though as it leaves the whole laundry room with a fresh scent and I think I'm addicted to the smell!"
1.00,"I had wanted to try this to see if it would help my sheets stay nicely scented longer. I used a small amount in my first load-nothing. Used half a cap in the second-still nothing. I did not want to spend $10 or whatever for the large bottle and had gotten a coupon and used it to purchase what they called a trial size bottle. Still paid over $5 for it even with the coupon. I am so glad I did not spend more. Total waste of money. No scent right from the dryer let alone after sitting for weeks in storage. How on earth do they get away with advertising that it ha this wonderful long lasting scent? lesson learned"
5.00,"This stuff makes your laundry smell wonderful! I f I don't have it, I wont do laundry!!"
5.00,"This one is the best scent of them all but you are unable to find them many places so I get mine from here"
3.00,"Downy laundry scent booster does in fact leave your laundry smelling great- but it's definitely a light scent. The Gain brand are much stronger and leave the laundry smelling fresh much longer."
3.00,"Downy Unstopables In Wash Fresh Scent Booster - I like these scent boosters. They are not fabric softeners, they just add a scent to your clothes. You shake out a little or a lot into the cap and then add to the clothes while washing.                                              The scent is stronger when you add to the wash than when you take them out of the dryer. I think it fades some once the clothes have dried.                                              I think they're expensive for what they're supposed to do, although I do like this product."
5.00,"The Downy Unstopables in Fresh smells amazing. When I am doing laundry I can smell it throughout my place. The scent reminds me of Irish Spring mixed with Tide Mountain Spring Scent. The product on its own is amazing; however the drawback is the lack of scent choices and correlations with other scented products. I assume that Procter and Gamble wanted to test the waters first before they created too many scents but depending on what detergent and softener you use both scents could clash with them. My favorite detergent is Tide Total Care, but Gain Apple Mango Tango is my favorite laundry scent. I used it with the Gain and I felt that the scents almost cancelled each other out with the Downy scent being a little more dominant. I also use this to make scent pouches, I just put a few pellets in a small mesh, muslin, or gauze cloth, tie it with a ribbon and now my drawers smell amazing. One problem I have is that the directions states to use a little or a lot, there are lines in the cap to measure but it would have been nice to have some general guidelines on how much to use. I suspect that this could have been on purpose to encourage people to purchase a new bottle sooner than necessary, creating more revenue, which is fine by me, but just a thought to put out there. The last thing I am surprised at is the price here on Amazon; I was able to purchase one bottle on sale for $5.99 at Target with a regular price of $6.99. I find that overall this product serves its purpose but is not necessary as it only adds scent and could be considered a luxury laundry product. One last thing to mention, `unstopables' is misspelled, which makes looking for it online a little confusing. I hope that it was on purpose so they could trademark the name and was not an oversight on the company's part."
5.00,"I love the unstopables as they really do have a nice, long lasting addition to the laundry without having to use liquid softener. Also, just like the package says you can add a little or a lot depending upon how strong you want once they come out of the dryer. They also retain the scent while using a different brand of dryer sheet for static cling. There are a few different scents and i have tried just about all of them, so while this is not necessarily the strongest one, it is my favorite! (hint, if you want stronger the one with the dark pink lid is very strong and you really don't need that much.) Great product!"
5.00,"Unstopables are a must have in every load of laundry i do now. its amazing how fresh my sheets smell after sitting on a shelf for a few weeks, simply amazing and refreshing."
2.00,"I really like the smell of the Downy Unstopables. But what really are they for? I use Tide or Gain and my laundry always smells nice. I just don't know why you would need to add one more thing on top of detergent and softener."
5.00,"My sister in law bought these and left them at our house...I was skeptical at first I thought they were dumb and a waste of money. It took me about a year to use the first bottle of them...and to my surprise I missed them! So now I buy them as well. For the towel loads and the loads of just my clothes (not my husband's) I add them. I think it does give and extra smell boost of freshness. I kinda of consider them 'special occasion'. So if I am in the mood I use them and if not I don't. They are so strong (and good) after washing but after drying the good smell fades a bit. Still I think they are a fun thing to add for the housewives out there to treat themselves a bit lol. Ha"
5.00,"Love this in the Fresh Scent (it seems to last the longest from the other Downy scents for some reason). It leaves everything smelling fresh for days. I especially love using Unstopables with my sheets and towels. I'm hooked!"
3.00,"Ok, so, I'm not all that familiar with the scent booster products, but the commercials make them look awesome. Amazon had a fantastic price on this, so I gave it a whirl. It had the best reviews as far as scent goes. The pros? It works. You really smell that smell. The cons, the smell, while vaguely reminiscent of \"freshness\" is a little MORE reminiscent of \"crazy glue.\" My husband now goes on and on about the crazy glue smell in the bed, which, if the ads on TV are correct, should last about 5 more weeks. Awesome. I'll try this again, but maybe in a different scent. Perhaps, they have a gorilla glue scent? Update: March 9, 2014. The smell is now *almost* gone, and has entered what could, perhaps, be seen as pleasant now. Took quite a while though, no joke. GO LIGHTLY with the application on this stuff."
4.00,"I've tried the blue and pink of this product - pink is my new fav! It gives clothing/towels that extra boost of scent to give you that freshly-washed smell just a little longer than detergent alone. Throughout the use of my first bottle (blue) I did find that not-completely dissolved pellet stuck to a shirt of jeans every so often... but they have become a part of my regular laundry routine."
5.00,"I use this on all of our bedding because of the lovely smell. I also use it for my fine clothing. Too expensive to use on more but would sure like to."
5.00,"I can't stop raving about these unstopables. I sprinkled them under my sheets so I could smell the fresh scent, even- I put them in the bottom of our garbage can too- they are awesome~"
5.00,"My wife love this product and then fragance for the laundry, very goood th edelivery on time and conditions, very good"
4.00,"I totally love this scent booster. The only one thing I've noticed that only blue ones are very strong, other ones are not as powerful. The cheapest price on these downys are at Costco, moreover, they sell them in HUUUUUGE packs, which is very good too. Very glad I found these ones, bc I really like when my laundry smells fresh and clean. I use this product with all the ORIGINAL GAIN products (liquid detergent, softener). They give a wonderful smell all together."
5.00,"I really enjoy this product. The amount one would use is adjustable. No after product to throw away. I love the scents that are available. Larger quantities (19.5 oz) to choose from. The quality of this product is amazing! I'm really hooked on this product!"
5.00,"excellent product"
4.00,"First, these are way too expensive here. Get them for $2 or more dollars less locally.                                              That said, I love these.  Took a few loads of laundry to figure out the way to get the most and longest lasting scent.                                              For a large load of sheets or whatever, use a whole cap.  I know, it's a lot.  Just trust me for a minute.  The most important thing:  dry your items on LOW until they are JUST dry.  I have an anti-bac setting on my dryer, and even setting the temp on low, the scent was mostly baked out of my sheets.  Better yet, hang or liine dry whatever you can.  Not always an option, I know.                                              I only use this for sheets, towels, throw rugs etc.  And following the above instructions, I've gotten the most out of this product and love it.                                              And this scent?  Lush is right.  LOVE it for sheets and towels, I use the blue for throw rugs.  Nice and fresh.  Hope this helps someone!                                              Subtracted one star as this bottle does not last long at all."
5.00,"My mother does demos on the weekend and she had demoed these so she brought a couple of samples home for me to try. My sister came by one day for my help on something and asked if she could bring her laundry so I said yes. I still had the packets sitting on the dryer and she said she loved these things. I hadn't tried them so we used a whole packet in the wash and OMG! the smell permeated through the whole house! I wash all of my clothes with a cap full of crystals now. My jeans smell great for days! Every time I have freshly washed jeans, coworkers at work comment on how good I smell. :) I need to compare the prices here at Amazon vs the grocery store. The blue cap is my favorite. I bought some of the purple but not a fan; I haven't tried the pink yet because I'm in love with the blue cap smell. Along with my Purex Linens and Lillies laundry liquid and the Downy Unstopables, they remind me of a laundry detergent I had bought in England many years ago that had a nice strong fresh scent that lasted for days on in called Radion. Triple LOVE this stuff!"
5.00,"My towels, sheets and clothes smell fantastic and fresh for weeks after using washing. I have been using Downy Unstopables for over 7 months. I bought a new washer and dryer for a new home and thought I would give my beautiful new machines an extra perk. WOW! WOW! I have been hooked ever since. Admittedly, I do not use much at all. Because I have a new high efficient machine, I do not need much of any product. One bottle of Unstopables lasted about four months and I do about 6-8 large loads of laundry a week. I still use fabric softener and Tide with a touch of Downy and fabric softener sheets in the dryer. I do not add liquid fabric softener to my laundry when washing towels. So, I have read a few other reviewers mention the additional high cost. It can be fairly negligible if you purchase this on sale or bulk and use wisely. The reward to your nose is worth it. My scent of choice is lush (purple). It is a bit more subtle than the most popular blue labeled scent. I enjoy lavendar in many things around the house and use lavendar pillow sprays when I change the sheets to promote restful sleep. Your linen closets will smell wonderful, as will your drawers and traditional closets. This will give your workout clothes an extra perspiration anti-stink fighting boost because they already smell delicious. You will want to bury your face in your towels, pillows and even your kitchen towels, which I think can pick up odors quickly. The only thing you may want to consider is guests or family members who are sensitive to fragrance and/or perfumes. I teach Yoga and other execise classes at my home. I love washing towels for my Yogi with Unstopables, but I always have a few towels available that have not been washed with extra perfumes. Enjoy!!"
5.00,"I bought this to try because my son told me it smells good, I used it and it makes your clothes smell so good when you take them out.  I have already recommended the product to others and I plan on buying more when I need it."
5.00,"I am one of those guys out there that does the laundry. Especially since I have one of the new front loading Samsung He washers that can handle all of the clothes that I throw at it. Before doing a load, I add a half cap full of these scent booster beads to the wash, add the clothes and start the process. After switching to the dryer and they finish drying, it's so nice to have such a clean fresh smell to the wash that it actually makes folding less of a chore. Highly recommend this product!!"
4.00,"You don't need much and when you do pour it toward back of washer if using front loading machines."
3.00,"We like the Downy Unstopables, but really did not care for this scent. It did not hold it's scent very long after the wash was over."
5.00,"I like to use this in my drapes and scatter rugs, but most of all the dogs bed, the smell lingers in the air for a long time especially if you do not dry the item. I always hang my drapes damp."
5.00,"I always use this product when doing my laundry. I absolutely love the scent and love how it lingers on my clothes for weeks after the laundry is done. The fragrance spreads through the whole house when the laundry is going. Sometimes when my room isn't smelling as nice as I like, I will even pour a little in a small bowl and the product will freshen my room. I would recommend this product, as it will keep your laundry smelling nice for weeks!"
5.00,"What a brilliant idea from Downy to create a fragrance for laundry that doesn't involve fabric softener. I don't use fabric softener for my bath towels because it ruins the absorbency, but Unstopables adds a glorious scent that lingers for days and days afterwards. It's so wonderful I also use it (in addition to fabric softener) for bedsheets because the fragrance is so lovely when we go to sleep at night. Give it a try!"
5.00,"Best smell out of all of them . The fragrance last for days I like that you add it to washer at the start so I never forget to add on rinse cycle again :)"
3.00,"Yes, I only gave this product 3 stars but that is strictly based on the scent factor. The product does work and even going to my closet and pulling something out that was washed weeks ago you can still smell the Fresh Scent Booster. The problem is, it's way to flowery and my husband hates it (I'm not really thrilled with the scent either). He says he feels ridiculous walking around at work smelling like he's wearing perfume. Wish they would come up with a less feminine scent, like cotton linen or even something citrusy because while I don't \"hate\" the scent, since my husband does and I wash our cloths together, I can't use it without making him crazy. Even using it on the towels and sheets makes him unhappy because it really is a very strong feminine scent."
5.00,"Love these scent boosters! I tried them when they first came out and have been using them ever since. The Fresh Scent is my favorite, but they are all nice. The smell that it leaves with your laundry does stay for quite a while. My daughter has somewhat sensitive skin and this hasn't bothered her in the slightest."
5.00,"I use this for performance clothing since you can't use fabric softner or it ruins the quick dry and wicking effect. It works great and a few go a long way."
5.00,"I love how this makes my laundry smell. Not too strong or overpowering, and I recommend any but the lavender scents to help freshen up your boys clothes!"
5.00,"I have alot of different fabric softners, but I never seen anything like this product. It made my clothes very soft and the smell lasted even after wearing the clothes. I will continue to buy this product and I will recommend trying it."
5.00,"I do a lot of running / gym workouts, and this really makes all of those clothes smell great.  With regular clothes, you get the great smell along with the option of no fabric softner.  There is just no instructions on how much to use with your wash...."
5.00,"I like the smell, it follows it out of the dryer even! You get six small bottles of this stuff but it ends up equalling around the same amount of the large one you find at costco or walmart but are easier to move around since it is one small bottle. Nothing much to say but I love the smell :)"
5.00,"I've used this for about a year now and I like the scents and they last long. There's clothes that I don't use for weeks and when I put them on they still smell good. I highly recommend it."
3.00,"\"Unstopables\" indeed can add a wonderful scent to one's laundry. My reservation is that, since it has no other function, it is costly to use yet another product, where using Downy fabric softener would both add scent and remove wrinkles from materials.                                                                     I tried Unstopables on several loads of laundry. I found that, though any amount can add some attractive scent, for it to be noticeable or enduring requires using a full capful. (Doing so gave my bedding and curtains a wonderful effect.) I also noticed that, for whites, neither the scent of bleach nor of the scent booster is especially noticeable - apparently the combination reduces the Downy scent.                                                                     It is a pleasant, attractive addition to the linen room, but a bit pricey. I would prefer to wait for coupons and sales, and get \"Tide with a touch of Downy,\" or Downy fabric softener - scent plus cleansing or softening."
3.00,"The scent of these beads is heavenly. However, I notice that the scent does not last long - only 1-2 days after I pull the clothes out of the dryer. So, I only notice the smell when I am filling the washer or pulling the clothes out of the dryer. By the time I wear them, I can't tell that I ever used them. Therefore, I think they are somewhat of a waste of money. After using them in every load for around six months, I noticed my skin was itchy. Once I stopped using these, the irritation went away. I do have pretty sensitive skin with eczema, so perhaps this is to be expected. But, the liquid softener made by Downy in the same scent does not cause skin irritation. I say save your money and get the same scent in a liquid softener or dryer sheets - both come in the same scent line, are cheaper per load, and the smell lasts longer."
1.00,"Not a Bargain! It is cheaper to buy 4 individual containers. Just order the 4 individuals and save about ten dollars."
1.00,"I purchased the Lush scent of this product. I use Tide Coldwater He liquid detergent and                                              Downy fabric softener.  I added a capful of Unstopables as directed and after machine                                              drying, there was absolutely no scent of Lush.  The only way that the scent would come                                              through would be if you used unscented detergent and unscented or no fabric softener.                                              Otherwise, these Unstopables are a waste of money.                                                                     I've often wondered, if Tide is the highest rated, most advertised, and most expensive                                              detergent, why does Tide market so many additional additives which add considerably to                                              the cost of each washload?  If Tide detergent is as good as they say it is then we                                              shouldn't need anything else except fabric softener which I use sparingly mainly to eliminate                                              static cling.  Hint:  Never use fabric softener on towels as it reduces their absorbency.                                              Fabric softener is oil-based and puts a coating on fabrics.  This is helpful on clothing                                              because it helps with stain removal and eliminates static.  However, on any type                                              of towel - bath towels, hand towels, kitchen towels, it greatly reduces their absorbency                                              and drying time.  And of course, NEVER use fabric softener on microfiber cloths - it ruins them."
5.00,"Downy Unstopables does leave your laundry with a fresh scent.  Just do not use as much as the directions tell you to, they will not dissolve completely in a HE washer."
5.00,"This is my favorite smell of the 3 different scents that Downy Unstopables has, it is a light scent but you CAN smell it. I don't have a HE washing machine just a regular top loader and for a medium load of laundry I use to the second line of the cap and everything comes out smelling awesome. If you're wanting a STRONG smell I would go for the fresh scent (blue). There is nothing I can say bad about any of the scents but everyone has their favorite and this is mine."
2.00,"I tried the one with a purple lid. Initially I was super excited because as weird as it is, I love doing laundry. I like the way the purple one smells - sort of heady and musky with a splash of floral. Green is definately \"clean\".                                                                     The perk is that it made my entire apartment smell like the beads. The downfall is that it really didn't stay on anything I washed. I followed the directions exactly and it didn't matter what kind of water I used or how much...the scent just isn't strong. I also tried without a fabric softener and dryer sheets and it's still very weak. Once the items were folded and put away,it was gone.                                                                     I haven't bought anymore - it's expensive for a smell that doesn't stay. I would rather use dryer sheets.                                                                     I have a very sensitive sense of smell so I can be certain it's very weak."
1.00,"I added this to a batch of homemade laundry detergent -- somewhat reluctantly as I usually don't go for strong chemical scents. Over a few washes I liked the results -- you can clearly tell by smell what loads of laundry are washed and which are not.                                                                     Then I developed a rash -- atopic dermatitis -- traceable to the Unstopables -- the only significant change in my routine. Now I nickname them Downy Untouchables. Googling I quickly found many other reports of this kind of problem.                                                                     I'll retired the beads to towels and sheets only and hope that works -- no more for my clothes."
5.00,"All Downy Unstoppables are amazing! I absolutely LOVE the fragrances. Because they are a little pricey, I only use them every so often. But when I do, WOW! You can smell them from outside while the clothes are drying! BTW, I use approximately 2 capfuls of the balls. Some people say they don't smell a difference, so my suggestion is to add more."
5.00,"I was skeptical at first, like, how can little beads make your clothes smell good?! But, I decided to give these a try anyway. I just go by the lid lines (where it tells small, medium, or large loads). I love these because you can use them with, or without, fabric softener. Although these smell great and make my clothes smell as equally great, I'm not so sure the scent lasts 12 weeks. The scent lasts a decent amount of time, just not 12 weeks. All in all, I will continue to use these beads. Their great on everything, and they keep my towels smelling fresh."
5.00,"This is the best smelling of the three Downy Scents. I am addicted to these things, they make laundry smell soooooo good."
5.00,"This is the best stuff!  I love that it smells like the ORIGINAL Downy fabric softener.  It really does keep clothes smelling good until the next wash, bedding too!  Can't ask for more.  I will definitely buy this again, even with the slightly high price."
4.00,"This was a gift for my daughter. She loves this product since they have hard water, it makes her laundry smell and feel good."
5.00,"These are the best smelling laundry fresheners of all we have tried. I play hockey and my gear gets nasty. My fellow team-mates pay services to clean their gear. This is a much cheaper solution which works just as well if not better. I highly recommend this. Trust me, I have tried everything else. I tried other brands granules product and the resulting smell is awful. The blue UnStopables were the best of all."
4.00,"Love using these but will be in store instead of here next time due to pricing and having to put it as an 'add on' or subscribed item. Just not feasible to buy online"
5.00,"scent and last a very long time! No residue on clothes like liquid fabric softener,,, a little will do to add lasting fragrance"
5.00,"This smells amazing! SO glad we started using this scent booster :) My clothes never seemed to smell as good as they should and now they do!"
5.00,"I was first introduced to Downy Unstopables from a free sample pack I received from an online promotion. I was amazed at not only how great this product smells but also how long it lasted! I made the horrible mistake of buying the Lush scent (purple bottle) when I bought it at the store. Something told me to stick with the Fresh scent but I was feeling adventurous and curious.                                                                     From now on I refuse to buy Lush scent as it's very weak and doesn't last as long as the Fresh scent."
5.00,"Very nice product to add to your wash - gives clothes a nice, clean, fresh smell. I add it to all my laundry."
5.00,"My spouse loves Downy Unstoppables! Very easy too use ! Pricey, but makes laundry smell clean and fresh! Try it!"
5.00,"Lush scent is ahhhhmazing!!  I am crazy about this stuff!  It smells so great and lingers for a long time."
2.00,"for starters, This is not a fabric softener. Downy unstoppables are an in-wash scent booster                                                                     They look like pieces of Nerds candy that you add to the start of your load to provide a long lasting scent.                                                                     While it smells great and does provide a nice fresh scent, it doesn't last. I used it on a blanket. the smell wore off after just 2 days. so I really wouldn't consider it \"lasting\". I tried using more the 2nd time I washed my blanket - same.                                                                     I've had bounce dryer sheets &amp; febreeze's freshness last a lot longer. so I can't really recommend this."
5.00,"This is my favorite of the Unstopable scents. It keeps my laundry smelling super fresh and is a lifesaver when washing gym clothes (and not using fabric softener)."
5.00,"Love THIS Product,,Keeps Clothes Fresh Smelling For Weeks,,,,Only Product I Will Use !!,,Would Like To Seer More Scents Offered By Downy !!"
5.00,"Will make your clothes smell absolutely wonderful and the smell will last a few washes. What more can I say."
5.00,"These smell amazing. You can stand at your closet door and just inhale the wonderful aroma after you've put these in a few loads. It's great."
3.00,"This does give my laundry a nice smell when it comes out of the washer and dryer, but the smell doesn't last more than a day or two."
5.00,"I got this originally with a special bonus buy and now use them on all my sheets and towels to keep them fresher longer. I just pulled out a sheet set that I washed two weeks ago from the closet and they smell like they were just washed today. LOVE IT!"
5.00,"looove how amazing my clothes smell using the unstopables all of the scents :)"
5.00,"My girls love the sent of these products. They keep clothes fresh even after outdoor play! They each have different scents."
5.00,"I tried this for the first time as a free sample sent out by Downy. I loved it so much that I immediately ordered some from amazon.com. My towels sometimes smell stale from sitting in the linen closet for a while. After adding this to the washer, they smell wonderful and freshly laundered. I highly recommend this product!"
5.00,"I love the way Downy Unstoppables make my laundry smell, and this is my favorite of all the scents. I'm addicted now and add it to every load of laundry I do."
4.00,"I enjoy making my own laundry soap but my husband doesn't like that the clothes don't come out smelling like store bought detergent, so this product was our solution. I like that it is easy to use and not messy. I wish the scent was even stronger. That is why I didn't give it the full 5 stars."
5.00,"I love these. They smell good, and they make my clothes smell really good. Not sure the effect they have on my machine yet, but I like them."
4.00,"Downy Unstoppables does what it claims...the \"flavor\" lasts for a looong time.                                                                     It's easy to use, just throw a capful in when you begin the load of laundry. The little capsules break down and do their thing, imparting scent throughout the load.                                                                     The only drawback is the scent of the Unstoppable tends to compete with the scent of the detergent, until the detergent cries \"Uncle!\" and the Unstoppable scent takes over.                                                                     For those of you who like the clean scent of fresh laundry, this is a great product for you. If you wear any sort of perfume or aftershave on a regular basis, this product will interfere.                                                                     All in all, I like it and will continue to purchase and use this product."
2.00,"I was so excited to try these as I absolutely LOVE Downy Unstopables and wish they had more scents. So when I saw this I couldn't wait to try it. I am a seasonal person and use the blue/green ones and the pink ones in the spring and summer. In the fall and winter I like heavier scents so I use the light pink (lush?) and the purple. These smell very good, however it doesn't work nearly as well as they other unstopables do. You can barely smell it in your clothes at all. I was extremely disappointed. So instead of using them in my clothes I put a few in my vacuum to help make the house smell less like kids and animals. In my opinion, the purple smells just as good, is stronger and lasts much longer."
2.00,"Did not like the smell of this product, plus I found a much cheaper brand that smells better, and lasts longer on clothes."
5.00,"I love this stuff. It makes my linens and clothes smell so fresh, not just per fumy!! You wont be disappointed!"
5.00,"Great smell and long lasting smell. Even works as a freshner if added to water and put in a spray bottle and sprayed on fabrics."
5.00,"I would recommend this to everyone. I love the smell and while it's washing you have wonderful aroma in your house. I also recommend Gain."
5.00,"Unstopables reallywork! I love the smell that scents the room when my clothes are washing. I would recommend to anyone"
2.00,"This product destroyed my comforter.  It didn't dissolve like it was suppose to and now my comforter is all marked up and can't be fixed.  I used this on my clothes and towels without a problem but it attacked my bedding with a vengeance.  I wanted to like this product but can't after that."
4.00,"I actually initially bought this because my front-loader had a decidedly unclean odor.  It was fall, my kids spent most days getting dirty and/or muddy, and all of that went into the washer.  The washer did not respond very well.  I tried everything to get rid of the funk - He washer cleaners, Borax, Tide packets, nothing worked.  Another reviewer recommended these, so I thought, hey, why not?  Unstoppables actually worked!  The funk is gone, and the clothes have a nice lavender scent. I love it on the towels and sheets.  I don't wash my husband's work shirts in this, as he does not really want to smell like a flower, but otherwise I LOVE this product.  I sprinkle a little into each load.  There is no residue and the fragrance really is mellow, not overwhelming like you'd think when first opening the bottle.                                              The only drawback has been the cost - I wish it were not quite so pricey for an additive.  I do note that the price here fluctuates.  On occasion it's been far less here than at our local household store, and sometimes it's a dollar or three more."
5.00,"My mom got a free sample of this and I loved it so I bought some more! I love using this for my dance wear to keep them smelling fresh."
5.00,"I am obsessed with these things! I use them in ever load of laundry! I tried to only put them in with certain items: towels, bedding... things that I don't wash everyday. But now I cant do a load of laundry without them! I love the clean scent that fabric holds. I have been purchasing them since they came out and don't plan to stop. This is one item that I tell my friends and family about - and have gotten many many people hooked. My little girls love them too! they both still use a blanky, so its nice dragging the blankets around and having them smell fresh even two weeks after washing them. I am currently subscribing to them to get the additional discount - help me justify using an additive in my laundry. Side note - you still use your regular fabric softener, detergent, etc. These are simply just thrown in with your laundry in the same area you put your clothes in the wash. They aren't meant to clean, just meant to leave youe stuff smelling fresh for weeks. HIGHLY recommend. These are the best things ever!"
5.00,"I LOVE this product. I don't use much per load, but it does the trick to keep my laundry smelling fresh. It is a great compliment to my fabric softener"
5.00,"Ok, so when I saw this on the Vine Program I immediately jumped on it, I have been wanting to try these for a while now and I was waiting to see who would be cheaper (Amazon or Wal-Mart) when I saw the price online and saw the price in Wal-Mart it was a no brainer. (My Wal-Mart has these for $6.97). I live in an apartment complex so I have been looking for something to make my laundry have a really nice scent. I am a Gain fan and realized that their fabric softeners are not as strong as their detergents, so I have been using Downy fabric softener with Gain detergent. This has been working GREAT, so I figured I would give these crystals a try. Low and behold they are AMAZING; however I didn't use a scented softener with these crystals, because they already had a nice scent. I used an original scented softener and added the crystals all in together. My clothes came out smelling magnificent; they had a fresh and crisp smell to them. I even went back and washed my sheets (even though I washed them last week) so they could have the same scent. The reason I use a softener with them, is because the directions do not state that the crystals are a fabric softener, it states it's a scent booster and I like my clothes to feel soft and smooth, so if you want to use these instead of fabric softener then I am giving you a heads up, the scent will come through (maybe not as strong), but your clothes may not be nice and soft."
5.00,"I'm a man but that doesn't mean I like musty smelling clothes, these Downy Scent Boosters last for over a month. I got a free sample and I thought \"what the heck\", now I'm hooked on them. The Fresh scent reminds me of Bounce sheets but the scent from these crystals last longer, fresh smelling but not too foo-foo. It even gets rid of those funky sneaker odors."
5.00,"This stuff smells so good. I don't usually like plain lavender scents, but this lavender is sweeter; it reminds me of the Lavender & Vanilla Odor Eliminating Wallflower at B&BW. And it is very longlasting. It's especially good for sheets or clothing that will be stored for awhile and not used often, as it keeps them smelling fresh."
5.00,"We really enjoy using these! They keep our clothes smelling fresher, longer, and are easy to use. Instead of buying scented laundry soap (which by the time the clothes rinse hardly has any scent left) or buying watered down soap, just sprinkle in a few of these. The scent also lasts through the dryer and into your closet! We've tried all scents and this is our most favorite"
1.00,"Let me start off by saying, I really wanted to love this product. I used it first on my sheets, comforter and towels. The smell is heavenly! Unfortunately, I developed such a bad rash almost instantly, that I had to see a doctor. An unstoppable, itchy, red, blotchy, mess. My skin just does NOT like this product. Very sad. Not sure what they put in it that caused me to have such a bad reaction, but if you are the type to be sensitive to perfumes, dyes and fragrance even in the slightest bit, do NOT use this product. I repeat, do not use this product."
5.00,"I love Tide I haven't been able to find Downy with lavender scent When I found this Tide product I was very happy!"
4.00,"I love the smell, but just take care that you don't use too many. In most of the HE washers I've tried these in, they don't dissolve completely but leave a clumpy residue. Just a little goes a long way."
5.00,"I love this line of Downey to use on towels and other items that I don't use fabric softener on. I use white towels, so even with bleach in the load, they come out smelling awesome from this add in product. The spring scent is just delicious. The scent lasts, so linens or towels still smell great after a few weeks. I haven't tested it any longer than that so I can't really say if the scent sticks around for months. This is my favorite scent so far. Keep up the good work Downey!"
5.00,"I have this on autoship. I don't use them in all loads because I don't like to add cost to my laundry. However, I do always use them when I do towels and bedding. There is nothing like cuddling up with your favorite blanket and it smells so good!"
5.00,"My daughter-in-law was using this when I was visiting. Very surprising to find how long it will last. Great for bath towels, hand towels, ect... So fresh smelling."
1.00,"Dont really get this crap It;s a lot of money for something that does next to nothing !!! Puh-lease get lost"
5.00,"These things smell so great and floral! They last a while in my clothes too keeping the closet fresh. Way better than the outrageously suffocating blue ones."
5.00,"Bought this originally to try-loved it. Have had it on my subscribe and save ever since. Personally, I use it in the rinse cycle instead of the wash just to intensify the aroma. Would definitely recommend."
5.00,"I love this product. It should be cheaper to the consumer because it is a little bit pricey. This is my favorite scent."
5.00,"We live on a well and I am not fond of the way our laundry smells after time. This I add liberally to our wash and our towels, bedding and clothes stay fresh for WEEKS! I must admit, this isn't my favorite scent, I prefer the pink cap but it is very nice."
5.00,"Unstopables are really unstopable! You add a the correct amount directly into your washer and the magic happens. No more wondering if the smell of your favorite sent is really going to stay, with this product, the smell lasts for weeks! Of course be sure you really like the smell because it may take a few washes to get it out."
5.00,"I didn't think that these boosters would work any different than detergent or softener. I was wrong!                                                                     They are easy to use and don't leave any stains, which I was also concerned with.                                                                     The smell is delightful, especially on nicely heated fresh towels."
5.00,"Clean, fresh scent that you add at the beginning of the wash cycle. Makes your laundry smell so clean -- don't know how I lived without this!"
4.00,"These are quite nice and definitely do work as advertised, though you need about a capful for a full load of laundry for you to be able to smell any sort of persisting scent. I'd suggest using them on towels and bedsheets, otherwise I don't think they're really necessary on clothes."
3.00,"FRAGRANCE IS GOOD! PRICE IS TOO HIGH FOR JUST A GOOD OK RATING. If the price was lower, I would purchase again."
5.00,"Ive tried alot of different products/fragrances, and this one by far is the best one. Love the scent, and all my clothes smell so good, especially my pillowcase. You will love this product as much as I do."
5.00,"I got a sample of this a couple of weeks ago and finally tried it yesterday. We've got a lot of cats (rescued) and the odor that goes with them. I wash towels and throw rugs often. I think using this long lasting scent is going to help. A lot. And maybe they won't like the smell and will use the litterbox, which I wish they'd be using anyway.                                                                     It's on my list for my next shopping trip."
5.00,"I love this stuff so much. Sweaters that I put away in boxes for a year still smell good! I try to ration it out so it will last longer (using it on sheets and towels only), but I really love to use it on everything. I have a friend who was afraid to start using it because she knew she would become addicted to it, too. So I bought her some as a gift. True story. It's good stuff."
5.00,"My fabric softener was causing my HE front loader to get nasty build up. I used softener for the fresh smell. These scent boosters give me the fresh smell without the build up. A little pricey if you use in every load"
5.00,"I LOVE DOWNY UNSTOPPABLES I ONLY USE IT FOR MY SHEETS, TOWELS, BLANKETS..ETC..THE SCENT LASTS FOREVER"
4.00,"I love this product. I think it's a must-have item for anyone using a shared laundry room. It helps to keep the linens smelling fresh (never a mildew or old machine smell). I like it because it's fresh without being overwhelming.   That said, I use a little less than recommended because I think it might be wearing out my laundry, but I'm not really sure. Also note that this isn't a fabric softener or soap of any kind, just scented dissolvable beads."
5.00,"I bought this and use it with my laundry and the way it makes the clothes smell is amazing. Way better than the liquid Downy. If you want your clothes to smell great get this!"
4.00,"I like my laundry to smell fresh and clean. However, I'm chemically sensitive and sometimes artificial scents really make me ill.  I don't have problems with regular Downy so thought I'd give this a shot and see how it would be                                                                     For some reason I thought it would be a liquid, but its pretty little pellets of scent. When you open the bottle, the smell is STRONG, which is a good thing because that means a little goes a long way!  You can start with just a small amount like a teaspoon and then work you way up. If you like super scented sheets-add more. It was GREAT to get 'dog' smell out of my Chihuahua's dog beds as well.                                                                     It makes the entire house smell clean and fresh when you do a load of laundry, thats an added benefit.                                                                     Overall I think its s good product and really not too expensive for how long it will last."
2.00,"This is supposed to be a scent booster that goes directly into your washing machine with your dirty laundry and laundry detergent. As long as you have a great smelling laundry detergent and fabric softener there is really no need to use this. I tired it without using the fabric softener sheets after the end of a wash and the scent did not last very long. Drying my clothes with my bounce sheets actually last a lot longer than this did. Save your money and get a really nice good laundry detergent that you like the smell of and fabric softener/sheets."
5.00,"Smells amazing! Will always use in my laundry . Well worth the money and extra effort of using ! Love it"
5.00,"Oh how I love this product. Doing laundry right now and it just smells wonderful and fresh. Highly recommend! Also doesn't irritate my fairly sensitive skin surprisingly."
5.00,"Our clothes smell great for weeks after washing. It's such a refreshing feeling to pull an item from the drawer or closet and get a whiff of a pleasant fragrance, even if the item hasn't been recently laundered."
1.00,"Does anyone care about buying a misspelled product? There doesn't seem to be a pun, so it looks more like a lot of quality control went by the wayside and if they can't even spell a word right on their packaging, are they being conscientious about what goes inside?"
4.00,"This is one of the very best products on the market. Sadly though, it's far too expensivefor me to use!"
5.00,"I make homemade laundry Detergent and am happy to find these to scent it with. They smell wonderful. I heated mine slightly to melt them in the microwave for ease in blending, and my kitchen smelled wonderful all day"
5.00,"This one is the very best!! The scent is retained until you wear it again!! Can't ever be without it!!"
5.00,"I love this scent. I have also tried the fresh scent but this one is the best. I mainly use this for blankets sheets and towels. If it was cheeper I would add this to everything. My sheets still smell wonderful a week later when I take them off."
5.00,"I got two free samples of the Downy fresh scent (blue one) and I was a little hesitant to use it since people said theirs left residue, etc. So I decided to try the first sample on a load of towels because who cares if you ruin towels, right? The towels usually get a funky closet smell after sitting in the linen closet for a long time. My towels STILL smell really amazingly fresh and I catch a whiff of them every time I open the closet. There was no residue on them whatsoever either. I've even used my shower towel for a week and I can still smell the Downy unstoppable smell on the towel, even after so many uses.   I figured maybe I just got lucky so I tried the second sample on a blanket that the dog uses and smells like dog butt. Surely nothing can cover the smell of stinky wet dog tush. Well, Unstoppables did it again. I am currently curled up under a fluffy, fresh-smelling, warm blanket fresh out of the dryer and my dog can't have it back anymore. He likes the smell too because as soon as I put the blanket on the bed while I folded some other clothes, he flopped around on it and rubbed his face in it and wouldn't get off the dang blanket when I wanted him to. No weird residue on the blanket either.   I don't know how the other scents are but I recommend sticking with the blue one. It's a lovely fresh smell and it really sticks to the laundry. This blanket gets daily use and I look forward to it smelling fresh and keeping the living room smelling fresh (BIG Downy smell, tiny apartment) for a while!"
5.00,"Never thought I'd buy this. When it came out, I thought it was expensive and that I wouldn't use it. But I received a sample in the mail and I couldn't wait to get to the store to buy some. I have already recommended it and have a few friends using it now as well. WELL worth the money!"
5.00,"Great product for laundry. Smell really good the laundry after cleaning. Its a little bit expensive, you can find cheaper ones... but for the one can pay it, its perfect"
5.00,"But the scent is very nice and it makes me feel good about how I do my laundry. I'm unsure about the duration of the fresh scent but it does smell nice when removed from the dryer..."
5.00,"I have been using these pearls for a few weeks now and I adore them, recently I had a friend over and in a rush I pulled a tee-shirts out from my closet on a Saturday so I could be presentable after cleaning all morning , I washed that tee on Monday, my fried walked in an hugged me and asked if I just did laundry because it smelled so good, funny thing is that I just threw this on but I did use the pearls on this when I was pouring the detergent, they make everything smell lovely and feel soft . Very easy to use, just dump into washed when you add liquid and expect extra soft scent and luxurious hand feel, I will be getting more when I run out for sure! It makes anything you wash with it smell soft and clean, very nice waterlily scent for a hectic lifestyle or for anyone who likes a little something extra nice in their laundry."
1.00,"I bought this product after watching it's very nice commercial but it came out sooooooooo bad. I don't recommend this product to anyone because it is expensive as well doesn't work at all. It doesn't smell anything. I am highly disappointed."
5.00,"Got this for my laundry, new product and love this scent. This scent lasts a long time and does make clothes smell fresh even weeks later. Yum ! !"
2.00,"I enjoy Downy products and like a fresh light fragrance in my wash -  this Downy Unstoppable Fresh Scent Booster was overpowering and over the top for me."
4.00,"One thing I dislike is to grab a towel out of the cupboard a week or so after washing it, and finding that the fresh, just-washed scent is no longer there. Yeah, the towel is clean and I can still use it, but it's just not as enjoyable.                                                                     With Downy Scent Booster, I can grab that towel, even a week or more later, and it will still smell like it just came out of the dryer. I love that!                                                                     It's also nice to know that I can give my laundry and extra boost of \"freshness\" when I'm washing things like work clothes or sneakers....things that are generally a little more smelly in the wash.                                                                     It's not an \"essential\" buy, but something that, if you can afford it, is a nice indulgence."
5.00,"I got this from Amazon Vine a few weeks ago, and I used it right away. You could totally smell a difference!! My clothes and towels smelled wonderful after using this product. The only bad things i can think of would be that it was a very small amount for $11.00 dollars, like maybe five or six loads of laundry. I would def buy this again, though not from amazon (price is way too high)."
4.00,"I just recently used  my sample of \"Unstopables\" I like them but to be honest they kind of smell like men's body wash. The sample packet said it was for 1 load. THANKFULLY I did not put the whole thing in the load, just using 1/4 of it and after the clothes came out of the washer the scent was overpowering to me. I wish the scent would be less cologne smelling and more of a \"softer freshness\". I would use these for sheets or bath towels, but not for my everyday clothes. Since I'm a woman I wouldn't want someone 3 feet away to think I had put on men's cologne."
5.00,"I've used these awesomely scented little things for about 2 years now. They are decently priced and make our laundry smell TOTALLY WONDERFUL!!!"
5.00,"I use this in my homemade detergent all the time. Lush is my favorite scent. Very perfumy and clean. I love highly scented laundry and this does it every time."
5.00,"I have fallen in love with this product after using them on my boyfriends socks. I am always telling him \"you need new socks\", the smell would never come out. Then if i leave them in the washer overnight and I forget to put them in the dryer they would smell even worse. Ever since I got these I can leave clothes for 2 days without smelling like mildew. This is the ONLY thing that will get the smell out of socks. i couldn't believe how good the socks smelled afterwards even my boyfriend was amazed. Now I just need to find them a little cheaper though amazon would be my best bet... doesn't seem like it though."
5.00,"Well, I don't know why Amazon lists this as a stain remover also, it doesn't do that - lol - but it is TERRIFIC at making my clothes smell wonderful. You use this in the washing machine in your normal wash cycle; it's easy, they dissolve completely. No staining or residue that I have detected. Highly recommend."
5.00,"After my daughter was born I noticed that laundry detergents were too harsh for her skin, so for the past 11 years we have been using All Free &amp; Clear detergent. It gets our laundry clean but my I miss smelling the fresh scent on my clothes from using regular detergents. I have been using dryer sheets for my loads of clothes, but the scent wears off quickly.              I decided to give the Downy Unstopables a try. I bought the Fresh Scent booster. I used about 12 beads from the bottle and LOVED the smell of my clothes as they came out of the dryer. The scent lasts all day! The bottle lasts a long time since you only need 12 beads or so per load.              Now I am able to get the scent I love on my clothes and continue to use the free &amp; clear detergents on all our laundry to protect my daughters skin. It is much easier to use the same detergent and then add the Downy Unstopables to my loads than to have two big bottles of detergent in the laundry room - and the scent is much better! (Also I will add that I my daughters skin had not been bothered by the Downy on my clothes - she is only effected by long term contact to detergents. I am not sure how it would effect others with sensitivities to laundry detergents.)"
5.00,"This is my favorite unstoppable smell, and I can't find it anywhere else. The blankets come out smelling clean and it just brightens the whole room with the fragrance."
4.00,"the smell doesn't last long in clothes but in sheets, pillow, towels, smell lasts a long time. also makes the dog beds smell really good and keeps everything soft and totally static free. i can't live without them now."
1.00,"I was looking and just to let you know it is cheaper at walmart $5.99 just alittle info so go to walmart or Publix it is also $5.99"
4.00,"I like the product - just wish I didn't go through so much at a time. Will need to replenish this product on a monthly basis."
5.00,"I have cats and no matter what I do I can always smell them on my clothes. Once I started using Unstopables the smell is gone and they stay fresh. Just gives the clothes an added boost of freshness"
5.00,"I love the smell of these. I do think it's a little expensive but I'll still buy it because it smells so good and makes my laundry smell great."
5.00,"This is one of my splurge purchases. I make my own laundry detergent with washing soda, fels naptha, borax, baking soda, and oxiclean. I find that that is a cheap, but great laundry solution for a big family. However, I want the \"clean laundry\" smell that my homemade detergent doesn't give me. I LOVE the Downy Unstopables--it just smells like luxury. Also, sometimes if I leave my clothes in the basement too long after washing and folding (too lazy to carry up stairs sometimes, lol) then get a musty, basement smell to them, but I find that when I use the unstopables, they keep the \"fresh laundry\" smell for almost 3x longer than just normal detergent/fabric softener."
5.00,"I love this product. The lush scent smells amazing, kind of a lavender/floral scent. I wish downy would sell a room refresher in this scent!! The product is easy to use, you can use as little or as much as you want in your wash and it leaves a lasting scent. Love it."
5.00,"I only use the downy unstopables on our bath towels, it makes them smell so fresh! Nothing like stepping out of the shower and wrapping yourself in a fresh fluffy towel, that smells GREAT!"
5.00,"Great buy, a little cheaper than buying in the stores and it come right to your door. You can't beat it."
5.00,"I would recommend the Downy Unstopables In Wash Fresh Scent Booster...I would buy again...Love the smell.....Its easy ,just fill cup up and dump into washing machine... Add first before the clothes... Jackie :)"
4.00,"I just starting using this and I love the freshness of my clothes, I will buy this product again."
4.00,"So for some reason this scent is never on sale at Walmart or any other store we can find it (not even all stores carry this one). Amazon's price on this stuff is better than the normal prices (but no better than sale prices for the other scents)."
5.00,"I really like this!  I actually put it into the washer before the clothes, and it gives my laundry room a nice scent.                                                                     It certainly isn't for people who don't want a scent on their clothes. If you do, you'll like the nice fresh scent from the product.                                                                     It lasts a long time, because a little goes a long way. You can also use this quality to choose how much scent you add.                                                                     The one disadvantage I see is an absence of softening agents. In other words, this is a perfume, not a fabric softener. So, you'll have to use something else for that, and their scents might conflict.                                                                     Recommended.                                                                     Sean P. Logue, 2011"
5.00,"My Mother has irritable bowel syndrome and her clothes and bedding get to smell real bad even though I wash them and use fabric softener. I tried this and it takes the smell out of her clothes and bedding."
5.00,"This is similar to lavender scent.  Though I'm currently on a lavender kick such as the Mr. Clean Lavender cleaner.  I like this on my sheets but I skip it for the pillow covers for fear it would be too strong near the head.  I enjoy my clothes smelling so fresh when I put them on in the morning.  I do with the price here on Amazon was lower. Perhaps they will offer a subscribe and save soon."
1.00,"I was highly disappointed, I couldn't smell anything, I smelled more when I used Bounce dryer sheets. I used a full cup as well, and the smell was only there when wet, once dry, the scent went away. I am editing this because apparently the blue seems to work and smell more and better than the purple...haven't tried the blue yet though...as for the Lavender...couldn't smell a thing."
5.00,"I received a sample of these and tried them out, while I am not a fabric softener user at all. Turns out I have decided I can't live without it now. After a week my sheets still smell amazing!!! So good!"
5.00,"I love the unstaoppables. I love the smell and it does not bother my skin , Excellent product would recommended to a friend or family member highly. Excellent price cant beat it!"
4.00,"Downy Unstopables is a great product, and works well. The only reason I only gave it 4 stars is because it has a higher price than other brands. The little \"pellets\" really make a difference in my laundry, and the scent lasts at least a week. For some reason I can't buy this product at my local grocery store--they don't have any shelf space for new laundry products."
1.00,"SMELL IS SO LIGHT USE AN ENTIRE BOTTLE PER WASH AND DO NOT EXPECT IT TO LAST FOR ANY AMOUNT OF TIME. PAYING THIS KIND OF PRICE FOR A PRETTY BOTTLE IS NOT ENTERTAINING."
1.00,"I've purchased this from the store and in all honesty, I cannot say that this product is at all worth the money -$6.97 large, $4.97 small/med (called \"Tester). I've tested it using a little (as the bottle says) to double the amount (over what the bottle says) to half a bottle use, then in the last experiment, to whole bottle use. The Experiment: As for washing/drying: (cold water in washer, high heat in dryer) - during the experiment, laundry deg without perfumes used. No dryer sheets or other perfumes were used. Experiment did over a course of 2 weekends. With 3 to 4 medium loads of laundry each for 3 adults. Usual clothes, nothing outlandish. I used $4.97 (tester) for 1st weekend, then $6.97 start of 2nd weekend, then another $6.97 for last (had a coupon) - two different smells. Washer and dryer are both 3 years old, but not HE. Reason: I wanted to see if it really did as it claimed, because to me, just looking at it, it wouldn't, without using other products alongside it. 1st weekend) Using the first small amount as the bottle says (half cap), in it's directions, did nothing for the clothes but left a small hint, probably not even noticeable by some, once washed. I was used to the smell while moving the clothes to the dryer, so it was gone before I even started the dry cycle. Once fully dried, the smell was gone. 1st weekend) Using the first small amount then a little more, such as half of the first small amount (almost full cap, but not completely), will do the same thing as the first. Leave a small hint of smell. Once dried, it's gone. 1st weekend) Using double the amount as the first (one whole cap full then half cap) left the smell in the clothes once washed, but once dried, nothing, it was gone. Completely. 2nd weekend) Using one whole cap, plus another in the wash (2 caps full), left smell long enough to move to dryer, but once dried, nothing, once again. Downy Unstopables In Wash Fresh Scent Booster 13.2 Oz New bottle - used half. 2nd weekend) Using half the bottle in the wash, leaves smell on clothes. Left some white hue on some clothes. Not all of the product was dissolved in the washer. Found some on clothes and in the washer itself. Once dried, left a hint. Downy Unstopables In Wash Spring Scent Booster Laundry Fabric Softener, 13.2 Ounce New bottle - used full bottle. 2nd weekend) Left clothes smelling like bottle fragrance once washed, but also left a small white cloud hue on some. Came off with wet wash cloth or another washing, if it were bad (only had 2 that were bad). Only noticeable on non-white items. Just like before, some of the product didn't get dissolved in the water. Some was found on stick on the clothes and in bottom of washer, either laying there or stick to the sides. Had some hint of smell once dried. Smell lasted about 25 to 30 minutes while folding. Checked to see if towels were still smelling the next day about an hour or so after, had a hint, but didn't last long as the bottle claims, which is until your next wash. Smell was gone by the next day. Did not even leave the closet smelling nice, like when I use Bounce. My conclusion: The product smells really nice (all do; depending on your senses) while still in the bottle. I believe they'd work well for making your closet, bathroom or any small place smell nice, for a couple of hours - not days. It does not remove odors. To get any hint of smell after wash and dry, you literally will have to do what Downy is marketing, which is \"mix and match scents\" and products - which to me, is a lot to spend every time you do laundry. So all in all, a waste of money by itself. You would literally have to purchase Tide deg (owned by P&G), Unstopables (owned by P&G), Downy fabric softener (owned by P&G) and then Downy/Bounce dryer sheets (owned by P&G) for the smell to stick around longer, and the smells would have to \"match\". Hope my experiment helped someone :) a little side note.. their spelling of Unstopables; is just... *sigh*"
5.00,"My daughter told me about this product. I've always been a Downy Fabric Softener user. I love the smell and the way the clothes and towels feel soft. Adding Downy Unstopables to my laundry regiment just increased the clean smell of my laundry. I use it for every load and have recommended it to several people already!"
4.00,"I make my own laundry detergent but needed something to make it smell better and these work amazingly. They smell SO good and with a family of four this bottle lasts a good amount of time. They are a little bit more than I wanted to spend but you can almost always find a $1 off coupon for these which make it a little better."
5.00,"Right so I've used other versions of these scent boosters from other brands, and I've liked them just fine. In particular, I've used the other brands both directly in my washer with store-bought laundry soap and in my own homemade laundry soap recipe. I've found that the other brand (Purex) worked well in my homemade soap, but didn't do so well with the store bought detergent - it just didn't last long enough. That wasn't the case at all with these Downy Unstopables! A little bit goes a long way with these, which is great because they're a little bit pricier than their competition. Bonus: the scent lasts a very long time! My closet smells fantastic after using these. I've tried a few of the Downy Unstopable scents and the Glow scent is my favorite. It smells clean without smelling chemically or fake."
5.00,"nothing wrong w/ my orders pretty much ever.... it cleans..i love not having to drive to the store.. saves me a trip!"
5.00,"I first tried a one wash sample pack that came on a bottle of Tide and after getting half way through my first bottle I LOVE it. My husband and I workout everyday and get really sweaty but I only do laundry once a week. All that sweat sitting on our clothes for 2-6 days was starting to set in but I didn't want to do laundry more often. This is totally saving us. This get's those stinky marinated in sweat clothes super fresh every wash and even after a workout you can still smell a faint trace of the product. I never use more than half a cap full no matter how much freshening I need.I love it. It is now a laundry must half."
5.00,"This is the best thing to add to your laundry. The good smell last for weeks. Try it, you will like it. GP"
5.00,"This really gives a lasting fragrance to clothes but it is quite pricey. I alternate between this and cheaper version (which is good but not as good as this). Walmart does have the price I have found so far, even using coupons."
5.00,"This is great but the product needs to be added to detergent so as to not add another bottle to landfill."
5.00,"If you love for your laundry to smell super fresh, this is the product for you. I originally purchased this at the market and fell in love with the scent. However, I did not fall in love with the price... So glad I found this bargain on Amazon. I bought 2 for under 7$ each. At the store, its 8$ and some change. Some places even higher. Will be purchasing from here,  from now on."
1.00,"I stopped using this product once I started having skin irritations resulting from my my clothes in this product. Not recommended."
5.00,"I thought washing my husbands fishing clothes was a lost cause. No matter how much detergent I used it was no use, they still came out stinking of bait and dead fish. Then I received a sample of unstoppables in the mail and thought, what the hay, can't hurt to try. Man am I glad I did!! I was able to put my nose right on the fishing clothes and not gag lol. They smell amazing! I will definitely be adding this to my laundry musts. I tried the fresh sent but am looking forward to trying the other scents as well."
5.00,"THE PRICE WAS RIGHT AND THIS ITEM SMELLS SO GOOD."
1.00,"used the unstopables in my HE washer and they did not dissolve and left little grease looking spots on my comforter and pillow cases. Will not be using this again!"
4.00,"This is little beads of scent that you pour right into your wash water then add your detergent.  I would suggest you use 1/2 cap full to start.  Then when I toss clothes in the dryer, I use unscented/hypoallergenic dryer sheets as my preference...seems to work out better because you are getting a scent from these beads. The scent doesn't seem to be a problem with my allergies, maybe because it was washed in the fabric and not dryed in from the dryer.  After a few loads of laundry, I have decided to use these for certain items, like that blanket for the back of the couch, or our jackets, and some seasonal clothing that I am presently washing before storing for next season.  I think it is too costly for everyday clothing that I will put in the hamper at night."
5.00,"Simple to use, works great. Just sprinkle a little in each load of laundry, and the scent is evident on the laundry coming out. It doesn't smell perfumy, just fresh."
5.00,"I got a sample of this product when I last purchased Tide liquid detergent. I used it almost immediately and I am so impressed!! My washer &amp; dryer are on my garage and not only did my garage smell like 'Fresh Scent' Unstopables, so did my entire house! My clothes smell so fresh and crisp I just can't get over it. The package said for the ultimate experience to combine the unstopables with liquid downy, which I did not do. I can't imagine how amazing it would be if I had done that!                                                                     I also reviewed this product on my blog: &lt;...&gt;"
4.00,"I have been using these with my el-cheapo washer for months now. Works really well on the washers that don't have the separate softener compartment ."
5.00,"I'm constantly washing my clothes between working out and wearing scrubs at the hospital. Those are smells that I do not want left on my clothes! Downy did a great job in creating this product."
5.00,"I love this laundry scent booster. I've tried one other, which did not have the lasting effect that Downy Unstoppable did. I can take my clothes out of the closet, or a drawer weeks later and they still smell fresh like the scent! Ahhh! Please, try this, it's the best thing to ever happen to laundry! I haven't tried the purple or pink versions yet, but soon will."
4.00,"Target deals<br/><br/>Tide Pods 35 ct or Gain Flings - $9.99<br/>Buy four, get two 9.7 oz Downy Unstopables or Gain Fireworks... http://t.co/EqvJJ8Rycn"
5.00,"I LOVE THESE! The smell is phenomenal, it lasts until I have to wash again. I don't have to use any body spray or anything to cover up the \"dryer smell\" because all you can smell is the unstopables. They should be cheaper, but we will deal. Coupons help that."
4.00,"Smells wonderful but doesn't last but only a couple weeks. It's still worth the smell though! Haven't tried any other brands to compare it to yet."
5.00,"Keeps clothes smelling fresh and clean for weeks! How I ever got along without it before is beyond me! !"
5.00,"I absolutely love the green unstoppables. The smell is amazing and lasts a long time. Even though I'm a smoker people still smell the unstoppables rather than my smoke. Thanks downy for keeping my families clothes fresh!"
5.00,"Love this Downy product. It really works and last 2-3 weeks after the wash. It also is so easy to use just put it in the washer before you put your clothes in to wash."
5.00,"I use this product in my washer The scent is fabulous and my clothes come out smelling great...would recommend this to every one."
5.00,"One of my sons came home from college and as he was passing me I smelled something wonderful. I said what smells so good and he told me about unstopables. Best thing ever!!!!!!! I use it now all the time!"
4.00,"These Gain Flings and Downy Unstopables got my laundry rm and clothes smelling sooooooo good."
5.00,"My family loves these scent boosters. I use fragrance free laundry products with the exception of these beads, and the scent lasts for weeks. My kids especially love it when I use this on their sport uniforms as the smell releases more as the fabric warms up."
1.00,"The tiny beads do not all dissolved. I found pieces attached to my clothing, especially sweaters. I prefer the liquid vesion."
5.00,"We live and work on a dairy farm and our work clothes get filthy dirty and smelly. When I add a capful of this into my hot wash water with my favorite Era detergent it makes even our dirtiest work clothes smell great. When I'm doing a load of laundry or drying a load, I can even smell this throughout my house.                                                                     I now love to walk into my closet as when I walk in I can smell the great fresh scent of Downy. It makes all your clothes smell so fresh and clean. Besides getting the dirtiest, smelliest work clothes smelling great, it's especially great for getting towels and bed sheets snuggly fresh.                                                                     The container this is in is really user friendly. It has a removable measuring cap on top and a snapping cap on the bottle. You can use as much or as little of this as you want. For our dirtiest clothes I use almost 3/4 of a capful. For our other clothes and towels I use only 1/4 of a capful. The bottle looks deceivingly small, as this lasts through several washes. It doesn't take much of this at all to get averagely soiled clothes smelling great. I love the way my clothes smell if I use fabric softener during the rinse cycle, but, I usually too busy to put it in most of the time. So, I love that I can add this at the BEGINNING of the wash before I add the clothes and I get a better than fabric softener scent.                                                                     I absolutely love this and will definitely be repurchasing and making it a staple in my laundry room. Awesome stuff! I hope they will come out with new scents as well."
5.00,"My husband it retired and does a lot of different sports. Sometimes his clothes need a little extra help. The price so far is the same as in the store."
5.00,"I received a sample of this in the mail. Once I tried it I love the fresh smell. All my clothes and linens smell so nice. Its like sleeping on a bed of flowers."
4.00,"I love the light scent of lavender in this product, but oh what I wouldn't do for Tide to bring back my beloved Simple Pleasures line. It's been years since I've been able to buy a bottle of the Lavender and Vanilla scent, but I still think about it. Just keep hoping the execs at P&G will either bring it back, or something very similar. I know the demand is there."
5.00,"this really makes doing the laundry a little bit better. I love the way that the clothes feel and how they smell while using this product."
3.00,"I like my clothes to smell clean, and by clean I mean a light fragrant scent that lasts a bit which makes this seem a perfect fit for me. Unfortunately, it's too strong, and at this point I am using very little, well below what is suggested. I find the little round bits to be a bit of a pain too, but I use a front loader. I put them in ahead of time now because otherwise you're watching them bounce off the clothes onto the floor. One word of caution for pet owners and around kids, these things look like little hard candies. Just be cautious about dropping them anywhere."
4.00,"I washed a shirt for a friend before I sent it as a gift, and got compliments on how good it smelled. I'd say that's a win. I love that sheets and towels smell nice and fresh with these."
5.00,"He used the downy unstopables in wash fresh scent booster 13.2 oz first 2 months ago. Live in venezuela and here in my country, not sold, so buy box of 6 units can be stored without having to worry to finish this product. Downy unstopables in wash fresh scent booster 13.2 oz, left m clothing with a aroma impresionanate, with only a small amount, with soap and use it as a deodorant. Any rncon hecharlo in may (hidden) in your home to your environment deodorizes. Elimnando odors germs and leaving your environment with a real fresh aroma ... Recommend it 100%...I LIKE"
5.00,"While I don't use it often as it's a tad on the pricey side, I love to use this for towels and sheets. It gives a level of freshness that is unmatched by detergent and a dryer sheet alone. It's not overwhelming but, it is definitely there. Being that it's used in the washer (versus the dryer) makes it just as easy to use as it would be if you were putting it in the dryer. Additionally, I like that it's kind of 'use what you need' kind of product. I've figured out that with the large bottle of Unstopables, I can use about a quarter cap-full on a load of towels to achieve my desired level of scent. One warning -- if you want to hang on to the scent through the drying cycle, don't cook the article(s) in the dryer. I like to pull things out when they have just a bit of dampness left. Otherwise, by cooking them dry, I think you drive off the scent. Two huge thumbs up from this guy... will definitely buy again!"
5.00,"love this it makes every thing you wash smell so good.and it last for weeks try it and you will fall in love with it to"
5.00,"This is the most wonderfully pleasant smell on bed sheets, towels and blankets. I love laying my head down on my pillow at night and smelling the gentle, sweet lavender scent. I absolutely always wash my robe and favorite pjs with it too. I could breathe this stuff in all day long!"
5.00,"I LOVE this product. It is a bit cheaper on Amazon than in grocery stores if you are buying it as an add on. I love this scent in particular and also use it in my candle warmer. The scent stays with you for awhile and makes clothes smell fresh. Highly recommend!"
5.00,"I used the sample of Downy Unstopables and just loved it! However, I have been looking in various stores, Publix, Wal-Mart, Sam's, and I can't find it. So I bought the Purex brand . I think Downy was a bit slow on the roll out. Gave out the samples, people went looking for the product , and it couldn't be found. I won't waste my time looking for it. I'm satisfied with the Purex brand product."
5.00,"I've become addicted to certain scents and these really work. I hang all my clothes to dry, I never use a dryer. Proud to say in fact. A sprinkle is all I use so last a long time. You do not need a capful. And the scent does last a long time."
5.00,"The first time I smelled this product was when my upstairs neighbor used it and the smell came wafting through my condo. I went upstairs and asked my neighbor what that wonderful smell was. I have not been without this product since. My sheets, towels, clothes, everything in my home smells wonderful all the time now. All my company comment on the wonderful way my condo smells, which is a good thing considering I share my home with furry friends. The great lavender smell lasts from washing to washing. I love crawling in bed or wrapping myself in towels after ​a shower. I have always loved Downy, but this is their best product ever. I no longer have to watch my washer for cycles, or clean out the gum from the dispenser. This product is one that I will no longer live without."
5.00,"I use this as often as I can with my clothes. I like all the Unstopables scents, but this one is my favorite. I like that I can use a few little pellets or the whole capful depending on the level of scent I want in my clothing. Makes my comforters and sheets smell heavenly. I use less on my clothes for a subtle fresh scent. Definitely recommend the 19.5 oz vs the 13.2 oz -- better value for your money! Highly recommended for high efficiency washers -- make sure to put it in the drum!"
5.00,"I LOVE these things! They're a bit pricey to use on every load, I generally don't use them on regular clothes. However I do love to use them on towels and sheets, and my newest love...I use them on curtains. I use a lot, and it leaves my room smelling nice when I rehang the curtains after washing, and the bedrooms smell nice because of the sheets having been washed with these little pellets. I also like that they don't appear to cause any issues with people who are a little sensitive. My husband is sensitive to some detergents and softeners...there doesn't seem to be a rhyme or reason to it at all, some bother him, some don't, and thankfully, these do not! Wonderful...every time I come in the front door I get a slight whiff of the scent as I pass by the front window!"
5.00,"I love, love, love these things ! The smell lasts ! Recently donated some of my daughter's last winters clothes. They STILL had the Unstopable smell. The only thing, I'm stingy with em, always afraid I'm going to run out !"
5.00,"The other reviewer didn't even use the product before giving it a 1 star review. I recently bought this from {common chain store starts and ends with T}. The smell is very strong while in the container, but it's not bad when it's on your clothes. I was mostly concerned that it may leave oil spots or stains on my clothes but my bottle is almost empty and I have yet to have a problem with that. I came on to Amazon to see if I could get a better deal or a bulk discount because I plan on using this forever. It's cheaper to buy it in the store I originally purchased it from. If you're interested, I suggest you pick some up and if you happen to not like the end result, give it to someone else!"
5.00,"I LOVE these. They are expensive, and they really only make your clothes smell good, they don't clean or anything else. That said, I have tried other brands and just am not impressed with them. Everyone comments on how fresh from the laundry my son's clothes always smell, and I love that all day long I can smell the laundry fresh scent. It's perfume for your clothes, and it actually works! I would say it is definitely worth the couple extra dollars to get these instead of Gain or Purex. I couldn't even smell a difference with those two products."
5.00,"I use this stuff with every load of laundry that I do and love that the smell lasts for a long time afterwards."
5.00,"I bought 2 of them for my girlfriend. She loves the Downy Unstoppables! I think it may be cheaper if not the same price in the store but I had gift cards so I went ahead and got it for her. This product makes our clothes smell so good and fresh! I definitely recommend it."
5.00,"It's all in the details of self care...those extra little steps we take to make sure that everything is just right. Downy in-wash Scent Booster is a great product consisting of scent pellets that you can add as little as a single shake, directly to your wash and enjoy fresher smelling laundry long after you've put the clothes away. My favorite is the blue bottle \"Fresh Scent.\""
5.00,"I just got this product and it smells wonderful! My clothes come out of the washer smelling fresh, and I dont have to worry about adding fabric softner to the wash."
4.00,"I like this product. The smell is nice and sticks around for a while. I wish it came in more smells though as one scent gets old after a while."
3.00,"I purchased both the Blue( turquoise - Fresh Sent) and the purple-fiolet ( Lush ) the Blue fresh sent is good , the clothing still smell nice not overwhelming but the Lush sent , I don't smell anything after air drying of my clothing , and I put the cup full , it does not smelled even while washing , maybe old ? well I tried , but still like better the liquid , if you want to try go for the Blue Fresh Sent , cotton t-shirt was smelling more than other mixed fabrics will not order again , waste of money.. go for liquid as there is no 12 weeks of freshens if the clothing don;t smell after wash , nah maybe the BLUE as well but still it is waste"
3.00,"I love the Shimmer scent. It's feminine, but not overpowering. It has a light, citrusy smell. I only gave 3 stars because the scent doesn't seem to last very long, and the product is pretty expensive for something that only scents your laundry and has no other purpose. I smelled other products before purchasing this one, and this is hands-down, the best smelling scent booster I've found. Another reviewer suggested using the beads around the house and in your car as potpourri. While I love the smell, I don't think I will purchase this product again because it really doesn't do anything except smell good in the container."
3.00,"I do like the smell of this however I do not think the scent last for weeks. I knocked off a few star for the smell not really lasting as that is what the product is suppose to do. I am not sure if I am going to continue to buy this or not."
5.00,"These smell wonderful, but can have some trouble dissolving. I've learned that I can really only use these on linens. So I use the liquid Downy for my clothes and unstopables for my sheets and towels. The blue fresh scent is amazing. I can smell it on my linens for weeks! This is much appreciated since my husband is a gross sweaty beast and usually stinks up our sheets even though I swap them out once a week. This scent stays on their all week!"
3.00,"I love the way my clothes smell after using the unstoppables. The price, even on sale, seems to be high. Because of that I don't know that I would buy these again unless they were on sale somewhere and I have a coupon."
5.00,"This is my forever scent from unstopables and really keeps clothes smelling just washed even after 3 months. I havent tried any other brand to compare this to but I feel if its not broken then dont fix it."
5.00,"Ok I love good smelling clothes but most detergent's I've used just don't cut it and I usually buy what's on sale, and right now I have unscented detergent. I picked up a two pack of the fresh scent at a local retail store and first tried these on an average size load of clothes. There are 2 lines on the cap of this product, i don't know if these are meant for measuring or not, as they are never referred too, but I measured to the first, lowest line and dumped in before washing the clothes. Took the clothes out, put them in the dryer and they smelled great. Took them out of the dryer and the smelled great, but not as pronounced as I was expecting. Was a little deflating because I was expecting a more in your face scent experience. I put the clothes away in drawers and went to washing my bed sheets, mattress cover in another load and my flannel comforter after that load.                           In both of those latter loads I filled the cup to slightly more than the second line. Again, the sheets and comforter smelled good but not in your face. I put the bed sheets on and comforter on my bed and went down stairs for the rest of the evening. At this point I wasn't sure if I'd buy the product again because I wasn't wowed. Well I went up to my bedroom later that evening, about 4 or 5 hours later and as soon as i walked in the door I was hit with a fresh smell. It smelled like my whole room had been professionally cleaned. I was amazed! This is especially great considering my master is around 750 sq feet. To fill the room like it did, with such a great scent, I was sold. I took out my pajama pants out of the drawer and those also smelled great! much stronger than when straight out of the dryer. I went to bed thoroughly pleased and smelling a great scent. I woke still amazed at how great the bedding still smelled, even after a night of sleeping in it. Same goes for the pajama pants which still smell great as I type this!                           I love this product and will now use it every time I wash clothes!                           Update 12/27/12. Ok, now fully a week after I washed my bedding and it still smells great! In fact it still makes me room still smell fresh. Totally sold on these!"
4.00,"These allowed the scent to linger quite a long time. I have a washer that, when clothes come out, seems to create a nice smell but by the time the clothes are done in the dryer I have very little scent left unless I put a dryer sheet in.                                                                     These work well at keeping that fragrance alive. Easy to use - scent is quite nice. It can be a bit overpowering but it may just be an adjustment due to not usually having a smell in my clothes (unless I have worked out lol)."
5.00,"Love the smell of these, now will get these on auto delivery, I like how my laundry smells now especially the sheets and towels. Was at walmart and the cashier said she tried the other brand and it's just not as nice. She also tried the dryer ball and that was a terrible decision. Just thought I'd share that."
5.00,"I love the way Downy Unstopables makes my clothes smell. I even washed and packed my bedspread when I was getting ready to move, left it packed away for six months and when I took it out it smelled as fresh as the day I washed it with Downy Unstopables!"
5.00,"I got this stuff and promptly did a load of clothes just to see how well this worked...kind of silly I know but I love to see if stuff works as advertised and needed to do laundry bad! Anyway, this stuff IS really good at making the laundry smell incredible and for a long period of time. The fresh scent is not overwhelming at all, just right so as not to bother sensitive or allergic people. The whole family loves how the laundry just smells so much fresher even though we still use our softner it just gives a nice boost. The towels smell sooo good. Use more for more fragrance and less for well, I think you get it :  Too bad they don't make it for the dryer too!"
5.00,"Makes my clothes smell great. I use about 1/4 of a cap with every load, and it lasts for awhile."
5.00,"I love using these. My clothes come out smelling great and my laundry room smells amazing while I'm doing laundry. I sometimes do laundry just for the smell :)"
5.00,"First and foremost this product works exactly as advertised. You sprinkle a cap full in the wash and it leaves your laundry smelling terrific. Secondly, I read on Pinterest that a woman put some of these little beads in a diffuser that is usually used for essential oils. I ordered this from Amazon and since I don't have a diffuser I pour some into a candle when the was was melted. It smelled delicious!!!! According to Pinterest the beads melt like wax (which was my experience) and form a solid when they get cool. UPDATE: So far the fragrance hasn't caused any skin irritation and we are a family with very sensitive skin!!!"
5.00,"I bought these for my laundry and then read how they can be used for so much more. I have since made small sachet bags for my closets, car and as gifts. I also have placed some in my disposal to air it out and my garbage can. They can be melted by Wax Warmers to put off scent (and are much cheaper than wax bars!) A good buy with so many uses! Very happy!"
5.00,"The 13.2 ounce bottle has been hard to find lately. I am not sure why. The price was good also. I stocked up for me & my mother-in-law."
1.00,"Save your money....doesn't make your clothes smell any better than just using regular ole fabric softener. I tried adding more...then less..results were still the same. Bah humbug."
5.00,"i use this regilously my clothes smell just great..they smell good for at least a week...i would reccommend these to anyone!"
5.00,"We live in Poland and if you didn't know but washing your clothes using local detergent leaves your clothes smelling like sweat and flowers. Use this product and it takes the sweat away! Its a nice refreshing smell from home while living in Europe. Amazon prime sends them right away and I tell you the morale in my house has soared! We absolutely love it! We will buy again and when we get back stateside they will be regular purchases!!"
5.00,"Kudos to Downy for helping the detergents smell even better. The detergent pods don't have as much \"small-good, freshly laundered\" scent as the boxed loose-pak did. Well, this takes care of that problem and is easy to add for the great aroma it has when the laundry is finished."
5.00,"Love this stuff! Have been using it for years, makes all your clothes and linens smell amazing and the scent lasts! This is now a staple in my laundry room."
4.00,"I do like the smell that these things put on my clothes and towels, but I cannot imagine that it would last months like the ads say. Thus, I only get them when I find a coupon. This pink bottle smells the best, in my opinion."
4.00,"I love the idea of adding an extra touch of scent to my laundry, especially for sheets, blankets and towels. Just a sprinkle in the wash and you get an incredibly powerful scent that lasts and lasts. I was amazed at how much scent I got with just a sprinkle. It says to use a capful or less. I recommend just sprinkling a small amount at first, until you see how much you like it. It is very strong! But as someone once said \"Some is ok, some is not alot\". With such a large bottle, I know it will last me a long time. I love having fresh smelling sheets and blankets, so I used a bit more for those items than I did for my clothes. My whole laundry room was filled with fragrance. I would only recommend being cautious if you have any allergies to fragrance. It could be a bit overpowering, that is why only 4 stars.  Much better than fabric softener and scented detergent alone."
1.00,"If it turns out you are allergic to it, you can break out in hives and/or an itchy rash! Both my son and I broke out after using this in our wash. Never again!"
5.00,"I got these free as an online sample at absurdlycool.com and forgot all about it until i accidentally tossed it into the laundromat washer by accident with my clothes.  I was worried I didn't have enough detergent for my large load of clothes that I wear for work but I had already added the detergent in earlier, so even though the washer was stuffed with my large load of work clothes, I added in the sample pouch size of unstoppables.  Afterwards, I found that the pellets REALLY boosted the fragrance of my clothes.                                                                     I was also afraid like other reviewers that these small pellets would stain all over my clothes like detergent that's not mixed in well with the water OR that the pellets would somehow remain in the washer and clothes.  But somehow the pellets disappeared in the cold washer water.                                                                     You don't need a lot for a large boost of fragrance.  I like the fact that the small pellets don't weigh a lot like fabric softener liquid and that they're not messy like detergent powder since I've got a lot of clothes and laundry products already to carry to the laundromat and clean up after.  I can carry a few of these rice sized pellets in a small plastic sandwich bag, use them all up in 3 loads of laundry and then throw away the bag and not have to carry anything back and not have to clean up after these pellets.                                                                     If I see them again at my local Walgreen's or supermarket, I'll be sure to buy them, at least occasionally, even if they are kind of pricey."
3.00,"If you are sensitive to fragrances (i.e. you dread sitting between two ladies on a plane because inevitably one will wear perfume) DO NOT BUY the lush scent. The scent is horribly strong and gives me a headache. It's like being assaulted by one of those perfume shop workers in the mall, once a minute until you can change clothes. I had to wash the clothes twice (with white vinegar added in) to get the smell to a bearable level. Maybe my boyfriend poured in tons since other reviewers can't smell the product? Here's the boyfriends review. I do muay thai, jiu jitsu and judo twice a day 5 days a week. So you can imagine the status of my gis and hand wraps at the end of the week. They are all really thick so even the wet smell on them is annoying. This is the first product thats strong enough to overcome it. Now if ur gf is allergic to it maybe u shouldnt wash all your clothes in it, but otherwise its a good product that gets the job done."
4.00,"I came to Amazon hoping to purchase this product cheaper, and possibly put it on a subscribe and save, only to discover that even using the $2 coupon offered, it is still several dollars more expensive than walmart.  Our walmart offers the exact same weight product for $6.97 which I originally thought was kind of pricey, until I saw Amazon's price!                                                                     As far as the product goes, it really does add such a great fragrance to your laudnered clothes! My husband, who normally doesn't notice anything related to laundry mentioned it and said he likes it! He even said that since I started using it, his co-workers always say that they like the way his clothes smell and that he now has a smell that singles him out from everyone else.  They have even asked him to allow his wife to do their laundry! :D"
5.00,"I love this stuff. It is so easy to throw in the washer.  Scent is great  I would recommend to anyone."
5.00,"I just love this laundry booster...glad that downy came out with it..just what I needed to bring out that clean smell to my laundry and it lasts too."
5.00,"The scent is great in there little tiny pellets. I have used them before and really loved them, I am glad I bought them again. I love the extra refreshing scent they give my clothing, blankets and towels. I do however feel that the scent is not as prominent as when I had first tried them, and I am not the kind to skimp on the amount I throw in with my wash, so I doubt It's just me."
5.00,"The scent from this softener lasts so long! I pulled out some shirts that were washed and tucked away, and they still had a fresh scent to them. They are definitely worth the money."
2.00,"This applies to the lush scent. I may try the fresh scent after reading some glowing reviews.                                              I loved the scent of this, it was on sale &amp; I had a coupon. I'd read reviews about the scent being very strong so used in sparingly in the first load. Nothing. Tried it again and filled the entire cap, as I was doing a big load. Some items had a light pleasant fragrance, others none at all. It seemed that only the all cotton items carried the scent. However it would be far too expensive for me to use it regularly. And after a few hours, the scent is definitely fading. I folded a few t shirts to see if any scent remains in a week or two. It was fun to try it and I may use it on towels and sheets sometimes for a treat.                                              Update: A very mild scent after a week."
5.00,"My towels, sheets and clothes smell fantastic and fresh for weeks after using washing.   I have been using Downy Unstopables for over 6 months. I bought a new washer and dryer for a new home and thoight I would give my beuatiful new machines an extra perk. WOW! WOW! I have been hooked ever since. Admittedly, I do not use much at all. Because I have a new high efficient machine, I do not need much of any product. One bottle of Unstopables lasted about four months and I do about 6-8 large loads of laundry a week. I still use fabric softener and Tide with a touch of Downy and fabric softerner sheets in the dryer. I do not add liquid fabric softener to my laundry when washing towels. So, I have read a few other reviewers mention the additional high cost. It can be fairly negligible if you purchase this on sale and use wisely. The reward to your nose is worth it.   My scent of choice is the lavender (purple). It is a bit more subtle than the most popular blue labeled scent. I enjoy lavendar in many things around the house and use lavendar pillow sprays when I change the sheets to promote restful sleep. Your linen closets will smell wonderful, as will your drawers and traditional closets. This will give your workout clothes an extra perspiration anti-stink fighting boost because they already smell delicious. You will want to bury your face in your towels, pillows and even your kitchen towels, which I think can pick up odors quickly.   The only thing you may want to consider is guests or family members who are sensitive to fragrance and/or perfumes. I teach Yoga and other execise classes at my home. I love washing towels for my Yogi with Unstopables, but I always have a few towels available that have not been washed with extra perfumes.   Enjoy!!"
5.00,"I am a very scent oriented person.  I burn scented candles continually, buy my detergent based on the scent and so on.  When I purchased Downy Unstopables I expected it to do nothing for the quality or care of my laundry except add an extra scent boost and boy oh boy does it ever.  I absolutely love this product.  Sure the price isn't what I would like it to be (my grocery &amp; local stores have it much cheaper than here on Amazon) however I have found myself cutting back on the amount of fabric softener I use since purchasing Downy Unstopables.  When my wash is finished and I put my clothes in the dryer the smell is very strong.  Upon taking them out the scent is not as potent but very very reasonable in my opinion.  I travel alot for work and I find myself pulling items out of my closet last minute to pack and when I take them out of the suitcase or even pull them to wear after they've been there for awhile the scent still remains.  I come from a non-smoking home if that makes any difference.  Your clothes just smell so fresh &amp; clean when you use this product.  I have no hesitation in recommending this product to friends or family (which I have done several times).  Being a scent nut that I am, the price to me is worth it, mind you I am a single person and don't have to do the amount of laundry a family would.  I hope Downy keeps this product on the shelf.  I'd hate to do laundry without it."
5.00,"This is the most amazing laundry product I have purchased in a LONG time! I am a fanatic about clean smelling laundry; some soaps and dryer sheets just do not leave the long-lasting, fresh scent that I am looking for. This, though, does the trick! The best thing about it is that I can control how much or how little I put it. Throw a bunch in with towels and blankets and the smell lasts for weeks! The fresh scent one is amazing and I am eager to try the other scents!"
5.00,"This product is amazing. All my friends and neighbors are hooked on scentables! I love my bed smelling fresh and this product keeps my bed smelling just washed for a week."
5.00,"These little beads are amazing! The smell sticks to laundry like crazy & can last for a couple weeks hanging in your closets! Very satisfied! Highly recommend! Great for those stinky work clothes of men or kids mucky clothes!"
5.00,"Makes laundry smell clean & fresh"
5.00,"I love Downy unstopables they are great for clothes keep the scent and you can use them in wax warmers and make your house smell fantastic!"
5.00,"This product helps laundry smell so good for weeks to come. And, that is saying a lot when the men in your life perspire heavily."
5.00,"I absolutely adore this product. Detergent and softener impart a nice scent, but it usually fades after a day or so. Downy Unstopables give laundry an extra boost of freshness that really lasts. I especially appreciate it on jackets and coats that aren't necessarily washed as often as other items. It's also done very well on the throws in my living room, giving a sense of freshness in the room. The best is that you can determine how much of that fresh scent you want to add.                                                                     I'm a little weird in that I really do enjoy doing laundry, and this is one spectacular product!"
5.00,"This is a bit pricey comparing to other similar products that are double the size for same price or less but the scent is stronger. I think it's more concentrated. I prefer, and ordered the pink bottle, unfortunately Walmart sent me the \"golden\" one (different scent), but not worth exchanging. Scent is not too bad either in the one with the \"golden-beige\" cap. The pink one is more flowery and the scent is not too strong (as in the blue)."
5.00,"I really like downy unstopables, it always leaves my clothes smell so fresh, even after being stored away for the season. I also trust downy products. Thank-you downy, would you please make a larger size, and coupons that do not expire in one month. Thank- you DOWNY!"
5.00,"I just bought the purple one because I live in dorms, and recently after I washed my clothes here, everything just smelt funky and kinda mildew-ey to me.  I couldn't stand my own scent haha. So I decided that this stuff may be my solution.  I chose the purple because I felt the scent wasn't as overpowering as the blue.  It just smelt more subtle.  I'd describe the scent as fresh and warm.  It kind of reminds me of the smell of my shampoo, which I like.                                              So, I love this stuff!  It did exactly what I wanted it to do.  I only put about 1/3 a cup, because I'm usually not one to like really perfumey, strong smells.  This worked perfectly.  It's not too overpowering but I can still notice it.  I honestly can't stop smelling myself! haha, so yes, highly recommended. :)"
2.00,"Thought I would give this a try and frankly I couldn't notice a difference. I prefer just using the fabric softener. Just something else to spend your money on."
5.00,"This is the first product that ever made my husband's work clothes smell fresh. The freshness continues even through the dryer cycle. I am a true fan!"
5.00,"I gave this 5 stars because it does just what it says, fresh scent booster. You can adjust your level of fragrance which is outstanding. When folding clothes, it nice to have that extra freshness. If only clothes could fold themselves. Lol.. Overall Great Product!"
5.00,"This worked great in my high efficiency washer. It is pricey I think, and so it will be up to you whether it is a good value. I vote yes."
4.00,"Love the smell of our clothes when they come out of the dryer with these! This is definitely our favorite fragrance of the Unstoppable line! My only negative is that it's a little pricey for the amount of loads of laundry you get from one bottle."
5.00,"This is a must for any laundry. I use it while deployed here in afghanistan. Makes clothes smell 100 percent fresher than without."
4.00,"This was my first time using this type of product, but i was pretty impressed. The scent wasn't so strong that it burned my nose like other products."
5.00,"This product makes your load smell nice for weeks to a month at a time with only a little needed per wash."
5.00,"If your addicted to pleasant aromas you must try these magical little beads. I always had a hard time knowing when to add softener to my washing cycle. I love these because you put them in with the detergent. They truly do keep your laundry fresh smelling for at least 3 weeks!"
3.00,"I was hesitant, to say the least.  I like a little, mild scent on my laundry, but I don't want it to be overwhelming.  I use all natural detergent, which is all-but fragrance-free.  So I was hopeful that this product would provide a little scent.                                                                     When I sniffed inside the bottle, I knew it would be strong.  The directions state to use how much you want, and I only use a small amount.  1/2 tablespoon, at the most.  I just toss them into my front-load washer and then put the clothes in.  I've never had deposits from the scent booster wind up on my clothing, so I'm quite happy about that.  It seems to rinse away equally well in both hot and cold washes.  And, since the pellets are blue, I was hesitant about it leaving stains, but so far there are no stains.                                                                     I have found a couple of not fully disintegrated pellets inside of my washer here and there, but nothing significant.  Unless you use a large amount and do a lot of laundry, I don't think it will clog any part of your washer.                                                                     As for the scent, a little goes a LONG way.  My small amount I use makes my laundry have a light scent that lasts several days.  It's enough to smell fresh and clean without causing a scent overload.                                                                     The cap secures on well, but it still makes my laundry area smell like it.                                                                     I do like the fact that you can really control how much scent you want.  But I highly recommend starting small and working up."
5.00,"I just throw a small handful of these scented beads into my front loading HE washer after I put the clothes in. They all melt I guess, and leave the clothes smelling really fresh. I use less than the recommended capful and am very pleased with the results. My drawers (of the dresser and in the dresser) smell really good. And it is long lasting. I wear scrubs to work and someone commented on how good I smelled. Since we aren't allowed to wear cologne or smelly lotions at work, they were commenting on my freshly laundered scrubs! Also works wonders on my husbands stinky work socks. Good buy here on Amazon for about 4 bucks. I would never pay the 10+ dollars I have seen it for at the grocery store. Side note -- if you have a front load washer, be sure to check inside the rubber ring for stray beads."
5.00,"This stuff makes your clothes smell great! My wife usually puts less than the recommended amount and yet the clothes still come out smelling fresh and clean."
5.00,"They make all of my laundry smell great and the scent lasts for a long time. Towels and sheets coming out of the closet smell great. I recently handed down some children's clothes and my friend said her daughter loved the smell of them! Highly recommend."
1.00,"(note: Even if it had worked exceptionally well, the product is still extremely expensive)"
5.00,"These are less mess then the liquid and dont have to worry about them in the mail being damaged and leaking everywhere."
2.00,"I used the fresh scent in my towels. I was really impressed while it was washing. It made my whole house smell clean. However, it turned my towels blotchy blue in color. I have a HE washer that automatically does an extra rinse and I as well turned on another rinse since I am sometimes sensative to dyes and scents, so I know rinsing was NOT the issue. I would NOT recommend putting this in with clothes."
5.00,"I had originally got a sample in the mail for this item, and tried it out with my towels. The rest is history, the Fresh Scent really makes the bed sheets and towels smell great for a couple of days. Not sure about 7 days, but maybe for 4 days or so. Plus the fresh scent is not over-powering and has the right balance of scent. I would definitely recommend you try this out at least once, you may not turn back afterwards"
5.00,"We have tried all of the unstopables scents and they are all very nice, but this is our family's favorite. It's a nice, fresh scent and it lasts forever. It's so nice because our clothing and linens smell fantastic even after sitting in the closet or drawers for weeks. Although the scent is long lasting, it's not at all overpowering or annoying."
5.00,"I love the way this leaves my laundry smelling. I would use it more often, but it is a little pricey."
5.00,"I can only ever find this at Target, and am super excited that I didn't have to go to Target to get it, as the nearest Target is really far away. Thank you Amazon for carrying this amazing smelling product!"
3.00,"The product only rate 3 stars as it doesn't quite make it through wash, rinse and dry. Downey is noted for being first class, but my previous order fell short. Wish you luck in the future and hope your next formula meets your reeputation."
5.00,"My laundry has never smelled better. Love this product. Have put this on my subscribe and save items. I have an HE washer that doesn't always smell great. Now my laundry is better than ever and wait until you wash your sheets. OMG. Smells wonderful."
5.00,"I really love the smell of fresh laundry, and the smell of Downy. But many things, like towels and exercise clothes, are not supposed to be washed with fabric softener, because it leaves a waxy coating and plugs up the pores in the fabric, cutting down on absorbency and \"breathability\". I was hoping somebody would come up with something I could use to give these things a lasting clean smell without the softener. Downy Unstopables is exactly what I needed. I've only tried the Lush fragrance so far, but plan to use the others to test them out. I'll probably also use it in addition to softener on all our laundry, because it smells so good, and lasts longer than the fabric softener scent. Also great for sheets and to make the linen closet smell wonderful.                                                                     One thing to keep in mind is that a little goes a long way, so you may only need a sprinkle of the fragrance beads, and not a whole capful. You can go from just a hint of fragrance to a lot, or anywhere in between, depending on how much you use. I don't think I'd want to use a whole capful."
3.00,"After using this a few times in my wash, the smell is kind of like a medicine smell. It smelled good in the bottle but I do not care for it. Everybody has different tastes. I like the Purex brand smells better and they are cheaper. Both the Fresh and the Shimmer just smelled icky to me. I'm sticking with the Purex. It's cheaper, you get more and it smell MUCH better!"
5.00,"I was desperate to find something that would work on my teenagers football gear. NO matter how hot the water, how long the cycle I was never able to get the funky smell out of his gear. On a whim I picked these up and tried them on all the \"normal\" clothes from the rest of the family and it worked wonders. Next came the big test...a washer full of jerseys, socks, under shirts, and leggings. What a wonderful surprise it was to open the washer and do the smell test on these garments. Held my breath and waited for them to dry, no disappointment here either. The product is a little on the steep side, price wise, for our family of 6 but if it gets me through football season its well worth it."
5.00,"This stuff really works. We've been using them for a few months now. Towels really do come out of the closet several weeks later smelling good. I doubt the 5 month claim... but after 5 weeks, towels were still smelling good. Like I say, we keep buying this stuff now instead of using a fabric softener... as this stuff does keep it's scent for a long time."
5.00,"Downyhas always been my favorite scent for my laundry, but only wished the smell would last longer. This definately has made a difference. It has made my whole house smell fresher. My kids feel better about they way their clothes smell. Aparently they didn't smell as good as other kids??? Anyway, we are happy with the product and love getting it shipped to us regularly on our subscribe and save program. It costs me about 5.79 each that way."
5.00,"I love this product and would continue to purchase it at this price and deal. Great smelling clothes and continues to hold the freshness in my clothes and towels. My mother told me to try it and now I dont was without it. Try it you wont want to be without it! Sunshine"
5.00,"Go to Target. It's only $5.99 there! I just saw it there today!  It smells heavenly and you can put as much as you want before you load clothes in wash."
4.00,"If so, Downy Unstopables are for you :) This is not soap or fabric softener, it is like perfume for the laundry. I love the way it smells -- the scent is long lasting but not overpowering."
5.00,"Our clothes smell yummy! I like the gain fireworks and this is just as delightful. So glad I took a chance.."
5.00,"A little goes a long way...this is a great product...in addition t fabric softener, I use it for air freshener in my car. My daughter melts the pellets in a spray water bottle and makes her own Febreeze. I am going to do the same thing!"
5.00,"Laundry smells great. I only use enough to cover the bottom of the cup and my laundry smells great. Will buy again."
5.00,"We use this on all of our loads. They smell great for weeks after and when you open your drawer or closet you can smell the freshness."
2.00,"After hearing so much about this product, I decided to go ahead and give it a try. Who doesn't love to smell the fresh scent of laundry long after the clothes have been washed? Well, I wasn't thrilled with the directions (to use as little or as much as you want). I like being told what works and what doesn't. Otherwise, I'm worried I'll overdo it and waste the product or underdo and waste the product. Well, I tried several different loads of laundry with several different amounts of product in the cup and, while they all have a nice scent, I'm not really sure it smells any better than other products I've used.                                              I felt like this was a bit of a waste of money for me when my other products (Gain especially) do the exact same thing. I'm usually fairly easily amused, but I also really like not wasting money on products that aren't necessary in addition to what you already use."
5.00,"This product is awesome! It leaves the perfecr smell on your clothes without damaging stains. Scent lasts a long time too."
1.00,"I got the bright idea to try this new product. I had a terrible allergic reaction that took me two weeks to figure out that it was from the Downy Unstopables. So I had re-wash all my clothes again, and I have had no problems since. So if you find yourself breaking out in welts that are very red and itchy and your using the Downy stop right away."
5.00,"Finally my uniforms and clothes here in Afghanistan smell like home... I really enjoy my clothes no after the laundry..."
4.00,"I always wondered how some peoples clothes smelled so good . well until i started using the unstopables my fabrics were just plane . now i enjoy having the nice smell of clean laundry ."
5.00,"Love the ease of use - no messy liquids. Has a long lasting fresh scent tat stays on even after the dryer."
5.00,"Used it with my sons football wear and it helps so much. Nothing will get the smell out of his jersey since its old and been worn by how many kids, but this with Tide Active really helps a ton!! Its so easy to just put in the wash and right away you smell how nice it is. Not to overpowering either once the wash is done."
4.00,"These are a nice fragrance but pricey for the amount of laundry I do. I can always just add an additional cap of fabric softener and get the same result. Nice for the clothes to smell nice before the fabric softener cycle but with our water the smell isn't overly noticed after going through the dryer."
3.00,"It smells great when starting in the washer. And it is disappeared after pulling out from the dryer. I compared two loads; one with it and one without, it does not make any difference. It’s not a bad product sine it works for some people but I think it’s a waste of money."
2.00,"Although it bears the Downy name, this product is not a fabric softener, it is simply a \"scent booster\". Not worth the cost just for the scent, in my opinion."
5.00,"Works great especially when combined with the Downy Infusions. My daughter's dance outfits have never smelled better."
5.00,"I used this recently when I washed my blankets and towels, and I was definitely impressed.  Just a small amount (half a capful) was necessary to give my blankets and towels an extra burst of freshness.  The scent is a little bit floral and lasts for a few days.  I put the Downy booster directly into the washer. (Instructions say NOT to put in your dispenser) And it does work fine with high efficiency washers.  I do recommend this for times when you may want extra freshness for your clothes or towels."
5.00,"Tried different scents and just love the way it makes my clothes smell You use it along with your Landry detergent-Wow it really makes clothes smell so good Amber087"
4.00,"The smell could be better, I expected it to be much nicer scent, but when I wash a load with it I will see if it smells better."
4.00,"I live and work in a war-zone. The laundry service here sucks because once it is retuned to me, it has no sent... so adding these sent boosters makes the whole difference. I love it and now tha i have shared \" my little secret\" to my colleagues they will buy some too! I also put some in the cap, and put it in my waredrobe closet, oh it smells great now! :)"
5.00,"I was using the other one, green bottle that the unstopables come in, for about 2 months, and although I enjoy the scent, it was a little too perfume smelling and both of us was not a real fan of it. So I tried this one, purchased through Amazon using the Subscribe &amp; Save program (which is cheaper where I live to do it this way, and I'm factoring gas, time and product cost at T.!) and I'm very pleased. The scent stays in the cloths, even though a workout (that I was surprised about!) and well I'm a fan."
5.00,"Wonderful fragrance NOT too strong but leaves a fresh after scent on all our clothes & towels! I will always buy this stuff!"
5.00,"The scent is wonderful and lingers for at least two weeks"
5.00,"This product leaves my laundry smelling amazing. You pour the little beads into the washer with your detergent and they dissolve leaving a very fresh laundry scent. I use a little more than called for because I found the scent to be a little weaker than I liked with just the capful. The product does not leave any kind of residue on the fabrics taht I could notice. HIGHLY RECOMMEND if you like fresh smelling laundry and if you aren't allergic to scented laundry products. I would not have used this when my children were smaller because they had terribel excema and needed to use scent free products."
5.00,"I fell in love with this product when I used the free sample I got a few weeks ago. I had seen this product on Facenook and was wondering, \"Why is this product such a big deal?!\" When I used the sample at the laundry mat, It's scent filled the air. I instantly was in love. The scent even lasted till the next time I washed my clothes. I'M HOOKED! This product is the real deal and I think its worth every penny because it lasts a long time if you don't over do it. Thank you Downy for this wonderful invention!"
5.00,"I love all the Unstopables...its all I want for Christmas!!!! Actually, my whole family is hooked on these darn things...great stocking stuffers!!"
5.00,"I love these things. And it always a good thing when you can find an online coupon! They are quite expensive in stores."
5.00,"My clothes are fresher when I use this product. This is a very good product and I will be using it for a very long time."
5.00,"Throw out your fabric softner, this is the best stuff ever. and the fragrance lasts and lasts. Only need very little"
5.00,"I buy a few canisters and pour them into a neat lidded glass jar in my laundry room. When I'm in there folding laundry, I open the lid just to get the clean fresh scent in the room. OH, I also use it in my laundry, ha ha."
5.00,"This works great with home made laundry detergent. My only complaint is that I wish the price point was lower."
5.00,"I tried these by accident and wow was I thrilled with the scent which lasts. I can't imagine doing laundry now without these."
4.00,"It works the way it should, it makes your clothes smell awesome! Some friends of mine that smoke in their house use it and they don't even smell bad when they leave their house. For them, a bottle would only last about 4 loads. For me, about twice that. The only problem is it is a little pricey for 8-loads-worth of washes. Couponing would help."
2.00,"It cleans well but I find the scent doesn't last long and it doesn't smell the same as the regular unstopables scent."
4.00,"This product works well to remove or cover (not sure how it works) lingering  odors in the laundry.  This works well for laundry when our  12 year old, occasionally incontinent, dog  suffers a bout of leaking."
3.00,"I got a sample pack of these as a freebie not very long ago, I finally decided to use them today. First, I don't have my own washer, I live in an apartment like complex and have to resort to using their washers. They smell fabulous, they made the whole laundry room smell really good, a fellow neighbor even asked what I was using, so no problems there. What I did have a problem with is that they had not dissolved whatsoever during the wash, leaving little globs of glue like stuff all over my clothes, I had to end up picking each individual one off and hoping the dryer would melt any remainders and NOT stain or ruin my clothes. Now I can't attest that this is a problem with the product itself, or the crappy 80s era washing machine my complex has. The smell also lasted, and was pretty strong, BUT being a lady it would clash with any perfume or body sprays I would use, but I think they'd be really nice to use with towels and blankets. I'd say this product is definitely worth a try, but not if you have a crappy washer!"
3.00,"I had good results with this product, but I found that I received the same amount of fresh scent with this product as I usually do with my fabric softener. Next time I may add a little more to the wash and see if there's any difference, but overall, Unstoppables is nice for an extra scent boost. I don't know if I'd purchase it in the future, but it was nice to try."
5.00,"We love Unstopables in our household. We use them on our sheets and towels, which keep a great scent! Extremely satisfied."
1.00,"I got this mainly to use with sheets, towels, and my workout clothes. once home, I opened it and sniffed- not much of a scent, but I figured maybe it was released in the water. Washed the first load using about half a cap full of the product. I barely noticed the scent when I opened the washer at the end of the cycle. Once the sheets were dry...nothing. Tried it again, this time using a whole cap full of the pink pellets. Same thing again. No scent on the towels, at all! It's not just me- my husband can't smell it, either. This is a waste of money. I won't be buying this again and I'll certainly be wary of Downy products."
4.00,"I love this scent! Makes the clothes smell good for months. It doesn't last long though. It can easily be gone in about five loads."
5.00,"These are my new favorite, they make your clothes smell so good! If you haven't tried them you should, they are great!"
5.00,"My sister asked for these for Christmas, I purchased every scent Walmart offered, she loves them and says its the best scent for wash! Personally, I have not tried them but I shopped around, Walmart had the best price, most scents and free shipping which meant no use of time in a car and gas."
5.00,"Made clothes smell fresh and clean. Easy to use. Great product overall. I will use this again and again. I give this an A+++"
2.00,"When I first tried this product on my sheets I LOVED LOVED LOVED it!! My entire bedroom smelled AWSOME! The second time it was ok too on my towels, but thereafter the scent all but vanished. I use an HE front loader washer and at this point I really smell nothing different in my clothes/sheets even if I were to dump half the bottle in there! WHY? Is there some buildup going on in there that doesn't give me that awesome scent anymore? Now I just smell it very faintly but believe me it is NOTHING like it was at first. Anyone know why? I'd really LOVE to get that scent back. I've tried cleaning my machine as well numerous times with no change, I still can't hardly smell it anymore. The two stars is only because it was GREAT for the first couple washes, but I won't spend that kind of money anymore since it doesn't work for me anymore."
5.00,"I love Unstoppables because I (sometimes) have a bad habit of leaving laundry in the washing machine overnight almost always resulting in a musty smell and having to wash them again. Unstoppables eliminates the need to rewash! Keep in mind, this is NOT a fabric softener. It is just as it says \"in-wash scent booster\" and you should still use fabric softener when using Unstoppables. I do not like the regular price of this product in stores, but when purchased using coupons, it lessens the pain a little. I recently stocked up (bought 8 jars) at a wholesale club using their store coupon as well as manufacturing coupons and only paid about $3 a bottle. PS Due to how expensive this stuff is, I do NOT fill the entire cup. I usually go about 1/2 way (even less if it's my kid's clothes) and still get great results. I also use a little less fabric softener too now. (I used to always fill the cap all the way to the top just to get a stronger scent)."
5.00,"Best smelling out of the 3 scents offered by Downy. Does what it says it's supposed to do. Will buy again"
4.00,"This scent takes a little getting used to. If anyone is like me and is trying to decide how big 50oz is, it's the tiny one!! I overpaid bigtime after shipping charges! I should have just gone to KMart! And I will in the future."
5.00,"If you enjoy aromatherapy and smelling like incense, this product will do you well. Somehow this product penetrates the clothing fibers and leaves clothes smelling fresh and clean. I do my laundry in the damp basement, and sometimes the clean clothes can have a slight must scent despite my best efforts. I have had nothing but fresh smelling laundry since I started using this product. It does exactly what it claims, and it does it well."
4.00,"I make my own laundry detergent which has no scent. I missed that \"clean laundry smell\" that permeates the house when I'd do the piles of laundry. This particular scent, \"Fresh Scent\" is refreshing! It keeps the clothes smelling good for a few days and gives the closet or drawer of clothes some freshening too. Just be sure to not use too much as it will overwhelm when you want to wear perfume/cologne. The directions are sketchy when it comes to top-load HE washers. Put it in before the clothes? After the clothes are loaded? I've tried both and it seems to make no difference but I feel more comfortable putting the booster in last thing as my washer pumps all the left over water out of the tubs before starting the wash cycle.Does it make a difference, probably not LOL."
5.00,"Used as directed, these little pellets make your clothes smell better. To me the scent is a little overpowering at first (that happens with any laundry product for my nose) but when the clothes are done washing it's not too strong. At first I thought that this was just another fabric softener but you actually add it in the wash cycle as the title implies. I like this scent although I actually prefer the purple scent called Lush that smells like lavender. I got that one at Wal-Mart and I'm not sure how much I paid but it was most likely less than what is being charged here. At a cheaper price you should definitely try this and the other scent."
5.00,"I use these EVERY time I do laundry. It makes my clothes smell wonderful. Will be using this brand a LONG time."
5.00,"Front load washer necessities! Keeps the gross smell out of my front load washer and keeps my clothes fresh and clean smelling!"
3.00,"I was really anxious to try these because I love the smell of regular Downy and was excited about a product that would keep my clothes smelling that way longer.  Unfortunately both of the scents that the Unstopables comes in currently are different smelling than original Downy.  I tried the wash fresh scent.  It's clean smelling and fresh, but it's a bit too strong for me.  I used about a half of a cap the first time and about a quarter cap the second and both loads were a bit too strong smelling for me.  If they had this in the original Downy scent, I'd be thrilled, because the scent really does last and stays on your clothes well after they are laundered."
5.00,"I have been making my own laundry detergent for a few months now and it is wonderful!  My clothes have never been cleaner, my towels never as fluffy, not to mention how much money it saves.  However,  it has absolutely no scent.  Personally it doesn't bother me, but my husband missed the \"clean \" smell.  These pellets solved the problem nicely.  Just a bit sprinkled in the washer with the detergent added the touch of scent he was missing.  I use WAY less than recommended - We just wanted a hint of fragrance, not to be knocked out by it.  I would say a small palmful for a large load.  The price here on Amazon is comparible to the grocery store but with free Prime shipping it comes right to my door.  The crystals are not fabric softener, but my clothes come out fine without a softener anyway."
1.00,"Let me start off by saying, I really wanted to love this product. I used it first on my sheets, comforter and towels. The smell is heavenly! Unfortunately, I developed such a bad rash almost instantly, that I had to see a doctor. Itchy, red, blotchy, mess. My skin just does NOT like this product. Very sad. Not sure what they put in it that caused me to have such a bad reaction, but if you are the type to be sensitive to perfumes, dyes and fragrance even in the slightest bit, do NOT use this product. I repeat, do not use this product."
4.00,"If you can find a coupon for this product or find it on sale, it's worth buying.  The scent lasts a long time and even infuses dresser drawers and closets with the same pleasant smell.  It also does a good job of removing the \"stale\" scent that occurs from time to time in HE washing machines without resorting to a waste of a hot water cycle using bleach or vinegar.                                                                     That said, the price is the only thing that keeps me from buying it on a regular basis.  It costs a little over three times as much as Purex laundry enhancer crystals.  Granted, Downey's scent is stronger at least initially, but I find the length of time the scent remains and the amount of product used per load are exactly the same. It's no wonder Purex crystals are often sold out but there are lots of bottles of Unstopables still on the shelves.  Downy would probably have more of a hit on their hands if they'd lower their price a bit.                                                                     5 stars for the quality of the product and truth in advertising for performing exactly as the description says, -1 star for price."
5.00,"I wash in cold water to try and save energy but the down side is my clothes don't smell fresh. I can't blame my machine, it's trying to compete with a husband who is a 7 day a week certified gym rat (who looks AMAZING by the way) and 3 loveable but smelly dogs who think our bed is theirs. What washer could compete with all that smelliness? So, I started using Downy unstoppables and now the clothes smell fresh and clean again. I like all the scents but this one is my favorite. It reminds me of flowers however the scent isn't so overpowering that my husband complains his clothes smell like \"perfume\"."
3.00,"Love the scent of this product.  Unfortunately, you do have to add more for a stronger scent, therefore not lasting very long.  To me, not worth it for the price."
5.00,"Love this product and I dont need add a ton to my laundry load."
5.00,"I am addicted to this product. My 8 year old actually commented on how yummy her clothes smell ! I have yet to find a better price even on sale and with free shipping it is a no brainer."
1.00,"The 170 load bottle with the spout is less than $30 at the grocery store! Even if you do subscribe and save you're still spending $40.75 for only 144 loads. Go to ANY grocery store and just buy the giant bottle, it will save you a lot of money! :)"
5.00,"I cannot live without this product. It makes your clothes smell great. I wish they could include the fabric softner in with this."
3.00,"I was very excited about trying this because I like a crystal or non-liquid idea of fabric softener, however it is VERY expensive and you must use a lot to get a fresh smell result. Although Purex crystals aren't wonderful either at least they are reasonably priced. I'll stick with them until someone comes up with something that works and doesn't cost so much."
5.00,"Smells good, which is a personal opinion, of course. You may not love the scent. I use it in the loads where I don't want to use softener, like the dog blankets and towels, etc. The scent lasts, and you can use more or less in a load of laundry depending on your preferences."
5.00,"I consider this product a luxury, because it is expensive if you use it frequently, and let's face it, you don't need it. But I love it on sheets and towels. I would use it more often if it weren't so pricey (or I could use a coupon more than once in a lifetime)."
5.00,"not overppowering just right! easy to use and the pour top is nice.bottle is easy to hadle with smaller in middle of bottle."
5.00,"They smell great and they last and last. Couldn't believe how few it takes for a long lasting smell. We will reorder when we run out."
1.00,"This product made me break out into hives. Can't use it I think my husband brought on sale. Never again"
4.00,"I started out using this on blue jeans, towels, bed linens, and sweatshirts (things that I may use more than once or twice and want to always smell good). Obviously the scent fades over time, but I enjoyed it so much that I decided to use it with all of my laundry. The price point is a little high, so if you're someone who has a lot of of laundry (I don't), then I would recommend saving it for those special loads like I mentioned at the beginning."
5.00,"This blue one is the best! Wonderfully fresh fragrance! Pink one is okay for cute chicks cloths, smells sweet. Don't recommend purple one, smells like a dying grandpa."
5.00,"So if you've seen the TV ads, you probably understand that these 'crystals' are dry.  You put them into the washer when you begin the was cycle - with your detergent.  I was skeptical - I've been the victim of Downey's many 'new scent' campaigns... which were largely a disappointment.  I always came back to the classic product.                                              There is good news with this one!  This is actually more convenient (to use in the wash cycle) than regular Downey (which I had to use only in the rinse cycle)and it does NOT discolor clothes like the 'concentrated' Downey can do to whites.                                              Hooray!  Finally a better product.                                              Yes, even though you put these in the was cycle, clothes come out smelling good and static free.  I absolutely love the tight seal cap that snaps open and closed to keep the small pills in the container in case the tall plastic canister tips over.  I've used it now for several different loads and have had nothing but positive results.  I recommend it."
5.00,"I got this to use with my clothes and I like the results and comets I get.  I will use this again"
5.00,"Smells great and lasts a long time. Is it necessary? Probably not. But it does smell nice and I get compliments sometimes that my clothes/sheets smell really good."
2.00,"I like my laundry to smell nice and the scent lasts as towels and sheets are put back in the closet."
5.00,"I use these in every load of laundry! They have a long lasting scent and are much better than the generic ones. I do think they are a bit expensive but again, they are much better than other, less expensive brands I have tried."
5.00,"These are great to use when washing gym clothes, sheets, and towels. They smell fresh when I put them on the bed like they just came out of the dryer when it has been weeks since they were put in the closet!"
5.00,"I absolutely love how this makes your laundry smell fresh. When I wash my blankets, my kids just want to wrap themselves in them so they can keep smelling it. Love it!"
5.00,"I have tried different scent boosters available from different brands in order to make my laundry smell clean and fresh for days after washing. I had received a free sample of Unstopables in the mail when they first came out, and I loved the scent but forgot the brand so I kept trying different ones. I had tried different crystals (some straight-up made me nauseous), liquid detergents, and fabric softeners to get that wonderful fresh scent of clean laundry, but the Downy Unstopables were the scent I fell in love with. I have put these on the Subscribe-and-Save since I kept purchasing them, and there is no sense in ever running out! I use about 1/3 of the cap full in a large load of laundry, and the scent is absolutely wonderful. I have tried all the different scents and the Fresh Scent is the absolute best to me. The Lush Scent reminds me of my grandmother's house, while the Shimmer reminds me of bubblegum and crazy lip gloss that 14 year-old girls wear. The nice thing about the Fresh Scent is that it's like a spring day mixed with fresh cotton, very warm and home-like. I'm sure this may sound strange, but I even use these in my car as an air freshener. Like many others, I have those socks that never seem to have a mate, so I took one of them and put about a capful of Unstopables in the sock, and then used my wife's sewing machine and closed up the other end. When the prep-work was complete, I threw the sock under my driver's seat and the scent works wonders in my car."
5.00,"The TV ads on this one are true.  The pleasant scent goes on and on.  After a week my sheets still smell wonderful."
5.00,"As long as my clothes don't stink I'm pretty happy, but my wife has become obsessed with the smell of clean laundry. I was able to pick this up as an add-on item with coupons for a ridiculously good price (thank you slickdeals)."
5.00,"This is by far the Best Scent Boosters, the smells lasts until you wash again( just like in the commercial) and it smells GREAT! LOVE LOVE LOVE would never change! if you haven't gotten this you have to get it!"
1.00,"This does not work for me. It has barely any scent. My clothes do not smell any stronger than just with Downy fabric softener. Smells good but is very faint when you open the container but no matter how much I add to the load, barely any scent is there when the load is over. It is as if it just goes down the drain. I even tested this in a cup full of water to see if the water would activate it. I tried both hot and cold water. It took forever for the product to melt even in hot water so I think they are just washing down the drain in the rinse cycle without releasing the scent."
5.00,"I'm in college, and we have over 500 people using the same six wash machines, and well they're high efficiency and they don't get cleaned like they should and therefore no matter how much detergent you use, your laundry still stinks. Instead of trekking 4 hours back home every weekend to do my laundry in a washing machine that does not smell like mold, I just stick the downy in there and bam! my laundry smells great. They're a little on the pricey side, but it's better than going around with clothes that smell like socks. The knock off version by gain does not work as well. the scent for these lasts for weeks, depending on where you keep your clothes. They don't clog your HE washer's filter. they're wonderful."
4.00,"I had a horrible problem with the sulfur smell in the black jeans my daughter got for school this year.  We tried everything: vinegar, borax, fels-naptha, soaking again and again.  The smell would not come out!  I received a sample of Downy Unstopables in the mail and tried it on the black jeans.  They smell great!  All of the sulfur odor is gone (or at least masked).  We're on the second wash since adding the Unstopables and they still smell great.  It's a little too pricey for everyday use, but if you have something that's really stinky, this works well!  Five stars if the price comes down."
5.00,"I wasn't so sure about this at first now I can't get enough of it. I was worried that they wouldn't dissolve they do and the smell is wonderful."
1.00,"They don't last that long, these are much cheaper in the grocery stores. I will not purchase these again. They don't work"
4.00,"I REALLY LIKE THE UNSTOPABLES AS THEY DO LEAVE YOUR LAUNDRY SMELLING GREAT.  DON'T THINK SCENT LASTS AS LONG AS THEY SAY, OR MAYBE I JUST BECOME USED TO IT QUICKLY."
5.00,"Only buy these if you plan on becomming addicted. I seriously smell myself all day after I have been using these, and they should use me as a promo girl because I run around telling people to smell my clothes and then promote the product. I am in love with this. It makes folding laundry an olfactory delight. Also I put some (in a pair of super thin dress socks) in my car (Pinterest tip) and it smells AMAZING. And some in my closet, AMAZING. Towels, sheets, clothes, EVERYTHING. I wish I could sprinkle these around the perimeter of my apartment. My only worry is that there must be a ton of chemicals in these to make them smell so good for so long, so I choose to stay ignorant on that for now but eventually may taper down the use."
5.00,"I just love this new product. I have now tried all of the different sents and this is my very favorite."
5.00,"I love my laundry to smell extremely well. A refreshing scent and not a perfume smell. It's reasonably priced. It gets my recommendation."
5.00,"I'm not one for scented laundry but these Downy Unstopables are great. I sprinkle in just a little and everything smells wonderful. No need to use a lot...so the bottle lasts for a while!"
5.00,"\"Lush\" is my favorite laundry smell ever! After I wash sheets with this added in, I can still smell it after they have been sitting in the closet for months. With my clothes, I get whiffs of this randomly during the day. Like this \"Lush\" scent much better than the \"Fresh Scent.\""
5.00,"When the box first arrived in the mail I of course opened with glee because first off I love Downy and second...did I mention I love Downy.I being the \"follow the rules kind of gal that I am\"... {cough} read through the instructions.*How to Use: Downy UnStopables go directly into the washer drum to infuse a fresh unstoppable scent.Shake a little or a lot into the cap.Toss into the drum of HE or regular washer before you start the wash.Drop in any machine-washable cloths, towels and other fabrics.Enjoy lasting fresh scent.**DO NOT PUT INTO YOUR LIQUID DISPENSER OR DRYER.Use with or without fabric softener.Ok directions read and understood...check!I immediately use in my next two loads of laundry. Jeans and then towels.Upon removing the jeans from the wash they were a bit over powering in scent because my fabric softener is scented as well.My towels smelled SO good. I do not add fabric softener to my bath towels (so they are more absorbent).The best thing happened when I pulled a towel out of the bath cabinet almost 2 week's later. They still smelled fresh and not that stale \"I've been in this cabinet way too long\" kind of scent. A fresh \"I was just brought in from the laundry scent\"! I loved it!I have made the choice to continue using the Downy UnStopables for my towels and sheets. Oh you really have to try this on your bed sheets. I wash mine weekly and they still smell great although dirty at the end of the week.You can find Downy UnStopables in the laundry aisle in your supermarket. With two choices of scents.Fresh - Clean, Airy, CrispLush - Luxurious, Relaxing, Romantic"
5.00,"I was kind of skeptical at first, but I received a sample in the mail and tried it and loved it! Now it's becoming a part of doing our laundry every day, between two kids and a husband I definitely needed this freshness added."
5.00,"I have used Tide for years! Just would not use anything else. I like being able to order it from Amazon in quantities and have it delivered to my house and I get it at a better price!! I like that. I will probably continue to order it from Amazon!!"
3.00,"I am a military member deployed overseas and I brought this to give my undergarments a \"boost\" as advertised. My clothing did get a boost after the inital wash but the boost didn't last very long, maybe a couple days at most."
5.00,"love it makes my clothes smell so fresh no more sheets"
5.00,"LOVE this!! The scent is absolutely my favorite! I got the one in the blue top, I think it's the clean scent. I will definitely buy again!"
2.00,"my clothes didn't smell any different no matter how much i used. a few years back they had a much better product that lasted on clothes for a long time. I'll just stick to detergent."
3.00,"I love that my laundry always smells fresh and clean, however this product is too expensive. I can get more bang for my buck buying the regular Downy FS at Costco."
3.00,"I use a front load washer and I had to remember to put these in first or they would fall out if laundry was already in. I use downy fabric softener and I couldn't really tell a difference of using this or the softener. I will stick to fabric softener."
5.00,"Great long-lasting scent! I use this for my sheets. It doesn't require much for a load to make a difference."
1.00,"Tried using this product with Tide liquid detergent and could not smell any \"boost\" when I pulled my clothes out of the washer and same result after they came out of the dryer. Maybe if I dumped the whole bottle in....??? If I want a scent boost I will just buy Gain powder detergent. The only possible use I could see for this is adding some to home-made detergent....but that's a big maybe."
3.00,"If you already use scented laundry detergent or fabric softener, there is no real value in using Downy's Scent Booster.  The product does work. You pour up to a lid-full of the tiny scent booster granules directly into your wash machine before adding the clothes.  The strong-scented granules dissolve in the water and the scent permeates your clothing. It doesn't smell bad, I am just not sure the advantage of using this product over purchasing a scented laundry detergent or fabric softener, unless you have an issue with really, really stinky clothes."
5.00,"I was really excited to try this product. I read the instructions and realized I would have to experiment with the amount that I used the first time. I washed towels and just covered the bottom of the cup. Perfect. The smell is amazing and my bathroom smells wonderful.                                                                     I used my usual detergent and did not use any kind of fabric softener in the dryer. Didn't need to. Next I washed my sheets using a little bit less. Worked out very well.                                                                     The cost is expensive, but you don't have to use very much. I will purchase when this is gone. Love it."
2.00,"Nice spell and worked good but it did not last as long as advertised. Expensive for the amount of product you get."
4.00,"I could stand for the scent to be a bit stronger, but these make my laundry smell a goo bit fresher, longer."
5.00,"I would use this product sparingly paying close attention to how large your loads are for optimal results. Nice scent!"
5.00,"These are the best! I have found that they work great for towels and sheets, the fragrance stays for a little while. Make sure to put the beads in the water prior to the laundry so the beads can dissolve. I would recommend this product."
5.00,"This product is a scent booster. It doesn't do anything in the way of cleaning or softening, but in the way of fresh scent it dominates.                                                                     I first came to this realization when I opened the towel closet and the fresh scent washed over me like a wave. I took my towel into the bathroom with me and used it after a shower. What an amazing fresh scent. It may be an unnecessary luxury item, and one I probably couldn't afford if not for the Vine Program, but how nice to slip in a shirt and relive the freshness every morning.                                                                     If fresh scent is a priority, this Downy product could do no more to please you."
5.00,"Great addition to a load of laundry to give it a great scent. A little goes a long way. I've had one bottle for over three months. 20 grains or so is all it takes!"
3.00,"I bought this product based on the high reviews and because I really needed to try something of this nature. My husband is a marine and his uniform that he wears every day to work comes home dirty pretty much every single day. About a week ago I washed it on the heavy cycle, with extra rinse, tide detergent, and fabric softener... TWICE, and then used two dryer sheets in the dryer... and it still came out smelling like dirt. We just purchased a brand new washer and dyer so I've been experimenting with a lot of different products to see which work the best. So, I hit the store, determined that I was going to fix this \"unfixable\" situation and make his uniform smell nice. I purchased the tide \"febreze sport\" detergent instead of just the regular tide. And I tried this product- the downy \"unstopables\". I added an entire cap full into the bottom of my washing machine along with my new detergent and my fabric softener. Then threw it into the dryer, again, with two dryer sheets. And.... disappointment. They came out with a very, very faint nice smell. And a couple of HOURS later? Completely gone. This was before he had even put it on. And of course.. when my husband came home from work the same day- smelly clothes. Now, I do have to say this isn't a normal case. Asking to get these smelling nice is like expecting a miracle- and I understand that. I just thought maybe, maybe this would be that miracle. I washed a load of towels next with the same amount of unstopables and they did smell stronger, but actually not by a lot- not a lot more than they normally smell. I did give it a couple of stars because of the way my towels smelled- but to me it isn't worth the money. I'm glad other people are having such success with it- and like I said my demands were a little high."
5.00,"I don't use softener, so this is just what I've been looking for for years! I wrestle human alligators for a living, and my clothes now smell good even after a day of slobber (theirs) and sweat (mine). LOVE it!!"
1.00,"I've been using the normal green one for many months now and have raved about it.                                                                     However, I just switched to lush and got skin rashes in areas where clothing contacted my skin and hives from sleeping in bedding that were washed in it. I did a bit of research and found that I was not the only one getting allergic reactions to this product. (I have no other allergies that I know of)                                                                     Needless to say I threw away the bottle of lush but may switch back to the other scent if I'm feeling daring (or stupid)."
4.00,"This really does keep its scent for months and I use very little in each load. I'm only giving it 4 stars because I'm a little concerned about what it is made of that it smells so long. I'm truly a little scared to use it on anything other than towels and bedspreads. I think anything else and it would really bother my allergies because it is so strong."
5.00,"I like this new laundry fragrance. It's very easy to use, you simply add it at the beginning of your wash and your laundry will come out smelling great. The \"Fresh\" scent is exactly that a very clean and fresh fragrance which I find pleasant. The scent seems to last quite a long time I could still smell it on my clothes after working a full day in them. I only wish this scent booster would double as a laundry softener but for that you will have to buy a different product."
3.00,"The smell is very strong, so I only use this on my sheets and towels, but I don't think this would be something to use with regular clothes."
5.00,"i really love the way these make my laundry smell.my laundry smells fantastic and stays that way for days.even keeps my dirty laundry from smelling bad"
2.00,"I really want to enjoy these scent boosters, but every time I use it, my clothes come out with stains. I have a top load HE washer. I cannot have the washer start, have water in it then add my clothes to it so that option is out. I thought maybe because I used cold water, the beads weren't properly dissolving and were staining my clothes, so I tried it in hot water and nothing changed. I am going to try it one more time by dissolving the beads in water in the microwave and adding it to my laundry before I start my wash. Does anyone have any suggestions on how you have successfully used this product without staining your clothes?"
5.00,"Heres a little tip. Mix a small amount of these in water and place in a spray bottle. You have febreeze at a way cheaper price!"
5.00,"I'll admit - I was skeptical about this product.  I mean I already use Tide w/Downy and Downy fabric softner - why would I need these?  Well - technically I don't since Tide and Downy clean and soften my clothes but even those products don't give me the long lasting fresh smell.  As a pet owner - 1 dog, 3 ferrets and 3 birds - this product is wonderful for me.  Even after playing with my animals for hours, my clothes don't smell like them - I don't have to change my shirt before going out in public.  And true story - one day at the store I work in, I asked a customer if they used Downy because they smelled good.  She said \"No -it's not me - it's you\"  Sure enough I sniffed my sweater sleeve and said \"Mmmmmm - it is me\"  She then asked me what I used and I told her. That compliment is much better than hearing you smell like wet dog or stinky ferrets. LOL"
5.00,"Downy Unstoppables is my new staple when it comes to doing laundry. These things are absolutely amazing!!! They keep my clothes, towels, and sheets smelling so fresh for weeks!! There has been a few times where I forgot to throw the laundry in the dryer and then it gets that musty smell and then you have to re-wash the whole load. I have been using these unstoppable for a couple months now, and the other week I had forgot to switch the laundry into the dryer (oops!) and to my surprise there was no musty smell what so ever! They still smelled so fresh! However, they are pretty expensive and you are supposed to use a capful for each load. In order to save a little money I usually fill the cap only half full. This makes the container last a little longer since I have to put them in every load that I wash now. I love that they keep coming out with new scents as well. My new favorite is the Shimmer!! Smells so delicious!!! Even though these are expensive, they are well worth the extra money! I would definitely recommend everyone to try these at least once."
5.00,"I have to admit that I wondered what I was thinking after I ordered this. I have a fabric softener and even the downy sheets that add plenty of scent. I just knew that this was going to be a disaster - like dumping perfume in the washer. What a surprise. It is a well-blended light scent that smells fresh when you open the washer but not overpowering. Then it goes through the drying and retains this very fresh scent instead of the slightly stale scent normally found in even freshly-washed clothing. Let's face it: most of our water does not smell that great when you hold it up to your nose and fabric softeners seem to just mask with perfume. This booster is definitely different. Two weeks later I can pull my blouse out of the closet and it does not smell like perfume; but it does smell fresh and lightly scented when I hold it up to my nose. A winner"
5.00,"Love this scent. Not a fan of the other scents but this one I love. I use this along with the honey blossom liquid softener and my clothes bed linen, towels smell fresh for weeks. People at work even notice."
5.00,"I do like it. I had never smell my clothes like that before. Thank you very much.                           Regards              Saeed                           &quot;Can you send me a free one :D&quot;"
4.00,"Leave sheets with a nice scent.....this product is not over bearing."
5.00,"I use these in my laundry and throw a few in my my rainbow air freshener so the whole house can smell like laundry day. I know it's just an additive and isn't really necessary, but I just love the smell."
5.00,"I love the smell of these so much will be it getting it regularly everyone comments like nothing I've bought before it amazing"
5.00,"Smells great - I have the FRESH scent. I use less than half a capful because the smell is so potent. I use it on bedding mostly, and my couch cover - not on my regular clothes because I also use body sprays and don't want too many scents going all at once."
5.00,"SMELLS GREAT--AND MAKES THE CLOTHES SMELL REALLY, REALLY GOOD. I WILL CONTINUE TO BUY THIS PRODUCT IN THE FUTURE BECAUSE IT REALLY SEEMS TO GIVE OFF A NICE SMELL TO THE CLOTHES."
5.00,"This is a nice addition to my laundry room. I make my own laundry soap, so this little add in adds a nice fragrant smell to our clothes. Good deal and a coupon to boot! Thanks Amazon :)"
5.00,"Love this product! Only negative is the price. :) Scent does seem to linger on my clothes and towels for quite a long time!"
5.00,"Leaves my laundry fresh smelling!"
5.00,"I love this scent, but it was much cheaper here than in the store. I will continue to buy this, and it's a larger size than in stores."
5.00,"Love this stuff! It makes my laundry smell so fresh! I like the convenience of home delivery! It makes life easier!"
5.00,"The Downy Unstopables are great! Sprinkle in your wash and everything smells good!You can over do it. Less is more here. I also just leave the lid open to freshen the room! Two different scents. Both are great! If you are looking to freshen your world the Unstopables are for you. I Wouldnt buy it from Amazon again. I paid 15 dollars and then they showed up at our local grocery store for 7 with an introductory deal and they ended up being 2 dollars!"
5.00,"I bought this for my husband's pillow case that tends to smell not-so-nice. My daughter used it for her gym clothes and then her boyfriend started using it too. This is good for smelly clothes. We use Method detergent that isn't fragrant, so when we want to overwhelm stinky clothes with a more pleasant scent, this is our go to product. Recommend."
3.00,"I make my own laundry detergent but needed something to make it smell better and these work amazingly. They smell SO good and with a family of four this bottle lasts a good amount of time. They are a little bit more than I wanted to spend but you can almost always find a coupon for these which make it a little better."
1.00,"We use this item to freshen up our wash as our HE machine gives off a non-clean odor. It works for that purpose though the real solution is to get rid of the side load HE machine. You can find this item for 6.99 at local stores."
4.00,"I have been a purchaser of Downy Unstopables since receiving a sample in the mail when they were released. I hoarded that sample, waiting for the perfect time to experiment. I used it on a batch of towels--the amazing scent lasted for DAYS (until they needed to be re-washed that is!). Also, I cannot use fabric softener because of my sensitive skin (I break out from the \"softening\" grease or whatever it is)- so while everyone in the household smelled fresh, I just smelled...well, \"clean\" I guess. However, sometimes we'd get a cheaper detergent on sale, and the smell wouldn't be so pleasant on it's own- forcing me to spray all my clothes with Febreeze or perfume before leaving the house. This has solved EVERYTHING! While they are a tad bit of a luxury item (I will ONLY buy them on sale and usually with a coupon), they do work fantastically! I've purchased both the \"Fresh\" and \"Lush\" and, while I like Fresh better, both have worked well. I use a typical, old-school top-loader and have had no problems with spotting or undissolved beads. I also wash \"warm\" which is really more of a \"lukewarm\" on my washer. The smell of \"Lush\" definitely doesn't stay as much as \"Fresh\" does (I have a thick denim trenchcoat I washed with \"Fresh\" over 2 months ago, and it STILL SMELLS AWESOME! It was to the extent that my mother kept walking past where it was hanging and asking why all my laundry smells so great all of a sudden. I caught her huffing my jacket!) However, I have just washed all my bedding with \"Lush\" and mixed in a little bit of \"Fresh\" and it was an absolute pleasure to crawl into bed last night. When I made my bed this morning, I still smelled the freshness. This is also in a room with 7 small animals (I run a rat rehabilitation and rescue) and seven cats that run around the bed all day. It helps to not only scent the fabric, but the room as well. Sadly, I will only give 4 stars because of the price on here (it IS cheaper in the grocery store). Also, I have not compared this product to others like it, simply because of not wanting to spend the money on something that may not work. It's sort of my \"if it ain't broke, don't fix it\" mentality. Though I hope to get some samples of other brands in the future to compare. And a second note- I have also read the article about \"alternate uses\" for Unstopables. While I love the idea of making fragrance sachets and scenting things in your car--DO NOT PUT THIS IN YOUR CAT'S LITTERBOX!! In reality, cats aren't even supposed to have scented litter, because naturally they need to smell where they've \"been.\" While most cats will tolerate scented litter, to add this much fragrance is simply an irritant and not safe for them. If you wouldn't let your baby stick their face in the bottle and rub it all over themselves without washing, you shouldn't let your cat do that either. Cats clean themselves, and this shouldn't be ingested! That being said- it is a great product for WASHING your pet's bedding to keep it fresh. Just don't go throwing beads all over them and their environment...that's not what the product was made for."
5.00,"I use with every load of laundry.It leaves your clothes smelling great and does an even better job when you you a same scent softener."
4.00,"Everyone in the house knows that the laundry is in the wash as the whole house will be filled with fragrance. There is no need to apply perfume as it smells great out of the wardrobe. Even the wardrobe smells great! Ummmm...."
5.00,"I love this product! I wish it came in bigger bottles, and was a little bit cheaper because I use so much!"
3.00,"I saw the commercial for this product and got excited. I've wanted nothing more from my laundry than a strong fresh scent. I picked this item up for about the same price as an average sized bottle of liquid downey. First off, I have to say that although packaging has never tilted my opinion of a product one way or another, the unstoppables bottle is awesome! I love the colors and I love the shape of the bottle. I ran two loads of laundry using the unstoppables as well as liquid downey, as I was hoping for twice the scent power....In one load, I used a small amount of the beads and though my clean laundry smelled a little better than usual, the scent did not smack me across the face (and I was hoping it would). In another load, I used a lot of the beads and the laundry smelled better but I wasn't overwhelmed. About a week after doing the loads of launrdy, I went back to smell the clean clothes to see whether the scents lasted and sadly I wasn't impressed. Simply put, it appears, at least in my personal case, that I will have to use A LOT of the unstoppables to achieve a strong, long-lasting scent...And if I use A LOT, I will be going through a bottle of the unstoppables every 2 weeks and that is not financially smart for me since doing the launrdy in the past with just downey liquid softener is enough to get a decent smell. I think if you are willing to throw in a ton of the unstoppables in each load of launrdy and can afford to keep buying as it will run out quickly, then it is a great buy. Because I had to use so much of the product to achieve what I was hoping to with less and combined with the not so cheap price, I gave it 3 stars."
5.00,"I simply use this product the way it's instructed. I add it to my laundry and it leaves my clothes smelling good for weeks! It is amazing what a little cap of these can do! Definitely worth it!"
5.00,"this is the best i have come across for Laundry. they need to make different scents. other wise a great project"
5.00,"I use Downy Unstoppables in EVERY load. they make my clothes so fresh smelling long after the wash cycle."
4.00,"It's all about life's little pleasures ... like opening one's linen closet and being welcomed with a fresh scent. That was pretty much what I was seeking in Downy Unstoppables. Here is my report:                                                                     -When I saw the blue hue of the product, I had an instant worry: \"Will the color deposit on my clothes? Especially those washed in a delicate cycle? Or laundered in cold water?\" Answer: There was no color deposited whatsoever. Not on my whites, not on my delicates washed on gentle, and not those wash in cold water. Good news, right?                                                                     -Second worry: \"Will these little tablets completely dissolve or will they leave a mess in my washer?\" Answer: Happily, there was no residue (at all) on the inside of my washer. They dissolved completely.                                                                     -Last worry: \"Will the scent be too feminine for my boyfriend's clothes?\" Answer: No, it is merely a fresh scent. It is more subtle than I imagined, but it is definitely present. The scent can be described as just plain \"clean.\"                                                                     Since the overall scent was slightly more subtle than I expected, I'm not certain I would buy these again (since it may seem that my fabric softener and dryer sheets leave a somewhat similar fragrance). However, I should note that after placing my towels in the linen closet and returning an hour later, I genuinely was greeted with a lovely smell upon opening the door. That may be worth the price after all!"
5.00,"I tried out Downy Unstoppables when I received a sample in the mail, with a load of sheets. I was thoroughly impressed!! Since then so have switched to the Lush scent & have not regretted it. For those concerned about extra cost, I buy the \"try me\" size on sale with a coupon & then use just a small amount only on things I don't wash every single day, such as curtains, comforters, blankets, etc & on linens. I also use in the loads of seasonal clothes that I pack up. So far, so good. Also, my husband is allergic to practically EVERYTHING & I can't use Febreze so I just dissolved a little bit of this with water in a spray bottle & use it as a fabric refresher & it works wonders!!! DEFINITELY worth it!!"
5.00,"I purchased this product after hearing about it since it's release.  I really wanted to have a fragrance booster for use with towels and sheets since I don't use fabric softener on those two types of items.  As for towels, when washed with fabric softener it makes them smell great for sure, BUT you can end up standing there forever just trying to get yourself dried off with them due to the water repelling nature of the softener!  For sheets, I was told by my dermatologist that the use of fabric softener actually leads to breakouts and clogged pores due to the chemicals in fabric softener.                                                                     So, on I went to give the \"Unstopables\" a try.  Wow, is all I can say!  Not only do these make your towels, sheets, and whatever else you choose to use them with smell amazing, but the scent lasts such a long time.  The linen closet in the bathroom has never smelled fresher, and the laundry room as well!  It's also wonderful when you are actually doing the wash, as the scent from the Downy flows throughout the area and is so nice.                                                                     As for the use of these, you simply take off the cap and pour in a little or a lot - this depends on your desires for the level of scent.  That's all there is to it.                                                                     It is important to note that you cannot put these in the detergent or fabric softener tray on front loaders as per the directions - you simply just toss it in the wash with the laundry before you start the load and you are off to fresher, cleaner smelling clothes.                                                                     By the way, you can find these cheaper than Amazon at Wal-Mart and Target, so I suggest checking there before purchasing online!                                                                     2 thumbs up for these in my book!"
4.00,"Love the scent. I thought I was getting a deal but in fact it would have been less expensive had I purchased this item at a local store."
2.00,"Has a very pungent chemical smell which overpowers the floral scent. More expensive that Purex Crystals and doesn't work as well. I did not notice much scent when I removed towels from the dryer, nor after being stored in the linen closet. Tried this product once more and disposed of the bottle. Will not purchase again."
5.00,"I received this product through VocalPoint prior to its release in stores.                                                                     You can add as much or as little of this as you'd like to your wash, and you put it in at the very beginning.  I don't typically use any fabric softener during the wash - just detergent.  My washing machine is older and there's no dispenser for fabric softener, and I don't really like using the Downy ball.  So, this was really nice to be able to just throw in at the beginning and then be able to have the nice, long-lasting smell similar to what fabric softener would give you.                                                                     It's very fresh and clean smelling - something that's appropriate for my clothes and my husband's clothes.  I didn't use it on every single load, but I really liked using it for things like sheets and towels.  They still smell fresh even after being folded and stored away for a little while.  The first day I wore an item of clothing that had been washed with the Downy Unstopables, I could smell it on myself throughout the day, but it wasn't overpowering or offensive - just a nice, clean smell every now and then.                                                                     Depending on how expensive this is in stores, I would definitely consider purchasing it.  I haven't seen it yet, but then again, I haven't been in the laundry section recently either.                                                                     Overall, I would recommend this product."
5.00,"I love this stuff, I wish they sold it in larger bottles. It keeps my laundry fresh for weeks. I tried another brand and it does not compare. I will be going back to this!"
5.00,"This is a great add-on to laundry detergent plus it keeps the front loaded washers smelling fresh longer!! Highly recommended"
5.00,"I use this to help my son in laws work uniform smell a lot better  Very Pleased  I will get this again"
5.00,"I use it in every load of laundry! I put a little in a cup in my car to make it smell fantastic! I even melt it in my tart warmers and my whole house smells fresh! so being a member of Prime and having this stuff on automatic delivery was a must!"
1.00,"These things are horrible and I will never buy them again. They leave oil stains on clothing. The first time I used them I noticed a few shirts were stained when I was hanging them. I thought maybe I didn't notice the stains before I washed them. I just used it on my bedding which was not stained and now it has dark oil stains all over and is ruined. I cannot believe they sell this crap!"
4.00,"I love the Downy scent boosters, makes my laundry smell amazing. However in general they are expensive. I bought this using an AMAZON coupon so got a great price. Also you can use these in tart burners for a cheaper way to make your house smell great!"
5.00,"I got this item for my diy laundry soap I make and I really love the smell of the Shimmer Scent"
4.00,"Works good but should be cheaper in my opinion. If you want your clothes to smell really good you need to use a whole capfull and at that point the bottle wont last very long at all..."
5.00,"The scent of this is truly amazing. I wouldn't have believed it until I ordered it. It is just delightful!"
5.00,"I love this product. I mix it in my homemade laundry detergent to scent it. It dissolves easily and leave my clothes smelling wonderful."
5.00,"First let me say that I agree with those that have said that Unstopables is pretty pricey. I typically save it for my grocery runs where I have a little room to \"splurge\" on a few things. I rarely see them on sale but this week they were $1 off at both Target and here on Amazon so I stocked up!                                                                     I work part-time as a waitress and as you can probably guess, often come home smelling like \"restaurant.\" I wear an older coat that I don't mind getting a little smelly or stained. Last week I washed it with Unstopables and in the 4 shifts I've worked since then, it STILL smells wonderful! In fact, when I walk into the break room that's the first thing that I smell! I've heard coworkers comment on how good it smells in there. I also use it when washing my uniform and I always smell just as good when I leave as when I get there, which really says something. The scent is not over-powering, though. To me it smells as strong as a fabric softener (which I use as well), it just happens to last longer.                                                                     Of course, like other reviewers said, towels and sheets stay smelling nice longer, both when being used and being stored. I use it when washing our comforter and it leaves the whole room smelling wonderful for a couple of weeks afterward. Overall, I'll keep buying as long as they keep selling it!"
4.00,"I had company stay at our house and I washed the guest sheets with detergent and used the free Unstopables sample about a week and a half before company came. (I don't use dryer sheets because it is bad for the dryer thermostat, and I don't use fabric softner because it is bad for the washer.) Our company commented on how wonderful climbing into the bed was each night and how well it smelled. After they left we got busy and I didn't get around to washing the sheets right away, but when I did a month after they were washed the first time, they STILL SMELLED great! I wish it wasn't so expensive, but I now use it for all our sheets and towels. If the price comes down I might use it on all of our wash."
3.00,"This does nothing to help clean your laundry - all it do is add scent to your clothes.  If you really like 'clean' scented clothing then you will probably like this - it's easy to use, all you do is add the little 'pebbles' to your washer before running it, and that's it.  To me clean smelling clothes have NO scent at all, a scent is not needed to indicate clean clothing, it's just an added benefit.                                                                     I liked the scent of this product, but it was just way too strong on our clothing after a full wash and dry cycle, it just lingers in your nostrils and never goes away until you take the clothing off.  If it wasn't so strong I would like it more.                                                                     If you have somebody who is very sensitive to scents/perfumes than this product likely is not for you."
5.00,"Tide is always a good detergent. I never have problems with this brand it gets clothes clean and is not overly heavy with perfumes."
4.00,"I have used both scents & prefer the lavender (purple). Kind of pricey so I only use the product when washing towels that need a \"scent boost\"! I would use more often if not for the cost."
5.00,"Lets face it. Liquid fabric softener is a mess. No matter how careful you are you're bound to get it on the outside of the washer or in places that water doesn't normally touch which leaves stains to clean up later. With pellets it's just dumb and go. No spills to clean up. Unless you spill the bottle on the floor."
2.00,"I tried the sample of this that came in the mail. It was way too stong for my liking. I had used it on a comforter so during the night I had to get up and move it to the closet. The smell still came through. I ended up moving the comforter downstairs. If you need something strong to cover odors, like smoke or pet, then I'd say this is a good choice. If you are looking for something to lightly fragrance your laundry, you should probably pass or use about a 1/3 of the recommended amount."
1.00,"I ordered it after all the reviews about it and also seeing others use it. I did use it as directed at the start of the wash cycle and guess what, the pellets did not dissolve completely and left all the white residue clinging to my socks. This would have been forgotten if they at-least smelled, but nothing. No smell, no scent or \"NOTHING UNSTOPPABLE\" about this. Waste of money. Use it to buy dryer sheets which are way more effective than this.."
4.00,"I've been using a laundry washing product without any scent, and it gets the clothes really clean. I missed the nice fresh scent so I went this route. Perfect solution! Don't expect the scent to last several weeks, tho. The scent may be stronger than a simple rinse with liquid Downey, but it lasts only a few days longer than the liquid alternative."
5.00,"I will not do my laundry unless I have my Downey Unstopables....and what they claim is true about the smell lasting for weeks... And all you have to do is fill the top of the cup to the desired line and throw it in with your dirty clothes and that is it...and when they come out of the dryer, WOW, they smell so wonderful....You must try this product, you will love it... So will your family!!!!"
5.00,"Goodbye dryer sheets and messy fabric liquid fabric softener! We're relatively sensitive around here(my kids were getting excema when I was using dryer sheets and reguar laundry detergent). Now using free and clear detergent but thought I'd give these a try. So far, no bad reactions but I'll update if it become problematic. This is my favorite scent- very fresh and springy without being cloying."
5.00,"Perfect for my husbands work clothes and the other garments that you can't use Fabric softener."
5.00,"I used these in my wax warmer and it made my house smell amazing! They took a little longer to melt than traditional wax melts."
5.00,"I have to say I'm addicted to this product. I use the Fresh Scent in combination with method unscented detergent (I like Method) and downy softener. I put the product directly on the washer, then the clothes, and for towels and sheets I put a bit more after (on top), just because I love the smell so much. I get dizzy with strong smells, and this is just the perfect amount of scent. I am also very allergic, and this product is ok on my skin. The smells does not last for a long long time, but it will hold a couple of days on your sheets and towels. I always get compliments from my guests about the smell on my linen, so I guess it is not just me who likes this product."
3.00,"I've seen this product on the shelf at the store; it made me very curious. Is it a softening booster, or just a scent booster...or what *is* it? I'd take them down and sniff, and wonder what their purpose was.So, when I finally got a bottle of it, I was really anxious to see what this stuff would do. Who wouldn't like having sheets and towels that still smell fresh a long time after laundering?The instructions tell you to add this product (as much or as little as you want) directly to your washer. I have a front-loader so I was a little hesitant to try this, I thought maybe I'd end up with little bits of undissolved product all over, but it did fine. (I did two loads, with different amounts of Unstopables beads in them)While my washer was going, the rooms all around my laundry room smelled fabulous, and ditto while the clothes were drying! I had high hopes for this product and pictured saving it for things like comforters, towels, sheets...But once I took the clothes out of the dryer and hung them up, I didn't notice any extra scent above and beyond what I normally get with a liquid or sheet fabric softener. The bonus to the softeners is added static repellency and softness; the Unstopable is just a fragrancing product. The smell was fabulous, but it just didn't 'stick'.Bottom line on this, I had better results with the GAIN laundry products for lasting scent. GAIN products are just about ALL fragrance and leave a long-lasting scent. The Downy didn't give results anywhere near the GAIN products, and the Downy product costs a lot more. I did put the rest of the crystals into some old socks I had, tied them up, and they are now fragrancing drawers, closets, under the bed, etc."
5.00,"I LOVE this product!! My husband is a Heating Tech. in Alaska and sometimes comes home smelling like the fuel we use to heat our homes! Since starting to use this product, his uniforms come out of the washer smelling great!! I've also been in animal rescue for over 40 years.... No matter what I've used in the past, stinky dog bedding doesn't always come out of the washer smelling very fresh and over time I just throw it away. They do now!! Our everyday garments, towels, sheets, etc... smell great too! This is one product I'll continue to use! Faithfully!!!"
5.00,"I love the way this makes my laundry smell. I use about a cap in a large load, and it smells wonderful! I recently went on vacation and all the laundry packed in my suitcase smelled lovely, even the items that were not washed with Downy. The scent lasts quite awhile too. At least 3 weeks, is what I have kept track of. It's great for washing towels and bedding in before putting in linen closet. Love the way my sheets hold the scent even when put on the bed!"
5.00,"Makes your clothes have a great smell and your linen press. I never put a full capful ... only use a good sprinkle but that would be up to the individual. My children love it as well."
5.00,"I often want my clothes to smell well and so far this is the only softener that does it really well"
5.00,"It really made my laundry feel and smell fresh and wonderful..Just cannot live without smelling the scent on my clothes.."
4.00,"These beads smell so amazing. I don't use it in the wash. Instead I put it in small mesh bags and put them in my dresser drawers, shoe closet, and just around the house. They aren't nauseating/overpowering, yet the fresh scent lasts for weeks and weeks. The only reason its 4 stars and not 5 is because it doesn't actually serve any other purpose but for smell. I wish it actually washed AND smelled great."
2.00,"I'm a HUGE fan of Unstoppables...just not this fragrance. It's incredibly strong & smells like nothing you'd expect from Downy (i.e., fresh, clean, etc.). I guarantee this scent will be pulled sooner than later. For now, stick with the blue & purple containers. They smell AMAZING!!"
5.00,"My mom uses this for my laundry in the wash especially because I tend to sweat and my dirty clothes smell not so great at times. But, she uses only a little bit in a load like almost less than half of the cap and it smells great. I just had to get my own for when I go to college because it leaves my clothes smelling amazing. I get compliments that I smell like laundry sometimes just because of this product mainly. Just to say how long the smell lasts I packed up some of my clothes for college a little over a month ago but I took a shirt to wear from this box just the other day and it smelled the same from when it first came out the dryer my mom said she could smell the laundry smell on me. We pretty much stopped using dryer sheets because of Unstopables because they became useless when my family started to use this product. I love it! Its also a little bit cheaper here than in grocery stores if you want to save a few cents and is delivered on time."
5.00,"This is the best laundry product I have ever found. It smells amazing and lasts forever. People around me are constantly trying to figure out what smells so good. (it's me) :) My favorite use is for my sheets. It lasts forever and I can't wait to crawl into bed after I've washed my sheets with Unstopables."
5.00,"Nice change. I'm a fan of Unstopables and this scent is more subtle and calming for me. Good stuff. :)"
4.00,"I love this stuff. It makes the wash smell so fresh and clean. The scent lasts quite a while, and you don't have to use much so the package lasts through many, many washes."
5.00,"Downy Unstopables.... Oh how I hated you(for the price) when you were released, however after getting samples I cannot go without them. The Blue is definitely the way to go. I do not use the cap, and I eyeball the amount I add."
3.00,"Great scent but my Gain detergent lasts just as long. To me, this is an unnecessary purchase. I suppose it might be good for some really stinky clothes. :-)"
2.00,"I got a sample of Downy Unstopable fresh scent, boy is it strong. It said it was for one load but I have done 2 loads so far, put a few of the pills around my house in different rooms and still have half the sample pack!!! Now back to my review on Purex Crystals...Went to Walmart to buy some Downy Unstopables but found that the Purex Crystals were cheaper so I figured they would be the same so I bought it, WRONG!!!! After I got it home I noticed that the scent was NO WHERE NEAR as strong as the Downy Unstopable but decided to give it a try anyway. I put the full amount that the directions called for in the wash and did the load. When they were dry you could barely smell any scent at all. When I compared it to the clothes I washed with the Downy Unstopable it was laughable!!! The Downy Unstopable wash was done 4 days earlier and still had in my opinion a little to strong of a scent where the Purex Crystal wash that was done and hour ago, barely had a scent at all!!! The Downy Unstopable wash had ONE QUARTER the amount the directions called for and the Purex Crystal wash had the full amount the directions called for. I am TAKING THE PUREX CRYSTALS BACK and getting the Downy Unstopable..I will save money by using one quarter the amount in my wash and I will have plenty of scent in my clothes compared to the Purex Crystals. Do your self a favor, smell the Downy Unstopable and the Purex Chrystals bottle at the store...Downy Unstopable is much stronger and it will be stronger at home. Might be a little more expensive but you will be using a lot less of the Downy Unstopable in your wash. Long run the Downy will be much cheaper. Sorry Purex Crystal but you are getting returned for Downy Unstopable!!!"
5.00,"I never knew about this product and when I saw it I said what the heck why not try it. I am addicted!! I love it and the scent lasts pretty long on the linens depending on how much you put .. I like all the scents so far"
4.00,"No matter what we did or what detergent we used, my husband always felt his clothes did not smell that great after washing. This product has changed all that.... A cup full of the beads before I put the clothes in the washer makes it all come out smelling good. If you like your laundry to have a scent, I definitely recommend this product."
5.00,"I tell everyone at work about this product. It is amazing! I use it especially for bedding, towels and workout gear. The smell it delivers can be overwhelming for some, but I absolutely love it. It almost smells like a perfume and it definitely adds softness to my clothes. I love getting in to bed on freshly washed sheets, because this smell is evident and it's a relaxing smell at bedtime. For obvious reasons I would recommend this product for workout clothes/towels also. I will most definitely buy this product again."
5.00,"I've purchased this product in the Shimmer scent, it comes in a pink container. Not only does this product make my whole house smell amazing while the clothes are washing, but my laundry smells amazing after having been in the drawer for weeks, or if I've used them on bed linens and comforters, they STILL smell incredible! I love having sweet smelling clothes and towels!"
5.00,"i really like the fragrances of several downy softeners, but this stuff is fantastic. i think it makes a difference. my clothes smell wonderful for such a long time. i just add a capful with every load during the wash cycle. i get it automatically delivered every month with my save and subscribe!"
1.00,"I love the smell but the crystals did not dissolve in my brand new high efficiency whirlpool washer. I placed them in the drum per direction (not in the solution drawer) and when the washer was finished the undissolved crystals were stuck in the drain holes of my washer."
4.00,"I love these! They are easy to use... just ad a capful of the beads to your regular wash load at the same time you ad your soap. I've had no problems with them dissolving or leaving residues. They make our laundry smell extra nice and come in a few different scents. These are also nice to use on towels, sheets, comforters, and pet bedding."
5.00,"I have a front loader washer and this is the only fabric softener that actually makes my washer smell good!!! My clothes have a nice, subtle smell that last for weeks and my towels always smell fresh!!!"
5.00,"Nice clean sent, love this!"
5.00,"Excellent product. Makes your clothes smell wonder and the smell lasts for days and days. Only wish it came in a bigger container and lasts longer !"
4.00,"This product is probably not for the average household as it will add quite a bit of expense to laundry costs just for a little bit more scent. We don't usually have a problem with our laundry and between the detergent and the dryer sheets, our laundry ends up smelling fine for quite awhile. It does add a nice scent to the laundry but not that much more than before. You also might end up with objections from the male personnel in your house regarding how their clothes end up smelling, perhaps a bit too fresh for their liking? For me, I like the results but probably won't spend the money or time for every laundry load but save it for my special clothes or for linens we would reserve for guests.                                                                     This is a really nice product that seems to do what it says but may not be useful or cost effective for every laundry load but would definitely be nice to have on hand for special laundry loads. I will definitely buy this product again when I use up this bottle."
1.00,"These are nasty and way too purfumy. My friend uses these and i gag when i hug her. Bad product"
5.00,"We have used this product for years, I buy through amazon because of the subscribe and save savings, along with the amazon mom savings its a steal. Be sure to \"clip coupons\" that are avail on amazon too - you'll save even more :-). In winter you may still need fabric softner to eliminate static cling if you live in a dry climate."
4.00,"I thought I'd try these out to see how well they work. The directions advise one to add a little or a lot - pretty vague - so you have to find your way.  I've found about 1/2 cap works great on towels when using no fabric softener.  I've found on clothes that you have to add a fair amount to overpower fabric softener scent at which point the odor can become a bit cloying.  I believe going forward, I will only use this product for towels and bedding, but that's OK as these flakes/crystals impart a fresh scent without being overpowering for these items.  I will buy again."
5.00,"Downy unstopables are the best. I don't know that I would ever stop using them. They make the laundry smell so wonderful for quite a long time."
5.00,"I am a gym addict and my morning begins with cardio and weights, or hot yoga; but as much fun as my workouts are, trying to keep my clothes fresh is quite another problem - and here is my challenge: After working out I get ready at the gym and go to work, leaving my work out clothes stuffed in the little plastic bag the gym provides, which then stays in my gym bag, in my hot car...for the entire work day! The end result is not pretty!! My beloved gym outfits from Athleta which look pretty and cost a pretty penny...do not smell pretty, even after a good warm wash!! The cooking of sweat in a plastic bag all day is hard for any detergent and machine to boot and these clothes cannot withstand a hot wash! Enter Downy Unstopables....they work!! My go to routine is Tide (ideally with a good strong scent) a warm wash and a liberal scoop of these beads! My work out clothes smell wonderful!! In fact, the smell stays several days so when I retrieve my outfits out of my closet, they still have a pleasant but not overwhelming scent compared to fabric softener which tends to dissapate very quickly! These have become a lifesaver for me and my workout clothes...and Amazon prices are pretty great too!!"
1.00,"I got a free sample of this.  The smell was so bad I had to wrap it in plastic and take it outside.  It was that horrible fake chemical smell.                                                                     Not sure how it works."
5.00,"these smell sooo good.. the bottle says it lasts 12 weeks... I don't agree with that but it does last awhile.. & the price is awesome... esp with add on option"
5.00,"I really like the long-lasting scent this imparts. doesn't do anything for static, but I'm fine with that. I never have much luck with traditional fabric softener for that anyway. the smell lasts for quite a while. Definitely recommend!"
5.00,"I'm a college student living in the dorms and i have to share the washers with hundreds of other people living in my building, so you can imagine how often they get cleaned (my money's on never) and i have neither the time nor patience to clean them myself. so after a while everything that was coming out of my wash had kind of a nasty dirty-washer smell (and i have a very bad sense of smell, so if i could smell it, it has to be bad), and i really don't like going around having my clothes smell like that. I remembered seeing commercials for this and thought i'd give it a try. anything was better than smelling like the dirty washers, so i bought it and gave it a try. since i wasn't sure how much to put in, i put in very very little and am happy to report that even that did the job wonderfully. So if you're living in a building with community washers i highly recommend this product because it does leave your clothes smelling nice."
5.00,"love love love it !!!!!!!!!! This produt is one of my all time favorites. My dog sweaters smell great. My husband love the smell of his work clothes.I use very good laundry detegents and fabric sheets but the smell does not last as long as the Downy Unstopables."
5.00,"This has the freshest, most wonderful smell. There is nothing else like it. I thought I liked the blue Downy Unstoppables, but this Scent Booster is the BEST!"
4.00,"I really love the smell of this product. It reminds me of one of Victoria's Secret scents (I believe it is the Pink color one). I added about half the cap into my laundry and I can smell it faintly on my laundry. I actually poured some of this in a little open container to put in my closet. It helps to disseminate the smell a little. It was a good one-time buy (since it was on sale), but I am not sure about long term."
5.00,"Well, after a short trial, we subscribed for this. It is great and half what the food markets want. Duh."
5.00,"You are definitely going to want to purchase an entire case of this scent. The fragrance is a very light scent but it truly does resemble a melon candy of sorts."
5.00,"I love these little beads. All my laundry smells great. Perfect for the husband's stinky gym clothes. Now when he sweats, his clothes still smell good!"
5.00,"I have had the same bottle for a few months now since you really only need to use a little bit. I try to line dry everything so this works at leaving a nice scent behind. I have tried this one and fresh scent and both are nice."
5.00,"very pleasant scent, which lasts long, even my walk-in closet smells amazing because of this, recommended... one cup is more than enough for a single load"
5.00,"This stuff is awesome...Makes our clothes smell yummy... I have found that I only like this scent though as the other Unstopable scents are a bit too strong for my taste. Love this stuff!"
4.00,"Walmart - Tide pods are back! Tide Pods - $2.24 Use-$1.50/2 Tide Pods, Gain Flings, Downy Unstopables or Gain... http://t.co/6VyS5qf9M4"
3.00,"I received a packet of the blue Downy Unstopables as a free sample in the mail. The package said to use the whole pack in one load so I did. The smell was absolutely amazing! I could smell my clothes through the laundry room wall all the way through my apartment (my apartment shares a wall with my floor's laundry room). The smell lasted for weeks! I loved it.So, the next time I had some extra money, I went to the store. A feeling inside me urged me to stick with the blue ones since the sample was so extraordinary but, as we do sometimes, I ignored that urging voice and threw the purple Lush Scent into my cart instead.The first time I used it I must have used way too little because I barely smelled anything in my clothes. Some of my clothes had NO scent on it.The second time I used it I put the equivalent size as the sample package and while the scent was stronger than the first time I used the Lush Scent, it still did NOT come even close to the strength of the blue ones.The third time I washed, I put even MORE in and still, not as strong as the blue ones but at least I smell something in all of my clothes and bedding.I don't think I'll ever purchase this Lush scented Unstopable again. I'm sticking with the tried and true blue package."
5.00,"Makes our clothes smell great - I'm really impressed! I use a little more than half a cap each time."
3.00,"I bought this because I wanted to use it for my guest room linens thinking I they don't get used often at least they will still have a laundry scent for the next guest (I usually wash immediately after a guest leaves so its fresh and ready for the next). But I tried on towels and I think when the towels are wet it smells a little funny."
4.00,"The Fresh Scent is great for my somewhat musky smelling athletic wear, mostly yoga clothes but sometimes I find it a bit overwhelming for sheets and such so this scent is perfect those things that need less scent boosting."
5.00,"Upon receiving this I was a bit perplexed by the instructions.  Essentially, it says \"shake a little or a lot\" of the Unstopables into the cap.  Then add to your load before you start the cycle.  I was confused by what a little or a lot would mean so of course it took some experimenting to find the balance for me.  I am sure that, depending on they type of machine you have and the size of load you are washing, results will very.  But honestly that is no different then experimenting with any other laundry product.  After about five cycles I have mastered the proper amount and the results are fantastic!  I have a front load washer and found that I only need to use a very small amount (between 15-20 kernels, full load) of Unstopables to achieve a fresh scent, that isn't overpowering and will last for weeks.                                                                     The best way to describe the result is that I can put my towels away in the closet and even after 2 weeks they come out smelling fresh.  It's not so overpowering that every time I walk past the closet it is all I smell.  When opening the closet you do receive a lovely clean waft of fresh air.  If you compare it to the man/woman that wears to much perfume/cologne... this is not the case.  Sure, if you hug me, you'll smell it and say, your clothes smell really clean.  But, if I walk through a room you won't even notice it.                                                                     Ultimately, the simplicity of this product is what makes it great.  It doesn't harm the color of your clothing and is perfect for all colors.  It even works to add fresh scent to white's you have thoroughly bleached. Considering the amount I use per load, this will serve around 80-100 loads.  Well worth the investment to complement the large detergents serving 96 loads."
5.00,"I just love how the add a boost of great scent to my wash! It almost has a slight mint scent which also makes the house smell good while the washer is running. I don't use them every load but I do especially with towels and gym clothes!"
5.00,"I tried these for the first time and much to my surprise it had a really nice smell. It was not overpowering as so many on. I would recommend this product."
5.00,"Love this liquid detergent!!! Leaves your clothes smelling \"just washed and dried\" for several days. It is kind of difficult to keep in the grocery store."
5.00,"I love adding these to my laundry bags, it leaves your clothes smelling super fresh but not overpowering! I recommend it to anyone deployed that has to turn laundry bags in!"
4.00,"I love using this product in my washing machine during the wash cycle. The smell is very nice and lingers on the clothes. I especially like when I take out towels and sheets and I still get a whiff of the aroma."
5.00,"This stuff makes my whole house smell good while doing laundry. My clothes smell great for a really long time, and I get compliments from people about how great I smell. I work in a hospital and it hasn't ever upset anyone with allergies either."
4.00,"The instructions say to put as many as you want in the cap and put them in the wash.  So the first time it was for some towels so I put just over half a capfull - it was WAY too much!  My laundry room was very, very \"scented\" and so were the towels.  In fact, using them after a shower I discovered the scent transferred to me.  I had to re-wash them all.                                                                     Next time, I was using it for a few undergarments and white socks I used very few -- maybe 1/6 of a capfull.  That turned out pretty good and now everything has a nice smell but not overpowering.                                                                     A good product but just a caution to not overuse!"
4.00,"I like this product and for the size, the price was good. I use this in all my dark loads and it leaves a nice scent."
5.00,"I first used this product while staying at a friends house, washed all my clothes before leaving town. Later on when I arrived to my place I noticed the fresh smell Gosh, it was worth it, it's really neat to smell the freshness every time you put your clothes on.                                                                     It's expensive, no doubt about it, at that price point seems more a luxury than something you buy without hesitation."
5.00,"I LOVE THE SMELL of \"Shimmer\", it's fresh & clean & feminine!!! I use the \"Fresh Scent\" for my husbands clothes and he too LOVES the way his clothes smell. Our clothes smell so good and for a week or two after I wash them! I especially LOVE it for our bedding/sheets, towels as well as clothes. Our house smells good on \"Laundry Day\" as it permiates through the air and actually for the first time in my life makes me enjoy doing laundry & I NEVER thought I'd hear myself saying that!! Thanks Downy for FINALLY coming up with something that actually keeps your laundry smelling as fresh & clean as the day you washed them!"
5.00,"I use these in the washer & line dry my sheets and comforters vs. the dryer! They smell so very good, my sister stayed over and wanted to know what on earth I was using."
5.00,"Our homemade washing powder which cleans very well has no fragrance but we take these and throw a few in with the load and the clothes always smell wonderful and one bottle last us several months ( maybe 2 of these a year ) plus 15$ every two years for the washing powder (easy) and you save a ton over the going every month and spending 10$ to have laundry detergent in a bottle that takes a lot of trash can space up (saving here too) because you wont be buying trash can liners as much. For clothes that smell great when we spend 39$ every two years. And 10$ x 24 = 240$ THATS SAVINGS TO ME."
5.00,"I am going to be spoiled with all these great scents. I love the fresh clean smell my laundry is left with."
5.00,"I'm a sucker for that fresh out of the wash smell and this product, as it name implies, boosts that scent. It's particularly great to use on gym clothes, or on our dog blankets. The fresh scent smells the 'cleanest' whereas the other scents smell more perfume-y, but to each their own."
1.00,"We have a nice HE washer but miss the nice smell of the standard washers. Skip this product. No scent added."
5.00,"I received a sample of this in the mail a few weeks ago - the blue scent. I had to decide what I wanted to try it on because the packet only contained enough product for one use. After some thinking, I finally decided to use it on my blanket. My blanket is already blue, so I cannot attest to weather the product stains or not, but I did not notice and discoloration. I used Arm & Hammer (yellow bottle, purple cap) laundry soap, plus the entire sample packet of the blue Downy Unstopables. When I took my blanket from the washer, the smell wasn't very strong and I was extremely disappointed! I threw it in the dryer and waited. I didn't have to wait for long though! As the blanket dried, a wonderful smell wafted up the stairs to meet me. I loved it! The whole house smelled fabulous, and after getting the blanket from the dryer - so did my room. That first night was a little powerful, I may have used a little too much - but it wasn't unbearable. Both of my dogs sleep at the end of my bed, on top of the blanket. The next day, only a little of the smell had worn off, just enough for a nice fresh smell. I also noticed my dogs also smelled wonderful from sleeping on the blanket, and I checked for rashes - they didn't have any. After about a week and a half, I noticed the smell starting to fade. After a full two weeks, the smell was as strong as normal fabric softener and a dryer sheet would produce. About halfway into the third week, the smell was very faint. With this product, before ordering from Amazon I would suggest going to a local store and finding which scent you enjoy most. I personally love the blue scent, but to each her own!"
5.00,"I was skeptical about using the Downy Unstopables because I was hesitant about the scent...What if I didn't like the way my towels smelled?  That would mean that I would have to re-wash an already clean batch of towels and sheets to get rid of what I perceived to be an offensive scent.  Well, that didn't happen as the fresh scent of the Unstopables is definitely a scent that I liked a lot, not flowery or overly sweet.  I do wish, however, that there was more information as to whether the scent would be obliterated when the towels were put into the dryer with dryer sheets which carry their own scent."
4.00,"I just LOVE this scent!  As do most of my family. It helps keep all our laundry (and I have five kids aging 2-16, currently) smelling fresh. An added bonus is climbing into bed each night for an entire week with sheets &amp; blankets that smell like they've just been washed that day.                                                                     &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 this!                                                                     (I don't dare ask what the ingredients all are for fear I'd not want to use it. But with severe asthma in three of us, it's the only fragrant item we've used that doesn't trigger asthma/allergy attacks! So it still gets my 4 stars, 5 if it miraculously had all green/healthy ingredients.)"
4.00,"Does have a nice smell but I can get that with fabric softener. If you want a booster on smell of washed clothing this is for you. nice product..........."
5.00,"These things make your laundry smell amazing. I use them every time I wash anything in the washer. I'm not a fan of the purple ones though but the blue teal ones are great."
5.00,"I used this instead of my usual mouthwash which is also crest and after 2 weeks I can see a difference and my mouth feels fresher after using it. Great product!"
5.00,"I love this brand. Its the only brand I buy for my whole family. It leaves my teeth feeling clean and white. I have always used the brand as a child and so have my kids. I don't forsee myself ever switching!"
5.00,"Yes, this product is pricier than some others. But my Granddad used to say, \" You get what you pay for.\" And that is very true for this product. With continued use it seems to keep your teeth cleaner longer."
4.00,"I really felt like this toothpaste got my teeth clean. It was a little higher in price."
5.00,"I was happy to be able to buy this product at Amazon, all other stores have stopped carrying and it is the best tooth paste to really clean your teeth."
1.00,"I bought this toothpaste at target because it was on sale for $2.17, now I know why. I've only been using it for about 4 days now and have already developed multiple sores inside my mouth because of it, it also seems to make my teeth very sensitive which they normally are not. How this product got past testing phases completely baffles me. This is designed to prevent oral irritation issues yet it does the complete opposite! Crest should be sued for letting this into the market, buyer beware."
5.00,"Love how clean my teeth feel afterwards and has a great flavor!"
4.00,"This product gets used every day in our house. I like how it freshers breath and makes my mouth feel clean. I cannot believe the difference it makes with bad breath. It works from the first use. It does have to be used daily for bad breath. I would recommend this to every one."
4.00,"Using the mouthwash resulted in a fresh feeling that lasted throught the day."
4.00,"I have used the Crest Pro-health rinse for several years now and there are many things that I like about it, and one that I don't. The rinse cleans up your mouth well without the burn that some brands have. The flavor is good too but that brings me to the negative. Do not use this rinse if you are going to eat or drink anything for about an hour. There is a linger taste that really ruins food/beverage taste. Otherwise, a good oral rinse."
5.00,"Leaves my mouth feeling clean. Love crest products!"
4.00,"It was pretty good toothpaste, nothing spectacular, but it got my teeth clean."
4.00,"I don't always like the taste of mouth wash, but this one I like a lot and my teeth don't feel like they have that icky film left on them."
5.00,"Loved how clean this made my teeth feel. My mouth was fresh for a long time."
5.00,"I use it everyday. With my sonicare electric tooth brush. My wife use it too. She use what I buy."
4.00,"The crest toothpaste makes my teeth feel like I just had a cleaning. The taste was so refreshing! I would recommend it to all."
5.00,"it made my mouth feel fresh and clean until the next brushing. it was great. it is already on my list to buy again!"
4.00,"The Crest Pro-health has minty crystals (not sure exactly what the correct term is) and it is very refreshing and clean feeling. I really like the way it makes my mouth feel, and my teeth seem whiter after using it for two weeks. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is the cap....maybe it's just \"user error\" but I don't like the flip cap. Toothpaste seems to ooze out and makes a mess. I like the screw tops on toothpaste. I would recommend using the toothpaste!"
5.00,"I love this new toothpaste. It tastes great and leaves my mouth feeling fresh."
5.00,"Loved this toothpaste. It left my whole mouth feeling clean."
1.00,"I can't believe I'm writing a review of something as trivial as toothpaste but I'm pretty angry right now. Me and my girlfriend just got a Costco membership, and we decided to buy toothpaste in bulk so we wouldn't have to buy single tubes anymore. I just grabbed this pack because it was the one closest to the register and figured which toothpaste I chose wouldn't matter because toothpaste is toothpaste...well apparently not.                                                                     This toothpaste sucks. First of all, it doesn't seem to foam up as well as other toothpastes and it leaves a really crappy feeling in my mouth after brushing. Brushing your teeth usually feels refreshing and other toothpastes I have used leave my mouth feeling minty. My mouth feels like crap after I brush my teeth. My mouth is very dried out and my tongue has a really unpleasant aftertaste. The worst thing is since I brush my teeth before bed, after I wake up my mouth feels even worse and even drier. Guess what the first thing I do when I wake up is?                                                                     On the way to work I noticed that for some reason there was a mucus like substance in my mouth and I had no idea what it was. It looks like I know what it is now.                                                                     It sucks even more now that I'm basically stuck with 4 tubes of this junk. I can't believe that I feel so ripped off buying toothpaste."
5.00,"I will have to get used to mouth rinses...This one is the first I tried and does the job right."
4.00,"Left my teeth feeling clean all day. My mouth was refreshed. Better than the Aquafresh toothpaste I use to use."
4.00,"Great product! I'm quite pleased with the good cleaning results and pleasant taste."
5.00,"Crest Pro-Health Clinical Plaque Control Toothpaste really gets the job done.My teeth feel like a million bucks when I brush with it unlike most other brands of toothpaste.I love this stuff!"
5.00,"mouth felt fresh for longer the most mouth washes."
5.00,"Made my teeth feel super smooth and clean. Loved it"
4.00,"I like this mouthwash because of the plaque control..It has a great taste and doesn't sting my gums."
4.00,"I love the minty flavor of the Crest 3D white Multi-care Whitening Rinse. I drink a lot of coffee and tea and the product claims to protect against stains. So far, so good!"
4.00,"Made my mouth feel fresh and clean. Would buy it again."
5.00,"The toothpaste is wonderful. My kids liked it and we will be using it in the future."
4.00,"I really liked this toothpaste. The flavor was good without being overwhelming. It left my teeth feeling clean and my breath smelling fresh. Thanks for sharing...I will absolutely consider purchasing this product in the future."
5.00,"I have always been a fan of Crest toothpaste. Crest pro-health was another hit with its plaque control...my teeth felt fresher and cleaner than ever."
5.00,"Happy mouth and teeth.. :) will keep using these products"
5.00,"This mouthwash doesn't burn and leaves your mouth feeling fresh...Husband loves and will buy again!"
1.00,"I tried this mouthwash for the first time and I will never use it again! It numbed my taste buds for days after I used it and I couldn't taste anything. It felt like my tongue had been scalded badly with hot soup or coffee. They need to pull this crap from the shelves. What a waste of $5+."
5.00,"I love that just from the dentist feeling, and now I get it every time I brush."
5.00,"Despite being advertised as a toothpaste for people 50 and older, the packaging provides little explanation of what exactly people over 50 need in a toothpaste that those in their 20s and 30s do not need. Comparing the active ingredients to Crest's regular toothpaste, 50+ has 0.454% stannous fluoride (0.16% w/v fluoride ion) vs. 0.243% sodium fluoride in the regular. From doing a little research it appears that stannous fluoride is more effective at preventing cavities, plaque, and gingivitis. Wouldn't everyone want the best possible toothpaste regardless of their age? Either way, Crest Pro-health seems to work well enough. The mint flavor is not overwhelming, and whether or not it is the result of the stannous fluoride, the toothpaste leaves your mouth feeling like you just came from the dentist -- that clean flavor."
4.00,"I liked the way the mouthwash tasted. There was no burning sensation either. I intend to continue using this product."
4.00,"i liked this product. it left my mouth feeling clean. like toothpaste should. its a little pricey."
5.00,"I've been lucky enough to have never had a cavity in my life. Unfortunately for the last several years I've spent a lot of time at the dentist due to issues with my gums receding. My dentist recommended this toothpaste about 6 months ago. I've been using it and I'm happy to report that the last dentist visit I had showed less recession than my previous visits. If you're familiar with gingivitis you know how uncomfortable it can be, this toothpaste definitely helps reverse the symptoms. Highly recommended."
4.00,"Nothing so good as a tall iced coffee on the patio on a warm spring morning! This is my social drink."
5.00,"Cleans teeth so well and leaves your mouth feeling clean!"
5.00,"I really liked this toothpaste. It gave a great feeling of cleanliness and freshness. With most other brands I've used in the past, the fresh feeling goes away very quickly. What I really liked was my mouth felt super fresh long after I brushed. I think at my next dental check up my mouth will be in better overall health!"
1.00,"My teeth have never had issues with discoloring and I get regular 6 month dental checkups. I was given a trial of Crest Pro Health Multi-purpose mouthwash to use after the last checkup. I recently started noticing patches of brownish gray staining on my front teeth and in the corners between the teeth. It's embarrassing and I researched to find out what could have caused this so quickly with no diet changes. Then I read that this product I started using is not only NOT making my smile better, but it is the reason for the staining. I'M NOT HAPPY CREST! Research your products better before releasing them to the public. Now I have to see the dentist again just to see if they can buff the stains off or see if I need some sort of bleaching to correct it."
1.00,"This toothpaste is horrible.  I got it because it was a whitening toothpaste and I fell into the \"pro-health\" marketing hype.  I saw the warning that it may stain teeth and thought that it was the same warning that sometimes comes on at home whitening systems (warning it may temporarily stain the gums white).                                                                     But after using this toothpaste for a few months, two of my front lower teeth turned brown in a very noticeable way.  It took me a bit to realize that it was the toothpaste, but I immediately stopped using it when I did.  The brown stains on the surface of my teeth, and forming in between a few, did not come off when I switched back to my regular toothpaste (or used at home whitening products).  It made me self-conscious to smile or talk.  Until one day I happened to buy a dental pick from the store that also came with a scraper.  I decided to see if the stains could be scrapped off.  Luckily they did come off and I was very relieved (I was considering professional whitening).                                                                     I do NOT recommend this toothpaste at all.  And I think it's a sick irony that Crest would dare put a \"whitening\" toothpaste on the market that turn teeth brown.  And Crest knows it does b/c they even put a warning on the box, though they don't mention your teeth will turn brown, and try to pretend that they've done something to guard against the potential for staining (how about taking this horrible toothpaste off the market?).  And apparently the Crest pro-health mouthwash has an even worse record for turning people's teeth brown (or causing them to loose their sense of taste).  Therefore I will also be pouring out the last of my pro-health mouthwash as well (it burned my mouth like regular mouthwash and caused me to lose my sense of taste or to have a metallic taste to foods).  I'm never buying Crest products again."
5.00,"I love how fresh my breath feels after I use this toothpaste! I will be buying this again!"
5.00,"I love this product. After using it your mouth feels cool and refreshed."
4.00,"I love to have my teeth feel like this after. It really made me notice how they can be abused during the day. Crest is always a household favorite."
5.00,"This new toothpaste fits the brand perfectly! The texture of some whitening toothpastes gets to me, but this was perfect. The flavor was not overwhelming and most importantly, it did the job!"
4.00,"I'll definitely buy this product in the future. My teeth felt great after using it. I am planning on trying the other products very soon."
4.00,"I use it and I have my teenagers using it, too, for extra insurance with braces and afterward."
4.00,"I didn't like the taste so much, but it did work. I don't really like the taste of mint and this was really strong. For mouthwash, though, it was better than average since it worked better than most."
5.00,"This is a good tasting toothpaste that helps to reduce plaque and to help stop it from coming back. Its formula protects against plaque, gingivitis, cavities and tooth sensitivity, while also whitening teeth and freshening breath."
5.00,"I have used this product for over a year now. It does a great job with cleaning and freshness. I recommend this to everyone!"
5.00,"This is a very good mouth rinse. Before I tried this one I was using Crest Pro-Health multi-protectio rinse, which was recommended by my dental hygenist. Their both good mouth rinses."
3.00,"I ordered a product called \"Night Mouthwash\".  The item I received looked very similar, but did not say \"Night\" anywhere on the bottle."
5.00,"I love this mouth wash it makes me feel so clean and fresh."
5.00,"I really loved this toothpaste. A good, fresh taste and long-lasting clean feeling!"
5.00,"Crest comes out with one Excellent product after another and Crest Pro-health For Life is another hit. This particular product is for people over 50. (Hello) As we get older our teeth need extra care and this toothpaste addresses those issues. Gingivitis, tartar and sensitivity are my problems but this toothpaste also addresses cavities, plaque, whitening and fresh breath. Even though I'm getting older, I still care about my smile - how it looks and feels. Taking care of our teeth is even more important as we age because mouth heath affects heart health. This Crest tastes fresh and my teeth feel like I just left the dentist office. The Great thing is, I can have the \"just left the dentist office feeling\" Every day : ) THUMBS UP!"
5.00,"We've been using Crest Pro-Health toothpaste for over a year now. I like the clean feeling I get from using it. My teeth feel really clean, like when I leave the dentist's office. And my dental appointments have been very good since I started using it!"
5.00,"This is a great product. I like the tast of it. It isn't overpowering and has a smooth texture to it. My teeth felt so clean after I used it."
5.00,"I have never used a Crest toothpaste product I didn`t like , and this one was no exception. I will continue to buy this and other Crest tooth paste products"
1.00,"YOU DO NOT WANT TO USE THIS RINSE! It will stain your teeth to kingdom come and take some doing in the dentist's chair to get rid of all the brown spots! Might be helpful for those who have major problems with decay, but otherwise there are better products out there and you should spare yourself the headaches and hassle."
4.00,"great rinse-didn't burn- made mouth and teeth feel clean"
3.00,"This is a decent mouthwash. It contains no alcohol. I happen to prefer a non-alcohol mouthwash. It does contain artificial color (Blue #1). I dislike that. I don't need pretty, artificial colors in foods or health goods, especially in a product marketed for \"people over 50.\"It feels strong in my mouth, but not overpowering. Some mouthwashes feel like they are weak/watered down. I do not notice any medicinal smell during or after use, something I do find in some mouthwash products. It is advertised as \"Smooth Mint.\" While the flavor itself is very mild, the mouthwash does create a very strong astringent effect, as if it instantly dried up all the moisture in my mouth. I didn't particularly care for that feeling.After use, my breath does seem to feel fresh/clean and it lasts for hours.I am not sure what the different is between this \"for people over 50\" product and usual mouthwash. In fact, I compared the ingredients for this product and the \"regular\" Crest Pro-Health. The active ingredient, cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC) at .07% is identical in both products. The Crest web-site says the product has been \"Selected for people over 50 because it is alcohol-free and provides a unique sensation.\"This appears to be simple marketing. I am not saying the product is ineffective, it seems to work. I just find that mouthwash makers seem to love to market their products as \"restoring\" or does this or that, or in this case \"for people 50 and over.\" Yet the products seem to be virtually the same.Over all, this is an OK mouthwash, however I am not sure I can get past the astringent feeling."
4.00,"My teeth felt clean and smooth when I used this toothpaste."
1.00,"I didn't use this product long enough to suffer any of the other consequences mentioned.  I googled simply because I was curious if others felt the way I did about this product.  It appears they do.  Beyond all the other potential problems it has, this toothpaste tastes so bad, I used it once and threw it away."
5.00,"I am really pleased with this toothpaste and I will continue using it for myself and my family."
4.00,"It kept my mouth feeling clean and fresh and helped keep my teeth whiter."
3.00,"Tried during a recent hotel stay and it was average at best. The product dissolve quickly and did not give the refreshing experience after teeth brushing."
5.00,"I love that I am not left with a terrible taste in my mouth after using this mouthwash. It is effective and I feel better knowing that my teeth are clean and protected each night when I go to bed."
5.00,"liked the refreshing flavor! Made my teeth and breath feel clean and fresh!"
4.00,"This product helped my breath feel fresher than the last kind of toothpaste I used."
4.00,"I truthfully did not care for the after taste..other than that, this rinse did a good job and left me smelling fresh..but i just did not care for the after taste. Sorry"
4.00,"I really liked this product! It always made my teeth feel clean and for longer periods throughout the day! Will definately be buying this product!"
4.00,"Wow, hysteria on Amazon! I'm used to the opposite! Many products on Amazon receive what I consider to be fraudulent reviews in favor of poor products but now I see it goes both ways!                                              Regarding this product: Anything that kills the crud growing on your teeth will leave the dead crud as a brownish film on your teeth. I have used other products that do the same thing. One is grape seed extract or GSE. When I first started rinsing with that it left my teeth brown! I did panic a bit but then found I could simply scrape the brown off. It's like a rock in a river with moss on it. The moss weakens the rock because of the roots but take the rock out of the water and in to the sun and the moss dies and turns dark but then can be easily scraped off leaving a more healthy rock or in this case a healthy tooth.                                              Another such product is MMS or sodium chlorite. When used properly to gargle in the mouth it kills everything.                                              I've used Crest Pro Health for a few days now with no problems and I feel like a few people panicked and are now blasting Amazon with negative reviews on this product. Crest Pro health is a good product!"
4.00,"I liked the way my teeth looked and felt after using this toothpaste! I feel like my teeth were whiter and I liked the taste."
4.00,"I have used Colgate for years, but decided to try this as I also got a new Oral B electric toothbrush. I love both! I have had trouble with excess foaming when using an electric toothbrush, but this was great. My mouth feels clean after brushing."
3.00,"The toothpaste tastes like Crest Complete but I didn't like the medicinal aftertaste. I think this is better for those with plaque issues. For now, I will stick with Crest 3D White."
4.00,"Loved how long the clean feeling lasted, although after about half an hour the 'after taste' from the mouth wash started to get a little funky."
5.00,"I loved the crest clinical strength mouthwash.Doen't burn your mouth plus keep it fresh for longer!!!"
5.00,"Great minty taste and my teeth felt very clean. Thumbs up!"
4.00,"Doesn't burn. My wife and I use daily and have no teeth browning. Don't know what others are complaining about!"
5.00,"Oh, I love this rinse, makes my mouth feel so fresh and germ free!"
4.00,"both my husband and I tried the crest prohealth with plaque control and it had a great taste and works wonderfully. we both will be using in the future"
2.00,"I was almost afraid to open the tube of Crest Pro-Health Clean Mint Toothpaste after reading the reviews here. I did though, and fortunately haven't experienced any of the side effects mentioned here. With that being said though, I really do not like this tootpaste. The first thing I do not like is the taste. The only way I can describe it is that it tastes \"unpleasant\", and the taste lingers. The toothpaste is also abrasive and like brushing with sand. I will not be using Crest Pro-Health Clean Mint Toothpaste again."
5.00,"Great. Improved my oral health from one visit to the next. Gets better as your health gets better. Try it."
5.00,"Love the taste, and the way my mouth feels afterwards -fresh and clean for a long time."
5.00,"loved it the rinse !!! my mouth feel so fresh and clean without that alcool feeling"
5.00,"We loved this product, it got our teeth and mouth feeling really clean and fresh, we use it all the time now."
4.00,"It goes on smooth. It's firm not sliding all over the toothbrush. It tastes good and leaves my mouth feeling clean without that medicine taste. All in all I don't what else to say except that I would buy this product and my dentist would be happy."
4.00,"Crest Pro-Health For Life Smooth Mint toothpaste is a product cleans my teeth while reducing the sensitivity I experience. I can't say whether it has made my teeth whiter or not but I feel like the toothpaste is doing its job and keeping my teeth clean. The flavor isn't my favorite but I'll get over it."
5.00,"I loved this product! It makes me feel clean every time I use it!"
5.00,"Made my teeth feel really clean, almost dentist-clean!"
5.00,"Really cleans and makes my teeth feel smooth and my mouth feel fresh"
5.00,"these were a good price, so i got them. this is the only kind of toothpaste we use now. We find it works great."
5.00,"This rinse works great, leaves your mouth feeling very clean..we love all the ProHealth products and this is a great addition!"
4.00,"This product made my teeth feel clean and my breath fresh."
5.00,"hae been using this for about a week now. it seems that our teeth are getting a little whiter. like all toothpaste it isn't going to happen overnite. i think with this product if one continues usage over time you teeth will become whiter and whiter"
4.00,"I really don't know why Crest needs to come up with a toothpaste directed at the 50+ crowd. I'm 60 and I had the same dental conditions I had when I was 40. The toothpaste has little to distinguish it from other Crest products, which I do like. I would prefer peppermint to spearmint, but it is not appreciably different from any of their multi-complete-whitening toothpastes. I would buy it and use it again, but would not pay a premium for it. I suspect the marketing of a new Crest toothpaste is more about filling shelf space and crowding out competitors than about offering a formula that does anything different."
5.00,"I loved this mouthrinse! It has nice fresh smell and taste, it's very gentle - doesn't burn your mouth when you rinse. It's antigingivitis/antiplaque - very important when you care about your dental hygiene and health."
5.00,"I absolutely loved the way my mouth felt after using this product. Fresh breath and my teeth felt like I had just left the dentist!"
5.00,"I gave a bottle to my Mom and she loves it! I like how fresh it leaves my mouth. Clean and fresh and alcohol free!"
5.00,"I loved the way my teeth felt and the fresh breath lasted. I higly recommend this product."
4.00,"The product tastes much better than I thought it might ... and it does so many good things for your teeth, gums, and mouth!"
4.00,"I really liked the new Crest Pro-Health Clinical toothpaste. It left my teeth feeling squeeky clean and fresh. Fresh feeling lasted throughout most of the day."
5.00,"I love the entire product line, they have helped with gums. I have my entire family using these now."
5.00,"I loved the fresh feeling in my mouth after using this toothpaste."
5.00,"My dentist recommended the wash. I use an oz every night before bed. It has a wonderful taste & it really works."
4.00,"I have always been a loyal Crest user, so I am always excited to try new products by them. I did enjoy the toothpaste, but it did not leave me with the overall \"Wow!\" clean feeling that I get from another Crest product line. If I had coupons and found this at a great deal, I may purchase it, but it would not regularly replace my current toothpaste."
1.00,"Wish I'd read about this before I bought it. I wanted a flouride rinse with no alcohol. For the first few days I noticed a weird aftertaste, but today is the worst so far. It's been over 12 hours since I used the rinse this morning and my tongue still has a metallic taste and burns a little bit. Can't find my receipt but I still might take it back to the store tomorrow and suggest they pull it from their shelves. Absolute crap. Glad it hasn't stained my teeth yet, as I've seen is the case for other users. How is this still on the market when complaints started rolling in in 2008???"
5.00,"Ive been using this since it came out and its my favorate toothpaste. a;ways keeps my teeth and mouth fresh and clean"
1.00,"Here I thought I was doing something so wonderful for my mouth and teeth and now I have brown stains in between teeth! Beware!"
5.00,"We love the Crest Pro Health tooth paste! I wouldnt let my family use anything diff!"
5.00,"This isn't a whitening tooth paste but it sure feels and looks great! I can't believe how much it works. All I can say is IT WORKS!"
5.00,"Sorry to see it going away. We've been using it for ages! Hope something else comes about when we've used up this recent purchase."
5.00,"What a blast of flavor. My breath smells great,fresh and clean, after using this for several hours. I wouldn't advise using it just before eating though or it's all you'll taste. Works fast and love the measuring cup cap. I've used it for just a week and have an area inside the bottom two front teeth that really seem to get plaque build up very quickly and this appears to be getting rid of some of that so I figure over time it will most likely get rid of that problem. That will be nice because the plaque in your teeth can give you bad breath and I'm in direct sales so that's a very bad thing. I did find it for less at WalMart though."
5.00,"I would certainly recommend this product to others. I'll be purchasing it again."
5.00,"liked this product as much as I do all Crest products."
4.00,"I love the crisp, clean taste and how it made my teeth feel really smooth and clean. Will definitely buy again."
5.00,"I loved this toothpaste. It did what it claims and left your mouth feeling fresh and clean and as perfect as when you leave the dentist's office. This is my new toothpaste of choice! It should be yours too! :)"
5.00,"I loved the Crest plaque rinse and the toothbrush as well. I have sensitive teeth and sometimes even rinses will bother my mouth, but this one didn't. It was a very pleasant taste and did not overwhelm my mouth with a strong odor or after- taste. It left my mouth feeling refreshed and clean and it lasted for hours. I would defenitely recommend this product to my friends and family."
5.00,"I like the way my mouth felt after using it. I was extremely impressed when my son used it. He had grinding dust enbedded into his teeth (little black specks) he used it last night and the specks dissappeared. I will keep using it."
5.00,"I absolutely loved this product. My mouth felt clean and fresh all day. I seen a difference in the color of my enamel and my gums brightened. The product works however, this would be a luxury item in my household."
4.00,"We are trying to instill good habits for the mouth with our son. Our son loves how his mouth feels after a visit to the dentist. Since we have started using the family of Crest products, he has stated that he loves how his mouth feels. Yea!"
5.00,"I guess the only thing I can attribute this to is crest products, their value and quality is excellent and these are no different!"
5.00,"I love all the Crest premium toothpastes, and this one is no exception. It leaves my mouth fresh and clean, with a great minty taste."
5.00,"oh what a feeling! wowza! My teeth feel like we've just come from the dental office - so smooth, such confidence in my smile. A pleasure to brush longer."
1.00,"I've been searching for a no burn mouthwash for adults, because basically every adult mouthwash either has a strong mint flavor (not my preference)or has alcohol. I also wanted to choose one that does more then kill germs, and this seemed like the perfect solution. Clean mint isn't overpowering as far as mint flavors go, but IT STILL BURNS! What is the point of putting \"no alcohol\" on the bottle? That only implies one thing, that it won't burn. This does, in fact, burn. Luckily I haven't experienced the brown spotting that others note, but that's probably because I can't stand a full 30 seconds with this stuff in my mouth. I wouldn't say I have a sensitive mouth or teeth either. If you're like me and seek a mouthwash that doesn't burn, just pass up the entire Crest Pro Health line. I guess it's back to ACT kids bubble gum flavor!"
5.00,"It does the job of whitening teeth quiet well without tasting like medicine."
4.00,"This rinse has good flavor. It makes my mouth feel clean!"
5.00,"Crest Pro-Health Whitening Fresh Clean Mint Toothpaste 7.8 Oz (Pack of 4).              Can you tell me what is the date of exp? Thank you!"
5.00,"Love this toothpaste. It made my mouth feel so clean and fresh. The only problem with it is that it made the inside of my mouth peel."
5.00,"As someone who struggles with bad breath, this product is a great help in keeping my mouth fresh feeling!"
4.00,"I really am satisfied with this product. It makes my mouth feel fresh and clean for hours."
5.00,"I really liked this toothpaste. I have problems with ssensitive teeth and have liked this toothpaste the best for my teeth. The texture of it is great and really makes me feel clean!"
5.00,"The toothpaste was pleasantly surprising. It was not too \"harsh\" feeling and the clean feeling really did last for a while after brushing."
4.00,"I really liked this product as it had a fresh and pleasant taste, unlike some of the other toothpastes. The taste and freshness lasted even after eating food."
5.00,"Enjoyed crest prohealth toothpaste,clean,fresh taste and mouth feels grrreat after use"
4.00,"If to mouth rinse with Crest before the bed, then there is no bad feeling in the mouth in the morning. I like it."
5.00,"Works great, will start to burn if you are not used to mouthwash at first. Teeth feel better and whiter almost instantly!"
5.00,"Crest is a great company and yet again proves that they offer high quality products! This mouth wash was unlike others in that it did not leave a terrible after taste and left my teeth feeling absolutely clean!"
2.00,"I was impressed with the mouth wash! My mouth felt so clean after."
1.00,"I bought this product not on Amazon but should have read the reviews first. I only used it for 2 days and almost didn't wake up on 1-20-14. I am very lucky that I did. I was gagging, my tongue was swelling and my throat was swollen out past my chin! I took a Benadryl and went to the ER. I am on Benadryl, Prednisone and have to carry an Epipen all from this mouthwash! I have seen my Allergist Doctor and tomorrow I see a Ear, Nose, Throat Doctor as I am still having issues. I have been a Crest user since I was a kid and this is the first time I tried the mouthwash and it TRIED TO KILL ME! Don't use this product. I have seen over 500 consumer complaints on the internet about this very thing since then. It is not just me that this is happening to. My bills are skyrocketing from this product. Update as of Jan 23rd. Saw a ENT Doctor today and I still have residual allergic reaction swelling. More predinsone and benedryl with a recheck next week. I haven't used this mouthwash since Sunday night and it's still causing issues! My doctor and I are reporting it to the FDA. If you have a reaction to this product please also report it to the FDA to get it off the shelves! Update as of Feb 10th. Still have jaw and tongue swelling and more medical bills. I just reported it to the Better Business Buerau. ***This product won't get off the shelves unless your report it to the FDA and the BBB online. It is very easy to do both. Just doing a review like this won't get it off the market. Please do the reports****"
4.00,"I loved the feel of the toothpaste, the taste wasn't bad either! My teeth felt clean and I didnt feel I had to brush them again after I had my coffee, like I do with other toothpaste!"
5.00,"Love it, works great your teeth feel like you been to dentist."
5.00,"My son loves to brush his teeth with his Jake toothbrush and toothpaste, he calls it \"his paste\", which makes us both very happy."
4.00,"Love the Crest products! I am not usually fond of mouthwash, but I like the that this one fights plaque and gingivitis both!"
4.00,"It left my mouth feeling clean and fresh even hours after I brushed! I really liked that."
5.00,"My teeth felt super clean after using this product. By the time I got half way through the tube I had noticed a big difference in how my teeth felt. I have to be careful though...something in the toothpaste makes my teeth a little sensitive so I'm alternating between Crest and a toothpaste designed for sensitive teeth."
4.00,"My breath smelled great for hours and my mouth felt clean for a long time after using."
5.00,"Very good product"
5.00,"Great toothpaste from a brand I trust. Would definitely purchase again!"
4.00,"My family and I are very excited about this new product from Crest.We have tried other sensitive toothpastes and most are just fine for the price and value. What is so different about Crest Pro-Health toothpaste is it works it really really works! It takes care of those sensitive spots that so many of us have, it's gentle and it leaves your teeth feeling like you just left the dentist's office. If you want to try one new product this year treat your teeth and your smile to this new product."
1.00,"I initially bought Crest Pro-Health for my husband in December 2007. A few weeks after, he began to experience a rash and itching on his legs and arms. We didn't link it to the change in toothpaste, not realizing that a product as common as toothpaste could cause a rash elsewhere on your body. Therefore, he had continued to use this toothpaste, with the rash persisting, until recently. In July of 2008, I bought the same toothpaste for my teenage daughter. A few weeks after, she also began to experience a rash and itching on her legs and arms. After consulting the doctor and reviewing any recent changes that may be causing this rash, Crest Pro-Health was the only change that occurred. A couple of days after discontinuing use of this toothpaste, the intensity of their rashes has lessened greatly. Apparently they are allergic to the stannous fluoride (versus sodium fluoride which is found in regular Crest). This is not a common allergy, but nonetheless, should be considered if someone is experiencing a rash. I will not be buying this product again, nor will I buy any other products with stannous flouride."
5.00,"Love this product. My mouth feels really clean afterwards!!"
4.00,"I love this toothpaster, Its awesome, and great especially if you have sensitive teeth, they have a line geared to that!"
5.00,"This is the most innovative mouthwash I haev ever tried! I love that it foams up in my mouth, making me feel as if my teeth are getting extremely clean. My mouth tastes really fresh afterward, and remains that way for a long time. I will definitely buy this product again!"
3.00,"Crest Pro-Health Smooth Mint Mouth Rinse falls into the category of refreshing, alcohol-free mouth washes. It has a pleasant minty flavor.The active ingredient is 0.07% cetylpyridinium chloride, a quaternary ammonium cation antiseptic. Research has shown that it has a small beneficial effect in treating gingivitis and preventing plaque and it is generally regarded as safe when used for short periods of time. However, I do not think that using antibiotic agents on or in the body on a regular basis in the absence of an infection is a good practice because it interferes with normal, helpful bacteria and can cause health problems. Oral microbiology in particular is complex and disturbing the natural balance of microorganisms could cause harmful species to proliferate.I also prefer a stronger, more astringent mouthwash with fluoride.So while I would recommend this mouthwash for people with gingivitis, I wouldn't recommend it for everyday use for people with healthy teeth and gums."
4.00,"This toothpaste made my teeth feel very clean and my mouth feel very fresh. I will buy it again. My 14 yr. old loved it!"
1.00,"I tried the Crest Pro health and within a day I started feeling the tip of my tongue swelling and getting sore. I could see the taste buds all red and raised. Its been a week now and I realized that it is because of this toothpaste. I can hardly eat anything as my tongue is so sore. I have stopped using it and hope to get better in a few days. Will never buy Crest products again."
5.00,"very nice product! Teeth felt so amazing...would definately buy & recommend this toothpaste! ;)"
5.00,"Hey, just wanted to let you all know that I have been using crest pro health mouthwash now for years. I needed a mouthwash to help with mild gingivitis and I can't stand Listerine. Since I started using it I haven't had any gingivitis and my teeth have been in excellent shape. The idea that this mouthwash could \"leave\" stains is ludicrous. I feel like this product has been falsely targeted for negative reviews. I wouldn't advise ordering something like this online, but I pick up a new bottle at target every couple months. My only complaint is that lately I haven't been able to find the clear kind, but the blue kind is just about as good. As a side note, I looked into their FDA submission and they had to do extensive testing on this due to how it is marketed. I would trust any bottle with the seal in tact that you purchased from a reputable store. Sounds like you all have been getting repackaged turpentine from Asia... : ("
5.00,"Only toothpaste I will use from now on. It makes my teeth feel really clean and helps with sensitivity and other issues like sensitive gums all in one toothpaste. Highly recommended."
4.00,"This toothpaste left my teeth feeling clean. It did a great job removing the plaque."
5.00,"I personally use biotene as I have very dry mouth, but my grandson prefers the pro health than the regular ones. My grandson did not like brushing his teeth,but since I gave him the pro health, he likes brushing as he says he likes the taste and his mouth feels good."
5.00,"I love this toothpaste. It's awesome. My teeth not only feel really clean but they feel smooth as well. I will definitely buy this in the future."
5.00,"I loved it, my teeth and mouth felt fresh and cleen and feeling lasted. teeth look brighter in just days!"
4.00,"This product is a nice cross between scope and listerine. It provides a clean and fresh rinse but does not burn in the process. I think this is a product I would purchase in the future."
4.00,"Smooth clean teeth, and long lasting fresh breath. Great product."
5.00,"Was a great tasting toothpaste that made my mouth feel refreshed and clean."
3.00,"When I bought this toothpaste, I had high expectations from the claims it had on the box. After I used it a few times, I realized that this was just another toothpaste. I did not notice anything different with the way my teeth felt. I did like the flavor though!"
1.00,"Tried Crest Pro Health Toothpaste. Seems OK as you're brushing but when you're done, it tastes like you just ate bad cheese. No fresh feeling like a good mint toothpaste. I ended up throwing what tubes we had in the trash and going out to buy regular Crest with Scope -- much better! This stuff is awful -- don't waste your money!"
5.00,"It feels like I just left the dentist every morning!"
3.00,"It was okay but I felt that it was expensive compared to similar products."
5.00,"This toothpaste makes your teeth feel extremely clean and also my gums felt nice after using this product. The clean feeling also seemed to last longer than usual toothpaste products."
1.00,"Crest pro health complete mouthwash claims to be \"6 benefits in 1\". Well, one of those \"benefits\" is the no burn of alcohol. This isn't really a benefit, because it isn't something adding to your dental care. So it's more like 5 benefits in 1. It also stains your teeth. Why risk teeth staining just to maintain a healthy mouth? Listerine Total Care is very similar, and it atleast has 6 benefits in 1, and won't stain teeth."
5.00,"I started using the Crest Clinical Plaque control toothpaste two weeks prior to my cleaning. I always got the \"You need to pay attention to your gums & floss more\" speech. But, as a mom of three boys, I'm lucky if I flosss 4 nights a week! But, after using Crest - I got a \"Your gumline looks great!\" I highly recommend this! Great product & the flavoring is better than most!"
1.00,"I guess it was my fault for odering these without checking the whole ad. I took it for granted that they were 7.8 oz. like the ones I had received in the past. Anyway, my son pointed out to me that these were basically the size that he receives as samples from his dentist so I went ahead and cancelled the order. Funny thing, within minutes of cancellation, the order was shipped already. I did not accept it when it arrived in the mail but wrote to Amazon and they gave me full refund, including postage. This complaint is not against the toothpaste but the seller who actually has the nerve to charge this price for mere samples. The toothpaste is excellent and we've been using it in the past, as recommended by our dentist. Luckily, I found the size I wanted on Amazon a little later and ordered it, of course - at a very reasonable price. Moral - read the advertising and pay attention to every detail. Amazon, I believe, has no control over the prices that the sellers set. So it's up to us, the buyers, to decide if we're getting ripped off or a fair deal. But as always, Amazon is willing to make good (even where our mistakes are concerned). It's one of the reasons why it's still my favorite \"Market Place\"."
5.00,"Was very happy with the toothpaste. Felt my teeth were very clean after using it."
4.00,"I enjoyed how it made my teeth feel.. but it was a little more then I like to spend on toothpaste."
5.00,"Works great, good tasting, cleans well, whitens teeth and freshens breath. Good size and value, will last you months and months."
5.00,"I love just about all the toothpastes in the Crest lineup, and the Crest Pro-Health Clinical Plaque Control is no exception. It has a pleasant, non-antiseptic taste, and leaves my mouth and teeth feeling refreshed and clean. After using for about a month, I do not notice any change in the sensitivity of my teeth, however, my teeth are very sensitive, so I suspect it'll take something stronger to help in that area. That being said, I still rate this five stars because it does a great job at making my mouth and teeth feel very clean."
5.00,"This new Crest toothpaste left my mouth feeling clean and fresh!"
5.00,"I really liked this toothpaste. My mouth feels good and clean."
5.00,"This is really good toothpaste! I would recommend it to anyone! After brushing my teeth with this toothpaste, I felt like I just came from getting a cleaning from the dentist office!!"
3.00,"This mouth wash was good. I didnt like the taste tho and its A little pricey."
1.00,"On the plus side, no alcohol, so it's easier to rinse for the recommended period of time. But when I looked in the mirror this morning, I noticed my teeth were a light shade of brown along the gumline. Had recently started using Crest mouthwash, so on a whim I googled it, and low and behold I was not imagining it. My fiance had also complained that his sense of taste was off after using it, but I thought he was imagining it. Guess I owe him an apology."
5.00,"I love this toothpaste and it's accompanying mouth wash product. I have never experienced anything remotely like some of the other reviewers (red stains or film inside mouth). I saw an immediate improvement in my gums after using this toothpaste. The mouth wash keeps your mouth feeling fresh for hours, which is something many others have only claimed, but I never experienced. I highly recommend this toothpaste and I don't foresee myself ever switching brands again."
1.00,"I've been using ACT for several years and thought I'd give this stuff a try. Boy, do I wish I'd read the reviews on this page first. I used it this morning and I've had a bitter taste in my mouth all day. Worse, anything I eat or drink has that same bitter taste. My tongue feels like it's been burned, like cheese burn from a really hot pizza.Avoid this stuff. It's horrible."
1.00,"I should have checked reviews on Amazon before buying this at the store. It BURNED my tongue! I couldn't taste food all day because of it! WORST mouthwash I have ever experienced. There should be a RECALL for safety hazard."
4.00,"It was a good mouthwash, a little expensive but it left your mouth feeling clean"
5.00,"This is a wonderful product. I enjoyed using it so much I had my kids try it out. They liked it too. I will be switching brands."
5.00,"I liked the clean feel I had after brushing and it lasted throughout the night without me waking up to a fuzzy mouth. I also like that the taste wasn't so overpowering and didn't burn the way some toothpastes do. Even my oldest son tried it and said he liked it which is unusual."
4.00,"This didn't work any better than other toothpastes I've used in the past. Did have a nice flavor, and left my mouth feeling fresh."
1.00,"Finished a bottle of this before starting to worry that there was something horribly wrong with me or my dental hygiene habits due to the staining on my teeth that was so bad multiple people noticed and told me to see a dentist right away. It took my a while to figure out that this was causing it, because mouthwash is probably the last thing you would expect to stain your teeth. The fact that these people sell oral hygiene products that STAIN YOUR TEETH is absolutely absurd and reprehensible.                                                                     Never buy this product unless you want your teeth to look like they're rotting. This is literally the worst product I've ever used in my life. It does exactly what it's designed not to do. I'm definitely never buying Crest products again and will probably try to avoid P&amp;G all together just on the principle."
5.00,"I loved the way it made my mouth feel, and my teeth were so clean. Love the product."
4.00,"The toothpaste was fine. It wasn't my favorite, the flavor was a little week and the residue that was left on my teeth was a little bit annoying. I'd buy it again if the price was right."
4.00,"It left my mouth feeling clean and my teeth shiny white!"
5.00,"So I had a problem with Tartar and Plaque. I don't love flossing, although it can be satisfying. I picked this up instead of the Aquafresh crap I was using before. Dentist used to rag on me about weak gums and plaque build up. Last checkup, no complaints. Takes care of my gums, destroys plaque. Awesome."
1.00,"I have to say the 1 star reviews for this product are accurate; a family member of mine experienced all the terrible things mentioned in other reviews. According to our doctor, this product caused her to loose all the good bacteria in her mouth and encouraged yeast/thrush. Now she's completely lost her sense of taste and there're white/dry spots all over in her mouth. Please beware, don't ever use this thing. The toothpaste contains the same active ingredient (CPC); stay away from that one, too."
5.00,"After so many bad reviews, I asked my dentist about this before using.  He told me that there are problems for some people, if those people are not cleaning their teeth properly and have a plaque or bacteria issue.  This toothpaste, more or less, agitates this, which may make your mouth appear worse before better.  If that happens, a simple dental cleaning will solve things for you.                                                                     With that said, most people won't have any issues.  I certainly didn't.  This product worked great for me."
5.00,"For a cleaner mouth this product is great!"
5.00,"I have sensitive gums and teeth and like this product because there is no burning or strong taste from it. You can use it up to 2x's a day and it provides multi-protection from germs, plaque and bad breath. I use it with toothpaste for sensitive gums and teeth. The active ingredient is Cetylpyridinium chloride, .07%. Probably only chemists know what that is? But I do know that it is soothing on my gums and doesn't burn my tongue or cause any tooth pain when I use it like alcohol based mouthwashes do. My only complaint is that it has a bit of too sweet taste from artificial sweeteners that seems to linger after you've used it. It does say that it provides 24hr protection but not sure how that works unless you go without eating or drinking for 24hrs? But I do think it is an excellent product and will be buying and using it regularly since it appears to ease any gum problems I have."
5.00,"I wanted to use all the other toothpaste up first, so waited a little before I purchased it, and it was worth the wait. It cleans well and leaves a great feeling on your teeth and gums. Can't wait to see how shiny and white my teeth look after 2 weeks or so. I am happy with how they look only after 1 week."
4.00,"I like Crest's products, but usually find that the \"fresh\" feel/taste doesn't last long- this toothpaste cleans and freshens all day!"
3.00,"Although I think it's a good product, I didn't care for the taste compared to other mouthwashes."
4.00,"I have always liked crest and these new products are in line with the brand. The mouthwash is not too strong yet it still leaves a good clean feeling. The new toothbrush is a bit different looking but is flexible because of it. I specifically like the toothpaste because of the taste and how clean it leaves my teeth. The floss is by far the best on the market. The glide brand does a great job of flossing without getting stuck as much as a thicker waxy floss. Good solid products."
5.00,"Last week I had my bi-annual check-up. My dental hygienist was very happy with me. :)"
4.00,"I love how this toothpaste left my teeth feeling so clean and fresh. Very good product and I would buy it again."
5.00,"I love this stuff--it makes your teeth really slick and white and I noticed decreased sensitivity after just two days. Nice flavor and just a good clean feeling."
5.00,"I absolutly love this product.. It gets you teeth so clean and it is a clean that lasts."
1.00,"It will turn your teeth brown. If you keep using it, your teeth will turn black. Not much more to say than that."
1.00,"I spend a lot of money on my teeth. Dentists, endodontists, oral surgeon, you name it, I've had it done to my teeth. I've spent a fortune on them and a lot, LOT of time at these specialists. I have my teeth cleaned twice a year and I brush twice a day and floss every day. I decided a couple of months ago to add mouthwash to the routine. Since my husband had bought a Crest ProHealth a while back, just figured I'd use that up before buying Listerine (which I've read is the best). Within a month or so of using it daily, I now have brown stains all over my lower teeth!!! I was so freaked out! I used to drink 1/2 a cup of coffee a day, but I even stopped that about 2 months ago, in order to be healthier. I drink nothing but water and club soda, so they cannot blame the teeth stains on my drinks. After looking online and seeing all the complaints about this product, it boggles my mind that this product is still on the shelves!! Come on P&G, do the right thing and get rid of it already!"
5.00,"Crest has done it again! I love the way this toothpaste keeps my teeth feeling clean all day"
1.00,"It says to use 2x a day, but anymore than once every couple of days and my taste buds are killed off as if i've just eaten a whole package of sour patch kids. What kind of mouthwash does that? Don't waste your money on this mouthwash. I now only use it once in a while just so I can avoid ruining my tongue."
4.00,"The mouthwash made my mouth feel fresh and clean. The taste is pleasant also."
4.00,"When it comes to oral hygiene, I have gone through many products. For Crest products, the Pro-Health line uses a Polyfluorite System consisting of therapeutic antibacterial fluoride and ActivClean Crystals for cleaning. With the \"Crest Pro-Health Collection Kit\", you are getting the following products: * Oral-B Pro-Health All-in-One with Cross Action Bristles (Medium) - This is probably one of the best non-mechanical tooth brushes I have used. I have gone through many brushes and usually don't find a great fit, but this tooth brush was so comfortable to use, great grip and great clean! Awesome tooth brush... BUT with that being said, it's only offered with a medium toothbrush and for those who need something smaller or bigger, the inclusion of only a medium toothbrush may be this kit's caveat for one deciding if they should purchase it or not. * Crest Pro-Health Toothpaste - Minty Fresh toothbrush that fights cavities, plaque, gingivitis, builds protection against painful sensitivity, fights tarter, whitens teeth by removing surface stains and freshens breath. I love the aftertaste of this toothbrush and it made me feel that the toothpaste really does a thorough job on your teeth, even after a touch of water, it worked perfectly. * Crest Pro-Health Multi-Protection Rinse - You get a 1 Liter bottle of Crest's Pro-Health Multi-Protection Rinse. No strong aftertaste, no burning of the tongue. Makes you feel that you have fresh breath and it's great protecting for your teeth. * Oral-B Glide Pro-Health Deep Clean Floss - This is the tape version, not the string type that shreds and can get stuck in your teeth. The Pro-Health Deep Clean Floss has up to 90% more micro textured surface area than the Glide Original. Helps prevent gingivitis and provides a cool blast of clean feeling everytime you floss. JUDGMENT CALL: For the four products included the Crest Pro-Health Collection Kit, for my experience it's fantastic! But the reason why I can't give it a perfect five-star rating is because the tooth brush may not be perfect for others mouths. The medium that came with the kit worked perfectly but what if someone needed a toothbrush that was smaller or larger. This is where it would be much better if people had the option to change the size of the toothbrush for the kit. I'm also not too sure what price this kit is set at (at the time of my review, there is no price listed). But hopefully this kit is not overpriced. Overall, for my experience, the four products are fantastic! The floss works great, no shredding (I can't stand shredding floss), the toothpaste is not too watery and feels like it is really cleaning your teeth, the rinse is not too powerful or feel as if it is burning your tongue and the toothbrush, one of the best toothbrushes I have used. Crest Pro-Health products are fantastic but this kit will come down to those who use a medium toothbrush and if the price is just right. 4 Stars!"
4.00,"Left a great, clean feeling in my mouth after using it."
3.00,"I bought two different pro health toothpastes. My husband hates both of them. I just used the sensitive one. It was alright. It cleaned well enough, but didn't give my breath a really fresh scent that I like to have after brushing teeth."
5.00,"I used to try many different mouthwash but I Lways felt I had to rinse twice now with this crest I only use a very small amount and it leaves my mouth feel cleaner."
5.00,"I LOVED this toothpaste! My teeth felt soooo clean and my mouth felt great after using it! My family thought it was great as well; a family favorite! Crest Pro Health ROCKS!"
5.00,"Great mouthwash. You can fee the clean, without the burn. All gain no pain with this one! I love it!"
1.00,"I bought this toothpaste for all the stated benefits, and they did work as advertised. Unfortunately, this toothpaste will also cause the inside of your mouth to peel, leaving you with a gummy white substance to clear out of your mouth. I doubt any toothpaste is supposed to make your skin peel away and it be healthy. I will not be using this product ever again and will be following up with my dentist about the skin peeling issue."
4.00,"Most toothpastes like this do not taste good and do not leave my mouth fresh. I felt like it worked well at cleaning and freshening breath. I like that it did not have a whitening ingredient. I have sensitive teeth and it is very difficult to find a toothpaste like this that does not whiten."
5.00,"It was like I had just left the dentist. The best toothbrush ever."
4.00,"Made my mouth and teeth feel so clean. It lasted longer than most toothpastes I have used in the past."
5.00,"Cleans teeth well and whitens! Good value for the money"
1.00,"My girlfriend and I switched to Crest Pro Health Sensitive + Enamel Shield toothpaste about 3 months ago. I immediately noticed that my lips were chapping more but I thought it was just because with summer here, I was getting dehydrated. Then, when the inside of my cheeks started shredding and peeling CONSTANTLY, I mentioned it to my girlfriend and was amazed when she told me her cheeks and the roof of her mouth were doing the same thing. A little research and I found out the same thing everyone here is complaining about, it's CREST PRO HEALTH TOOTHPASTE that was causing it. We switched to another brand and the problem INSTANTLY went away. Do yourself a favor, like I did. It took me less than a minute researching this online to find hundreds of complaints about the toothpaste doing to all those people exactly the same thing it did to my girlfriend and me. Do you really want to use a toothpaste that destroys the skin in your mouth? I was waking up in the morning with a wad of dead skin in my mouth like it was stick of gum I was chewing! It was disgusting!"
2.00,"I have used Crest products for as long as I can remember. With age and what my dentist calls “overly rambunctious” brushing I needed to switch to a sensitive style of tooth paste. Having always been happy with Crest products I tried Crest Sensitive Shield, Smooth Mint. I am less that enamored with this product. I could deal with the horrible taste, but my mouth/teeth do not feel clean, much less fresh after use. Product packaging is an engineering miss. To close the cumbersome snap on cap you need to hold the tube fairly firmly which dispenses product to the underside of the cap, creating a constant mess. I’m sorry but Sensitive Shield Smooth Mint is a huge miss in my book."
5.00,"My entire family uses this rinse and it's become a part of our brushing routine."
3.00,"I really wanted the gel cinnamon crest. I didn't realize they made it in a paste. My mistake and the toothpaste is OK."
4.00,"Love the taste, not too over powering. It's my new favorite mouthwash"
5.00,"and my teeth look and feel better! Dentist encouraged me to keep using it."
4.00,"I really liked how clean my teeth feel after using this product. Plus, it tastes great!"
5.00,"I have tried many different types of toothpastes and this one by far is the best. My teeth never felt so clean."
5.00,"I love crest products and like the way it feels. i wish the prices of the products were cheaper."
4.00,"Loved this mouth wash it left my mouth feeling fresh and clean. Would buy it again."
1.00,"I read many good reviews about this products and some says the complaints against this one is not true. Well, I have to say that each one is different. You're not experiencing the side effects from this toothpaste doesn't mean we (who complaints) are liars. We just want to warn other peoples so by chance they can avoid the problem that we have. I am pregnant and got gum disease. Just a little swollen on 2 places. I used some salty water to wash my mouth 3 times a day and it really helps. So I wanted to buy some toothpaste that's good for gum too. Some people recommended this Crest PRo-health Gum PRotection so I bought it, hoping it would help. I only used it twice, one time before I went to bed and one time for the next morning. Actually when I checked my mouth before brushing my teeth that morning, I found a lot of mucus like substance in my mouth. IT's disgusting. Had to spend half an hour to take it all out of my mouth. By that time I didn't think the toothpaste caused trouble so I continued brushing my teeth again with the HORRIBLE toothpaste. Immediately when done, I found that my mouth became so dry, especially under the tongue, inner lips and cheeks. And 1hr later, mucus like substance was formed again. Look like i covered my teeth & gum with gummy film. So I did some research and found tons of complaints against this toothpaste. I said Fine, I would throw it away and go back to my old toothpaste. But seemed like my mouth now is paying a good price on trying this thing just twice. 1- Very dry mouth even after stop using Crest Pro-health Gum Protection 2- More gum problems. The salty water almost put away my gum trouble but this thing stripped my gum, made it bloody red and swollen between the teeths. As I said I just got little swollen on 2 places but now almost the gum between my teeths are swollen, rised higher than usual just like I got the advance periodontal disease. 3- mucus like substance still keeps forming but less than when I use that toothpaste. I hope it would be gone in a few days as this is just the first day I stop using the product. 4- Bleeding gum anytime. Before using this, I just got bleeding gum when brushing my teeth so hard. So never use it again."
5.00,"I was a little sketchy trying this mouthwash because I don't like any mouthwashes. Most of them leave a yucky taste afterwards but this one was good, it left the fresh feeling but not an ugly aftertaste. I would definitely buy it."
1.00,"So ithought it was a awesome mouth wash until i just decided to look it up online an just happen to click on the reviews because it had such low reviews an I was like mmh that's weird, so I start reading the reviews an now it's too late my tongue kinda burns an ihave a metallic taste in my mouth awesome..my advice throw it out or get a refund. Idk what to say other than wow.."
3.00,"I liked the taste and consistency but my teeth didn't feel as smooth as I would have liked. I think this toothpaste is above average compared to the other brands available on the store shelves, though."
5.00,"I love the feel of my theeth after using this product. I don't know if I can go back to any other toothpaste."
2.00,"First, I like the floss. This is the floss I always use. It glides well and does not shred. I buy it in bulk package from Costco. I do not like other items in the kit. Both the toothpaste and the rinse have a warning saying that they may cause teeth staining. What is up with that?! I have been using them for two weeks and I am constantly worried about staining. After brushing, I now spend time to examine my teeth to see if they became stained. So far, I don't think they did, but if I see a stain I will blame these products simply because of the warning. Staining of teeth is not something people should worry about when brushing their teeth. Incidentally, SmartMouth rinse states that it will not stain teeth or dentures. I do not want to be concerned with teeth staining when using tooth care products, so I will look for products that do not contain a possibility to cause staining. I have sensitive teeth, so I normally use Sensodine toothpaste which was recommended by every dentist I have seen. Crest Pro-Care toothpaste has never been recommended to me by a dentist, although it claims to help with hyper-sensitivity. I did not notice Crest helping with sensitivity better than Sensodine. According to dentists I visited, teeth sensitivity is a result of tooth enamel erosion. My dentists always recommended SOFT bristled brushes to reduce erosion. The toothbrush included in this kit has MEDIUM bristles, which may promote erosion of the enamel. Crest might have included medium toothbrush to combat the potential staining, but this is just my guess. I do not think that this is a good collection of products because of the potential teeth staining by the toothpaste and the rinse, and because the toothbrush has medium bristles which may promote enamel erosion and increase sensitivity. Additionally, items in this kit will likely run out at different times, so consumers are unlikely to purchase this as a kit more than once. At the time of this review the price is not available, so I cannot comment on value, but I do not see why one would be more interested in buying these products as a kit than individually."
4.00,"I recommend this product because it gives you a nice, clean feeling after you use it. Everyone in my family liked it!"
2.00,"I was excited to try this mouthwash because it is alcohol free, and I used it for a few days with great results as far as a long lasting fresh taste in my mouth, no burning during use, and really clean feeling teeth and gums. I am pregnant and am having inflamed gums due to pregnancy, and this seemed to be helping. However, after 3 days, I developed a feeling that I had just burned my tongue on something really hot and I lost my ability to taste anything. The only thing different was the use of this mouthwash, and when I googled to see if that was a side effect others have suffered, I saw it was pretty widespread! So, I have stopped using it, and it has been two days so far. I still cannot taste anything, but the burning feeling is getting better. The positives of this mouthwash could not outweigh the loss of ability to taste my food, so it is going in the garbage :("
5.00,"My teeth really looked whiter after using this toothpaste. I thought the flavor was good - not to sweet. There is a bit of a \"grit\" to the toothpaste, but it made me feel like my teeth were getting cleaned at the dentist office."
4.00,"I like the gritty texture of this toothpaste. But there are now so many line extensions I get confused. There's whitening, tartar control, and various similar flavors. I can't keep track."
5.00,"Crest has been my only brand for years and i thought it could not get better,but it did,,,Pro-Health toothpaste keeps my teeth clean,white and a just brush feeling for hours...thanx,Crest!"
4.00,"I love this toothpaste. Teeth felt so smooth and clean!"
5.00,"My husband and I just love this product, better even than the regualr crest mouthwash. I is refreshing and lasts."
4.00,"nice flavor, kept my mouth feeling fresh all day long."
3.00,"It is a good product, I just had a hard time with the taste, it tasted very medicine like to me."
4.00,"It really cleans your teeth well and leaves your mouth refreshed. More expensive than other toothpastes, but my teeth are worth it."
4.00,"Very clean feeling after use. Went to the dentist yesterday for cleaning and I was in and out within 30 minutes with next to no plaque build up!"
4.00,"The toothpaste makes your teeth feel clean and refreshed and ready to show off your smile. Depending on the store where the toothpaste is purchased determines the price but overall a very good value for the money"
5.00,"I have used Crest Pro-Health tooth paste and mouth wash for years and I love it. I will not buy anything else. I have never, ever had any staining of my teeth from this product. I have never had my dentist tell me that I have stains, in fact my dentist tells me I have very white teeth (and no I do not whiten my teeth!) I am not sure where the other reviewers are getting these stains from. Perhaps the gallons of coffee, pop/soda, or wine Americans drink in a year. I guess each person has their own results."
3.00,"We have purchased numerous brands of toothpaste over the years, including Colgate, Crest and several others. We used this recently and found this one to be a bit too gritty, almost like an exfoliant, which was a bit too 'pasty' in our mouths. The flavor itself is not bad, but the consistency was a bit irritating. In comparison to other Crest toothpaste product, which also seem more 'sandy' than Colgate for instance, this one was just too gritty for our liking."
5.00,"I really like the feel of my teeth and my mouth overall after I use the Crest Pro-Health Clinical toothpaste. My teeth feel as if they were just polished and the mint flavor is lasting but not overpowering."
4.00,"this product was great it really left my teeth feeling great just after a dentist visit! would deffinately buy again"
5.00,"I love the clean fresh feel in my mouth, great value too!"
5.00,"I love this product this in my favorite toothpaste"
5.00,"Using the Crest products has been a delight to my mouth! They do what they said they would & I plan to continue using them. Thanks, Crest."
5.00,"I loved this rinse. It left my mouth fresh without burning. There is a slightly different \"slippery\" feeling, but nothing bothersome."
4.00,"Love the mouthwash because it does not have that harsh alcohol burn like some do. It is minty and keeps your mouth clean and fresh."
5.00,"I really like this mouthwash! It doesn't burn like typical alcohol-containing mouthwashes, and it makes my mouth feel fresh and clean! Highly recommend!"
1.00,"It doesn't make a difference whether you use the flip-top cap or unscrew the cap, this toothpaste makes a mess! It's gloppy, stringy and horrible. I don't know if Crest decided to use some cheap fillers, such as guar gum, but whatever they did to this toothpaste, it's definitely not worth using. In addition, I saw no difference in my teeth or gums after using this for weeks. It's a terrible product; I'm going back to regular toothpaste. Crest should be ashamed of themselves."
5.00,"My teeth felt clean throughout the whole day! I love this toothpaste!"
5.00,"I, for one, love the new tube design! I have not had any problems with the toothpaste running out of the tube. I like that the lid is an attached flip lid and that I can stand the tube upright. Please don't change it! Oh, and I love the toothpaste also! I have noticed an improvement. Now I need to see what my dentist thinks. Thanks!!"
5.00,"this is a little more runny than other toothpaste so you have to be sure to close the cap tightly. I love how this makes my teeth feel and the flavor is also quite wonderful."
5.00,"I tried the clinical mouthwash and I love it! I like the tingle (not burn) that I felt when using it - not to mention that it kept my mouth feeling fresh for hours. Well worth the cost in my opinion. I will be using again for sure!"
5.00,"This product is great. My teeth feel wonderful. I would definitely purchased it again and I would recommend it to others."
4.00,"The toothpaste made my teeth feel squeaky clean!! very refreshing too!!"
4.00,"I haven't been to the dentist since I started using the new toothpaste - but I am sure there will be a difference. My mouth feels cleaners and my teeth don't feel \"fuzzy\" from plaque."
5.00,"This product worked very well at removing plaque and giving me fresh breath so it has already been added to my monthly shopping list. I would suggest this specific toothpaste to anyone who wants great smelling breath at an affordable price because it really does improve your hygiene."
5.00,"The Crest Pro-Health toothpaste and rinse are what I use and I won't be switching brands anytime soon! These seem to get my mouth the cleanest and freshest for the longest period of time! I definetly recommend giving these a try!!"
5.00,"I absolutely loved this product it really worked. My husband also tried it and was very happy with it."
5.00,"Well I think many toothpastes are good for you and always getting better so why this one stands out if it tastes amazing! It is a bit pricey at almost $5 for small tube but I can't find locally very often so I'm buying in bulk here on amazon."
5.00,"Been using this toothpaste for almost a year now. I absolutely love the taste and the clean feeling. Good stuff!"
3.00,"I thought I ordered the clear liquid, not the blue. The clear has been discontinued and amazon is sneaky in the footnotes that they may alter which one they send you. P&G is changing the clear liquid version to a different assortment and more expensive, and the color can stain plaque on the teeth, so brush carefully."
5.00,"I tried this mouthwash and was surprised by the pleasant flavor. It also left my mouth feeling incredibly clean and fresh."
5.00,"This toothpaste left a fresh, clean taste and feel that lasted for a long time."
5.00,"It has great flavor and works great. I love the flip top - it's a minor but important feature!"
4.00,"I really like this mouthwash, it kept my breath fresh throughout the day"
5.00,"This made my mouth feel so clean that that night I had a dream that Brad Pitt kissed me and my mouth was super fresh!"
1.00,"Our household is normally a Listerine household. The spouse loves it, but it burns so bad for me! I love the clean feeling of mouthwash, but have not always been faithful with my daily rinsing because of the burning (and drooling) it causes me. So I thought I'd give this a swish and see how I liked it.Flossed, brushed, and grabbed the bottle. I poured half a capfull and tossed it back. Swish swish swish. Spit. There were chunks of blue in the sink. ?! This was odd. My toothpaste is white, so I was sure it was not that. Close inspection of my teeth shows little blue globs of this mouthwash was hanging out all over the place. It's coated on my tongue, so that my entire tongue is blue, and when I try to rinse / brush my mouth out, it creates a strange foam out of nothing.Because I didn't have enough the first go round, I assumed it was a fluke, so I rinsed again. Swish swish swish. Spit. Chunks of blue in the sink and all over my teeth. Another blue tongue.Two hours later and I'm eating crackers with a sour cream dip and I can hardly taste anything. I have a strange chemical feeling on my tongue and gums.Back to Listerine and all the burning, drooling, eye watering glory it provides me."
4.00,"This toothpaste is fine. I don't really notice a huge difference between one toothpaste to another."
1.00,"Stannous fluoride in this product can stain your teeth yellow -- even with the \"whitening agent. Go for the sodium fluoride in another paste."
4.00,"We will see if it really works on the next cleaning at the dentist, but I like the way it makes me teeth feel"
5.00,"ALL i can say is my daughter loved it she told me I had to buy this for her . So needless to say I did, then i tried it , WE are switching toothpastes. thanks for the sample."
4.00,"This toothpaste provides a great clean. Crest has great products that I would recommend."
5.00,"My teenage son requested a mouthwash that wasn't nasty tasting. I purchased the Crest Pro Health Clinical and gave it to him. It left his breath fresh smelling, teeth shiny and a smile on his face. Thank you"
4.00,"I couldn't believe all the bad reviews I love this product,would have given 5 stars but have to admit it does alter the taste for a while, even water tastes funny for a while after using this, but the cleaning results are fantastic, it looks like it basically sucks the placke from teeth and tongue, the white stuff kind off shrinks together and you just spit it out and rinse with water, and your mouth feels a LOT cleaner afterwards, I had a lot of cavities before but no more since I use this mouthwash, it's so aggressive on the germs, I can live with a little funny taste, and no burning at all,...."
4.00,"I loved the samples I received! My whole family thought our mouths felt fresh and clean. Great product!!"
5.00,"I love Crest Pro-Health toothpaste. The texture is great. The flavors are great. My teeth feel fabulously clean after I brush. I like the cap too. Crest Pro-Health is the toothpaste that is now found in my house!!!"
5.00,"After using, my mouth feels fresh for hours. I like knowing I am getting extra protection from plaque all day, too. I recommend!"
4.00,"I love Crest but the clinical left my teeth feeling really smooth and clean. I liked the taste as well as the feel. I would recommend this product and have already"
5.00,"i bought this product for my husband and he loves it for shaving every day can create a toll on his skin. so guys dont think that creams are a woman thing for men also can benefit from it so taking care of your body also entails your skin."
4.00,"I have always used Crest- since I was a kid and now buy it for my family. This product males my teeth feel good and smooth. It is a quality product."
3.00,"I usually love Crest but I'm not a huge fan of the pro-relief. I feel like the taste is off and it leaves my mouth feeling pretty gross. I wish it tasted better."
4.00,"Overall, I liked this product. It is refreshing toothpaste and it doesn't have a funky aftertaste though I found it a bit gritty."
5.00,"I tried the pro-health toothpaste. It had a good taste and left my teeth smooth and feeling clean"
5.00,"Kept my mouth feeling fresh much longer than most products.will definitely buy again"
3.00,"It bubbles white in my entire mouth for a long time which makes it taste funny, but I ave really white teeth now. So I would buy it again!"
5.00,"Our family loves crest prohealth toothpaste. My husband and I always have good check-ups with our dentist thanks to the help of crest toothpaste."
4.00,"I like the taste and texture of the toothpaste. The design of the flip top makes it easier to open and use - a great improvement. As of yet, I don't notice the sensitivity reducing but I've only used it a week so far and should see results."
5.00,"I love this! Fresh feeling for hours!! I could tell it worked for a long time."
5.00,"A great addition to my morning routine. I'm always searching for that little something extra. Thanks."
5.00,"The toothpaste cleans great. It is a bit gritty but the results are fantastic."
3.00,"They need to fix the staining issue. But if you do use this product, be sure to have your mouth fairly clean before using it, and rinse extremely well after using it. I use this product sometimes, and I rinse a lot. Otherwise, if you use it a lot, you will feel the residue. Don't use this product independent of brushing and without rinsing thoroughly. It's also good to alternate and not use the same mouthwash forever, then you can minimize side effects of each product."
5.00,"The best toothpaste I have every used. Leaving my mouth feeling clean and fresh."
3.00,"After reading some of the reviews on this product I asked my dentist if the product caused staining of the teeth. She said it does in some people and that her office no longer gives out samples of the toothpaste or the mouth rinse. It is not possible to know which people will be affected by the stannous floride in this product: she can use it but her sister has the staining issue which while not permanent can be annoying. One would wonder why Crest hasn't changed the formula of this toothpaste. I have used Crest products for years but would not recommend this one."
5.00,"I love the oral b glide floss. It's smooth on my teeth and easy to pull out. Some other floss kind of get stuck between my teeth but not oral b glide floss. Thanks"
4.00,"This mouthwash is great. It has a ton of bubbles and certainly leaves the mouth feely fresh. I am kind of senstive to flouride so I have to be careful using this mouthwash. It is great on cuts inside the mouth. I certainly would recommend this."
5.00,"best quality- i've tried other sale brands before and none of them feel as clean."
4.00,"Teeth feel clean and fresh. I would definitely buy this product again."
4.00,"This is an effective toothpaste for sensitive teeth, really helps. Would give it 5 stars except that it is VERY hard to squeeze out; you end up wrestling with the tube. An improvement would be to make it a little less thick."
5.00,"I love this mouthwash. I had been looking for a good mouthwash for quit a while and now I've found it. It keeps my mouth feeling fresh for hours after I've used it, even after I eat."
4.00,"Everyone in my family loves the new Crest Prohealth toothpaste. My husband now won't use anything else, and the kids like it better than the fruit flavored stuff they usually use. It really makes my teeth feel clean, too!"
5.00,"I love the product it helps whiten your teeth, tastes great and very affordable to purchase. I love how it leaves my breath fresh and a clean feeling."
5.00,"I bought this toothpaste with Jake on the label because it matches the Oral-B Pro-Health Stages Jake power kids toothbrush. I've bought this same toothpaste in the store, but never saw Jake on the outside before. My 4-year-old is going to be very excited! I wish I could have used a coupon, like I can in the store. But it's supply and demand... I haven't seen this in the store, but I found it on Amazon."
4.00,"My teeth are incredibly sensitive and often hurt just by wind blowing on them. Since I have been using this mouthwash I have noticed a big difference. My teeth aren't as sensitive and they don't hurt as much either. Great product!"
4.00,"all toothpastes work really. but this Crest was pretty darn good. my teeth felt squeeky clean all day. Crest is the brand i prefer to buy most of the time."
5.00,"Did a good job of keeping my teeth feeling clean even through the occasional snack and/or drink."
1.00,"If it is, it's not funny. I purchased this after analyzing the box and the claims it made about dental health, etc. I used it twice before searching the internet to see if I wasn't the only person to experience bizarre problems with this toothpaste. Both times I used it, my cheeks and gums appeared to lighten up by many shades while I simultaneously felt a drying, chemical-y sensation to my whole mouth. It was so intense I thought I was having an allergic reaction the second time. Afterward, my mouth was full of dead cheek/gum tissue. It was really frightening. I've had that happen to a lesser extent in the past but, never as bad as with this toothpaste. I had to pull it out of my dry, numbed mouth in gobs with my fingers. To top it off, my mouth seriously felt anesthetized for some time after use. Also, my gums bled more while I brushed than with any other toothpaste. Then my teeth hurt so much where my gums bled! I honestly can't help but think of some horror movie where I've been poisoned and my teeth are falling out. It reminds me of the effects drugs or radiation have on people! This is a terrible product, please save your money and sense of well-being by not purchasing this."
5.00,"This mouthwash works and does a great job. Very good product."
4.00,"The pre rinse not only helps with whitening but also freshens breath."
4.00,"I really liked this mouthwash. It left my mouth feeling clean and fresh alot long than most I have used in the past."
1.00,"This Crest \"Pro-Health Complete\" does a great job freshening my breath, but at the expense of being able to taste food normally for hours after using it. There are a lot of other reviewers with the same experience, so it seems to effect a lot of people the same way.                                                                     We have already stopped using this and will not go back to it.                                                                     CFH"
