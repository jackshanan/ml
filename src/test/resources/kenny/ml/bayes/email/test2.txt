Reply-To: ITP Alumni <itp-alumni@forums.nyu.edu>

Not totally up the Technology Alley - but it is a great company in San Francisco, with good values run by someone I can personally certify as on the ball and cool! (my sister rocks.)

I would do the print ad myself, but I haven't done print since 1997 and I'll end up using web-safe colors or something silly...

Let me know if anyone is interested...

Hi Friends,
 
Net Impact is currently looking for two important roles.  Please forward to anyone you think might be interested!
 
Print Ad Campaign Design
 
For the first time, Net Impact is launching a print ad campaign.  We have already secured space in several high profile magazines, but we need help creating the print ad portfolio.  Ideally there is a designer out there who would like to create our ad portfolio pro bono,.  Their work would appear in Worthwhile Magazine, Sustainable Industries Journal, Business Ethics, Time Magazine (potentially!), our annual guidebook and beyond!  Please email me if you or someone you know is interested.
 
Development Director
 
We are currently looking for a full time Development Director to join our dynamic and exciting management team.  This person’s responsibilities would include designing strategy for corporate sponsorships; researching and writing foundation grant materials; cultivating and developing relationships with key contacts; and more.  Salary is competitive, benefits are excellent, and the organization is one with enormous potential.  Click here for more information.
 
 
Thanks!
-Liz
