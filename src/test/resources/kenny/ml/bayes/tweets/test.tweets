I really wanna see the Avengers!
men in black III looks sick omg
American Pie: Reunion was JOKES! Definitely worth watching
Never watch dark tide...absolutely horrible movie!
I found a local theater that's playing The Raid: Redemption. I hope that it lives up to the hype.
So nobody's gonna call out this 'Chernobyl Diaries' film on it's insensitive bullshit? Hey! Let's also make a found footage Holocaust movie!
Last night I went to see the movie 'Bully'. Please go see it. It's an important movie. Really.
The Kid With a Bike -- really wonderful film. Not about politics. At all.
Check out Goon @moviefone http://t.co/xUxMbHPd this looks pretty funny
Movie Review: Funny, profane &#39;Goon&#39; lights the lamp
The Avengers is like the greatest porn for a comic geek
21 jump street was hilarious. Idk why I waited so long to see it!

RT @ItsKeem: The Raid: Redemption is still action film of the year tho.
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter is about Lincoln hunting & killing vampires. Idk, what's more stupid: the plot or that a studio said make it
BTW Hunger Games might possibly be the best movie I ever saw...
Watched The movie DETENTION, I suggest you ppl to watch it... Well worth it. Good job traavv!! @OrganikHipHop
I need to see the chimpanzee movie in the theater

I have done nothing but crying my way through this movie. Weird I haven't heard about it until today.
I wanna see Project X again sooo bad.

Just watched "God Bless America" This movie is a case study in why California won't let you have assault weapons.
Watching a little bit of heaven, while being hungover was never going to be a good idea
Cool Friday so far "Think Like a Man" was funny! Let's keep it rolling

standing ovation for hunger games movie lol
@TheRock Rock you the best wrestler and good at acting in movies I'm excited to see the G.I. Joe: Retaliation Continued the good work.
Last night I dreamed I was watching the movie in theaters again and I loved it!
It's a shame John Carter flopped so badly. I've been told that it's actually a pretty good movie. I mainly blame it's lackluster ad campaign
I know it's a kids film but I so badly wanna go see Dr Seuss' The Lorax!
Monsieur Lazhar; a lovely little French Canadian film about loss. Kids are really sweet, teacher kind and thoughtful. Thanks @Filmhouse
