Tim and Eric's billion dollar movie.  #wtfdidijustwatch
The decoy bride is confusing
London Paris New York is so boring. watched 45mins almost died. shee
I watched the worst 2 movies last night - London Paris New York & Ghost Protocol - Jerk and Pointless movies.
Can't get over how bad Salmon fishing in the Yemen was, if u wana waste 2hrs of ur life go watch it #zzzzzzz
#TerribleDisneyMovies that 'John Carter' piece of crap
Watching this stupid ass movie  called Brake
Wrath of the titans by far the crappiest battles scenes @ #fyi
Goon was such a pointless movie.. Waste of time.
Goon is such a retarded movie. #wasteoftime
Wrath of the titans was pretty gay #Dontwasteyourmoney
I'm not gonna lie, Wrath of the Titans is a horrible, wasted $20 of mine #NationalHonestyDay
21 Jump Street was kind of funny, but not worth paying to see.
Hey Johnny the new movie 21 jump street..... SUCKED! The original series with u was way better.?u!
The Three Stooges is probably thee dumbest movie ive ever seen! ......I knew it would be  #wasteoftime
Do not go see The Three Stooges...it was terrible...#WASTEOFMONEY
i saw the three stooges today it sucked!!Dont waste your money on that crap!
People made the Hunger Games seem like a better movie than it really is....
The hunger games movie really disappointed me.
the Hunger Games movie... #majordisappointment
american pie the reunion sucked. tara reid is still hot doe
So uh. Lockout sucked.
Oh yeah hi btw I illegally watched American pie reunion online and it sucked.
the five-year engagement could quite possibly be the most boring, worst movie ive evvvvvver seen
The Five-Year Engagement was BORING!!!
The Five-Year Engagement started out funny, then got boring, then funny again, then sad, then stupid, then cheesy, and then credits.
The Lucky One honestly wasn't even that good. The book was so much better.
Awee, im kinda disappointed in the lucky one. It wasn't anywhere close to being as good as the book. #exceptional #sadtweet
Hmm the lucky one is probably one of the worst movies iv seen Ina while
The lucky one wasnt as exciting as I thought it would be D:
the rumors that i actually liked the lorax movie have been greatly exaggerated
having a hard time watching the decoy bride #soconfused
#BoringMovies Wrath of the Titans. Wasted time and money for that shit
#BoringMovies mirror mirror. i watched it yesterday and i was disappointed
Just saw french romance Goodbye First Love, totally boring romance about girl who can't get over first boyfriend. Who cares, girl? 1.5 stars
whoever said it was cool... 21 Jump Street sucked..
A Men In Black III is seriously not necessary.
The Five-Year Engagement is mostly a drag, but it has a few great scenes that almost save it.
why the heck are we watching some chimpanzee movie?
Watching London, Paris, new York.... Kinda bored already :/
Wrath of the titans..worst movie EVER. Dont waste ur money on that dumb movie, not even when it comes out on redbox
Never watch dark tide...absolutely horrible movie!
watching a wack movie to help falling asleep>>>> sorry Eddie Murphy (thousand words)
Oh. Saw Goodbye First Love while in the US. It's great, but I was kind of disappointed. Feels a bit like a step backwards.
Hyphens seem to break our links. The Five-Year Engagement is super boring. Our review. http://t.co/yKT7uXKs
The Ballad of Genesis and lady Jaye was completely bizarre. Courtney Love in ten years.
Sooo Thomas from Project X is really hot.. Movie sucked tho
So what happened to the great Israeli film FOOTNOTE? Opened & vanished from screens in a blink.
The film 'Salmon fishing in the yemen' is the biggest pile of crap i have ever seen #dontwatchit
Thousand words , what a useless pointless movie !
Deep blue sea is really one of the most stupid movies I ever saw.
@MYMHM watched mirror mirror or snow white yesterday. Good movie, but the end was really weird and ruined the whole experience.
Want to watch Headhunters tonight, not sure if I can handle 1 hour 40 mins of subtitles though.
A Thousand Words is the worst movie ever
Finally watched the movie "A thousand words". Decent if you ask me
The Moth Diaries is terrible
We better get some good trailers for this movie. Don't waste my time if you're gonna show The Dictator.
Think Like a Man sucked.. #wasteoftime
"Being Flynn" was touchy even a bit harsh by its strong characters.
Watching The Decoy Bride with my dad and he is finding their Scottish accents incredibly weird. Omfg I'm dying
@HanReed_ oh really :( we watched silent house today which was also shit. Modern horror films just suck I think
Just watched The Silent House - what a crock! Opening my bills is scarier.
@mobbin1987 Dark Tide with Halle ...I love her, but not this movie lol
The hunger games were better as a book.The movie sucked compared to it!#THG
So... to be clear, The Giant Mechanical Man is kinda depressing... bloody hell movies are sucking today, Avengers better be good...
I'm finally watching 'London, Paris, New York'... Something just isn't right about Ali Zafar, can't put my finger on it.
@badasian it might be the theater. He fell asleep halfway through The Lorax lol. He doesn't fall asleep with movies at home.
John Carter was so bad that we both fell asleep and when we woke up it was still on so we left
Just watched Silent House. The last 20 minutes got my heart racing, but uh, what the hell was that ending? I'm so utterly confused.
Being the only person in a theater for The Ballad of Genesis and Lady Jaye is an odd experience.
I'm disappointed that Friends With Kids was actually Every Character In This Movie Has Kids.
If I could go back over my life and choose just one thing to do differently, I would choose to not watch The Decoy Bride with David Tennant.
Silent House is possibly one of the most boring movies I have ever watched
The Deep Blue Sea was alright. Wasn't on my list of favorite movies. It was very depressing and the acting was great.
I love the soundtrack of The Deep Blue Sea, but that's mostly it, I think. Sadly
The only reason i watched Mirror Mirror is the fact Julia Roberts is rolling in! Awesome actress, the movie sucks.
Wrath of the titans = waste of time .. stuppid movie
@LeahHather American Reunion sucked ass, filming and uploading my review tomorrow. #waitingforthehate
Do NOT see the Three Stooges; waste of time & money.
I barely saw The Three Stooges. I'm late, but it wasn't even that good. #WasteOfTime.
The movie lockout is a waste of time.
I just saw The Hunger Games.  It sucked.  There are no real characters in the movie.
Sooo hunger Games was just an ok movie, id say it sucked but only bc i expected more due to the hype
Yea, and DO NOT WATCH LOCKOUT!!! That movie sucked ass.
Darling Companion looks wretched.
damn playback. i guess im not used to this kind of movies anymore
@syazwanzhero Playback ? Totally horrible movie.
Stupid stupid stupid. Don't waste your money. RT @taycain: Seeing The Five-Year Engagement. This better be funny.
Well the Giant Mechanical Man was ..... Uh ... Underwhelming!!
Refuses to watch that disgraceful movie God Bless America #tcot
@EddieO78 watched it few weeks ago. Gets bleaker the further in you manage to get. #Snowtown btw it was renamed The Snowtown Murders for US
Just watched silent house, what a let down!
Silent house...if u haven't already watched it, don't bother!
@SCodling11 we went to see 21 Jump Street....I thought it sucked but others seem to like it...
Just watching the intruders and thid movie is boring
@dssyzx avengers was coooollllll my first sci fi movie, didn't disappoint me. Titanic not quite worth it to watch 3D cos not very 3D
Battleship...... To me SUCKED AS A NEW ALIEN INVATION MOVIE
Who ever wastes money to see the movie the dictator is an idiot, hands down. That movie looks so stupid bro.
Am I the only one that thought American pie the reunion sucked.
@MMA_FER i watched Silent House, it wasnt that good !! but i still had a GREAT time, best birthday ever
Think like a man fucking sucked, I walked out in the middle of that shit.
the cabin in the woods sucked imo. it had a few scares but i just felt like it was trying to be a film from the 80s. #Disappointed
if you take your boyfriend to see the movie "what to expect when you're expecting," you're officially psycho #justsaying
I'm so happy I didn't see "Think Like A Man" in the movies.....The movie Sucked!!! #IMO
Oh yeah.."think like a man" sucked...Kevin Hart was funny..but not the whole time
Was kind of disappointed in Let the Bullets Fly.  Had some enjoyable moments but never really came together like I expected.  Sigh...
Damn, Tim and Eric's Billion Dollar Movie was not good. This surprises me.
sooo a thousand words is definately one of those movies u really gotta pay attention too i was all types of lost lol
"La casa de mi padre" ..what an awful movie
That is 2 hours of my life I will never get back. Mirror Mirror has to be the lamest movie I have ever watched.
clash of the Titans and Wrath of the Titans are HORRIBLE movies!
@MerrieLeininger Hopefully better than "We Have a Pope"
Oh Titanic.... Such a good movie. 3D didn't really change much except for giving me a headache. Where's my and @melissalok's Jack Dawson?
Just saw Titanic in 3D with my friend at the cinema. I'd forgotten how bloody long that movie is... :P
The Chimpanzee movie wasn't that interesting. Lol but since I talked to my friends most of the time, it was fun :)
Chimpanzee might be the dumbest movie I've ever watched! Guess that's what happens when you let a 5 yr old pick out the movie! #naptime
Btw I think that movie Think like a man sucked...the acting was sub par for it to be so many experienced actors in it..
Just watched silent house, its weird! Everyone left baffed! :/
Went and watched Silent House last night with My Bebek!! Not a great film, but a fucked and deep story line with a good twist!!
I will never recommend the movie Detachment to anyone, ever.
That bully movie was a waste of time.
Watched the two films #INTRUDERS and #THEDEVILINSIDE what a waste of time on both, hoping #CORIOLANUS will be good
Think like a man sucked. Wait to c it on dvd if u haven't been to c it. So predictable
@Awesome_G_Bro we are not watching battleship. That movie looks dumb. -_-
the dictator is going to be a dumb ass movie, i wont even waste my money.
Cabin in the Woods kinda sucked.
Cabin in the Woods #Sucked
I went to go see cabin in the woods last night & it sucked #butt
Just got home went to movies saw the avengers it sucked dont see it
For the record. The avengers sorta sucked. #overhyped
Haha. The Avengers fucking sucked. Congrats Internet, you've fucked me again.
The Avengers sucked. #ThingsPeopleNeverSay
Saw london paris new york. What a badly edited, narrated, screenplay was horrible.I mean it was like watching a pirated film cut into pieces
I like Sherlock, but the fandom is still almost as bad as the Lorax fandom. No thanks, no thanks.
Silent house is the most confusing film I have ever watched, my head is gone after that!
It's a shame John Carter flopped so badly. I've been told that it's actually a pretty good movie. I mainly blame it's lackluster ad campaign
Watched 'Silent House'. Still don't understand what the fuck actually happened.
"Salmon Fishing In The Yemen" as a movie title! Really? No, seriously?! Had to get it out. Been on my mind for weeks. #awful #badtitle
I forgot to say, I just went to see Silent House and I didn't get it at all. Has anyone watched it that could help me?:/
The new movie "friends with kids" is really really boring but will watch it for Megan fox ?
Watching "Being Flynn" requires patience. The film got its potential, but there're so many distractions and flaws in between.
Seeking Justice sucks, Nicolas Cage retire please! Good plot ruined big time
Movie: Brake. One of the coolest 90 minutes so far in 2012 and one of the worst 10 minutes so far in 2012. #CrapEnding
I watched "mirror, mirror" I expected more, is just the kind of movie that disappointed you
INTRUDERS! Just kidding. I just wasted two hours of my life
Titanic 3D<<<<< Original Titanic. I could've made a better 3D movie myself. #BLURRY
lmfaooo, i heard the the only thing thats 3D in the new titanic movie is the title! #LmfaoDead
Watched titanic today too. The 3D effect was disappointing. I dun even feel anything flying towards me. Just make it a 2D movie la!
I rated 'The Moth Diaries' 1 out of 5 stars ? http://t.co/8Bpmi7rC
That movie Battleship sucked though!!
The dictator the movie looks weak wouldn't waste ma bread
Watchin This Dumb Chimpanzee Movie To Waste Time .
All this talk about "Think like a man" seriously? Movie sucked
John Carter. Good Concept. Bad Romance. #fb
“@TCIIIyeee: BTW..Project X is a real shitty movie...yall hype anything up..smh..” lmao. It ain't look that good to me. I aint see it yet.
I just finally saw this Project X movie....it was TRASH!
As much trepidation and doubt as I felt about John Carter, I feel a corresponding amount of excitement and anticipation for 'Prometheus'
I've been watching Brake for an hour now. So far the entire movie is revolved around a man making phone calls in a box.
Movie review: ‘We Have a Pope’ shifts uneasily from comedy to drama – Salt Lake Tribune http://t.co/Rv2SsVc7
The audio is really underwhelming in this movie. #Playback #horror
Safe is such a boring movie.
Safe is such a meh movie. No different from his others.
The movie "Safe",sorry I went to see that one.
If the full movie is as boring as the trailer, 'The Dictator' will be 2 hours of laugh-or-I'll-shoot.
I wanted to watch that battleship movie until Rihanna popped up on the preview. Nevermind.
So nobody's gonna call out this 'Chernobyl Diaries' film on it's insensitive bullshit? Hey! Let's also make a found footage Holocaust movie!
the chernobyl diaries movie is so dumb
You literally could not pay me enough money to go and see "Chernobyl Diaries."
The worst movie I've ever seen -_-

The Cabin In The Woods -_-
The Cabin In the Woods... Quite the ridiculous film. Not sure I'd recommend it.
I feel like the movie Chernobyl diaries is just making a mockery of a tragic event that affected a whole nation #notcool
Saw Dark Shadows. It was crap. Go watch The Avengers a second time instead.
Dark Shadows.Uh.After looking at all those reviews,I don't think I'll be watching the movie anytime soon.
don't get how movies like piranha 3DD and the cabin in the woods actually get funding to be filmed?! #unbelieveblyshite
lol Piranha 3DD? Is this a joke? tell me no one will watch that movie please
Piranha: 3DD. Looks like a shit movie but great title!
PIRANHA 3DD is the SINGLE WORST MOVIE EVER! FUCKING DOG-SHIT!
They just showed a clip of Snow White and the Huntsman on Graham Norton. Good god it looked so BORING! #Film #BBC
My bro on Bel Ami, "that's totally a porno movie for women! Guys doesn't wan't to see guys butts!" Lol! I agreed with him xD ~Rori
Movies to see absolutely:
- THE LUCKY ONE.
- HUNGER GAMES.
I don't like 'Bel Ami' by Robert Pattinson.
It's no sense :S
The movie trailer for Rock of Ages starring Tom Cruise looks like a cheezy version of Jesus Christ Superstar and Xanadu...lol!
Another preview I saw at the theater was for "Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter" NO
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter is about Lincoln hunting & killing vampires. Idk, what's more stupid: the plot or that a studio said make it
Finally saw the Hunger Games the other day. The whole audience burst out laughing when a trailer for Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter came on
has anyone seen the trailer for 'abraham lincoln: vampire hunter'? is it supposed to be a joke?
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter is the stupidest movie I've ever seen
Omg they got a trailer for a movie called "Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter". The whole audience was like Wtf?
I also saw a preview for Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter. That look on your face right now? Same one I had in the theater.
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter omg i cant. It's a real movie. Like they just showed the trailer for it
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter WTF, I mean bitch REALLY what the heck
last night i saw the preview for a movie called Abraham Lincoln: Vampire hunter. #wtf #areyoukiddingme
so they got the movie coming out called "Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter".  So this is how my kids are gonna learn U.S history?  -.-
Finally saw that Magic Mike trailer in front of Dark Shadows. Looks impressively mediocre.
Omg...a movie about a male dancer called magic mike its coming out...seriously...when will the foolery end lol -GiGi?
"Magic Mike" will be the biggest Lady Boner movie of 2012, hands down. Have fun ladies, Ill just go see Spiderman :D
OMG pls dnt waste ur money on watchin Piranha 3dd..its d worst movie ever
Went to see 'Piranha 3DD' today at the cinema. Worse. Movie. Ever. Yet it was so bad, it was good.. #VingRhames #TitaniumLegBitch
Piranha 3DD is the worst movie I've ever seen haha
Still indifferent about this Prometheus movie, may watch it online
@HeinekenStew hell yeah, btw, i saw Bel Ami today on internet & i hate the End of the movie >.<
Is there anything more horrifying than the Rock of Ages movie? Put your shirt on, Cruise. PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD.
Lol “@radhika756: I love Andy Samberg but not enough to watch that stupid "That's My Boy" movie. Wtf was he thinking?”
I keep watching this G.I. Joe: Retaliation trailer.  I know I'm going to be like 900 kinds of disappointed when I actually see the movie.
"Let's go see Battlefield America" - No one
#ICriedWhen I wathed The Lorax. That damn movie gets to a lady!
The Lorax just became my favorite movie.

Saw new movie 'The Salt of Life' set in Rome. Funny & melancholy portrait of declining bourgeois Roman (and Italian) society. #Italy #film

THE KID WITH A BIKE = Perfect example of why I love movies! Simple, beautiful, so much heart! Merci aux freres Dardenne!
