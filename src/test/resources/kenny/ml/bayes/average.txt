You guys should see the loading times in  City Undercover. When the game starts you get a loading bar which lasts over a minute. This takes you to the start screen. Once you press start you get another loading bar lasting the same amount of time. Everytime you start a new mission you get the loading bar.

 BentBricks: Sale is over. I already have it and was soooo tempted to get another one so I could expand my existing Arkham. The minifigs alone sell for $70+ on Bricklink so that would have subsidized a 2nd Arkham a LOT. The temptation is now gone. Phew. Jesus. That was fast. Well, that mak...

Yeah,  City is actually really really fun. Basically a GTA game, but is made to be funny and fun, rather than violent, gory, and provocative. A nice change of pace from all the increasingly violent games that we keep getting, though I do love me some good ol' gory fighter/shooter games too.

If anyone is patient, the game will be sold for $15-$10 by November. All Warner published games reach that price eventually ( Batman/HarryPotter/Lord of the rings/Batman Arkham/Mortal Kombat).

A note on  City and its loading issue, as I've played all of TT"s previous games including on PC w/ lots of ram and a fast HDD.

 StayTuned As I said earlier, I don't think  is a toy for adults. Once you grow older, the fun is in building complicated things like car replicas. But once built, you can't play around with it, unless you go on your knees shouting "PEW PEW". That's childish. For kids, it's an awesome...

's were the foundation of much creativity and imagination both things I lack as an adult. Even at the age of 30 if someone gave me a bunch of 's I would probably play with them quite often assuming I had a large workstation to enjoy which I currently don't.

  Treihing Uh, the OP said downgrade from an SUV. The CRV is more like a  car or a shopping cart. The CRV is a lot smaller on the outside than seemingly possible, I definitely agree with that.
A well placed  also makes for a great incapacitating trap for mom or dad. It's like  was made for that purpose and the ability to build with them was just a bi-product of it's viscous design.
Yes, the  build is a radical approach for Ferrari. All of the pieces are easily replaceable, but the assembly is of questionable durability. There was also a huge cost savings since large parts of the car were constructed by students at the Maranello elementary school.
Wish you had $20,000 to create this  masterpiece? Me too. This impressive recreation of the epic battle of Helm’s Deep took four months, 150,000 bricks and 1,700 minifigs to build.
