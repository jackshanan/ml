  Absolutely the best shower I have ever taken! I tried Total Effects Body Wash 7 in 1 and I was never so pleasantly surprised.....I have used Oil of Olay body wash with Shea Butter since body washes came out and slowly started to take over the shower in place of harsh and drying bar soaps..How I ever used bar soap I'll never know b/c once I tried wash I couldnt go back. But this new one has gone far beyond my expectations...a little pricey but well worth it..As the mother of a very active 4 year old, the shower is my one escape each day,..it is my one treat that I try to maximize to make it my daily therapy and this truly has enhanced that mirage and I thank you OOO! Keep up the great work.
I have been using the Total Effects 7-in-1 Advanced Aging Body for a few weeks. The results are absolutely AMAZING! African Americans skin tends to dry and "ash" easily after showering. I am proud to say that I don't even have to use lotion -after showering EVER AGAIN! The moisturizing in Total Effects 7-in-1 is the best defense against that dry, "ash" effect that I sometimes get after showering with other body washes with so-called moisturizers. Total Effects is worth it's weight in gold!
I love the hydrating version of this body wash. My 56 year old skin has perked up and looks so much smoother. It feels so soft and supple and I never thought my dry skin could feel so good.I love the scent, too. It wins over the Clinique one I was previously using. Why spend more money when Olay works, not just the same, but better:) I'm hooked!
OMG!!! I love this product. From day one I could tell the difference in my skin. It was moist and even smelled great. I love the way it makes my skin feel and smells.. I will never use anything else. Another plus is that you dont have to use very much. A little bit goes a long ways. I have had the same bottle for almost two months now.
I received a small sample size recently. Within 3 days of my first use I was hooked. Day One I noticed a difference in the softness of my skin. Day Two was even more noticeable and Day Three had me at the store buying a full-size bottle. After two weeks I am still pleased!
This is the first bath wash I have ever used that actually made my skin feel better after coming out of the shower. I like to take hot showers and they can dry out my skin. I simply love the Total Effects. It smells terrific which is very important to me since I use it everyday and it feels so silky! Finally my skin feels calm and relaxed, and looks that way too! Worth the price.
I love how this body wash makes my skin feel...even several hours after showering! I have used it for about 2 weeks now and my skin is much less dry and much more soft than before. I have tried many different products but this is by far my favorite.I love how this body wash makes my skin feel...even several hours after showering!

I typically do not like any body washes but this one rocks! Not only does it moisturize, its FADES STRETCHMARKS! My hot pink ugly 8 year old stretchmarks are now white after just a few weeks! My skin feels so soft all day. Highly recommend.I typically do not like any body washes but this one rocks! Not only does it moisturize, its FADES STRETCHMARKS!

I am not one that brags about a product but I LOVE Olay Total Effects. In less than a week there was a noticable difference in the way my skin felt and looked. I was amazed. Now I tell all my friends. Thank you Olay!I am not one that brags about a product but I LOVE Olay Total Effects.

I have used lots of body washes but never one as great as this! My skin has never felt so soft and stayed so soft all day long. I've used Olay products for years and years, and am so glad they came up with this product!I have used lots of body washes but never one as great as this!

I read about this bodywash in a magazine review and decided to try it. I was having to slather lotion on my legs every day or I would have alligator skin! I have been using this for 2 weeks, since then lotion is no longer needed! I love it especially since summer is here! I just pray that this doesn't get taken off the market!
I received a sample of this product and have subsequently bought it. I never liked a body wash before, but this product is AMAZING! I used to have to put baby oil on my skin after a shower to keep my skin quenched; but no more! Since I have been using Olay Total Effects, I no longer need to tale the extra step to insure soft silky skin.
This winter I have had the worst dry skin I've ever had, and I'm only 24. My job requires frequent hand washing, and needless to say my hands were looking bad. I did lotions everyday! I got a sample of this bodywash and after ONE USE the dry lines on my hands disappeared! The scent is amazing and the way my skin feels...it's like winter never even happened at all. I love this stuff!!!
My skin always looks like tanned leather this time of the year. My sister called me and told me about this product, I bought it, and, was I surprised! My hands don't look like alligator claws and my legs are smooth. Best of all, it's not too smelly (I have allergies), and it lasts a while! I'm making my way back to OLAY!
I have used Total Effects Moisturizer for many years. At 63 I was approached (while attending a Senior 55+ event) and asked if I was old enough to attend. When I saw the announcement of Total Effects body wash comming soon I was thrilled. I have used Oil of Olay products for as long as I can remember. I truly can't recall using any other product. It's no surprize my skin feels and smells great! Thank you, thank you, thank you. Customer for life.
I am aging and have a thyroid condition. My skin had a dullness and started drying somewhat.After using this product in the shower, I pat some of the water off my skin and air dry the rest. The body wash leaves an oily residue which traps the water between the skin and residue.I now have soft skin that has a health glow. I haven't had that in a long time.It smells nice too.
The Olay Total Effects Body Wash is the best body wash I have ever used. Normally during the winter my legs are scaly and dry despite using lotion. With the Olay Body Wash, my legs look and feel great - no scalies for me!! Love the product and will continue to use it.
Its been 5 days since i began using this product and every day my skin gets softer and softer. When i step out of the shower, lotion is optional...Thank goodness im so done with 4 different misc body washes cluttering up the shower. From now on this will be my one and only because it really delivers on the promise. Thanks Olay !! : )
I loved the Total Effects Daily Facial Moistureizer. I didn' t think it could be topped but, this is the ticket. I feel like I am spoiling myself while taking my shower. I have sensitive skin but, the fragrance in this doesn't bother my skin , it's very light and appealing.The bodywash is light and fluffy and it is very creamy. It made my skin feel very soft and I didn't need a moistureizer after my shower. Pure elegance !!!!!!!!
I have NEVER been surprised by the consistency, feel, and smell of a body wash before in my life. It's velvety smooth and lathers evenly. Honestly, it's pure extravagance in a body wash, so much so that I'm going online to buy the full size from a sample I got in the mail. And NO they didn't pay me to write this! I just wanted to express just how in LOVE I am with this body wash. This one, they got right.
I always try olays new products when i see them, so of course i had to try this one. Let me say i just love the way it makes my skin feel.I always try olays new products when i see them, so of course i had to try this one. Let me say i just love the way it makes my skin feel.
This body wash is absolutely amazing! I have super dry skin and usually have to smother my legs and arms with lotion after a shower...only to have them dry again within an hour!! Afer my first use of this product I didn't need to use lotion after my shower! My body is silky smooth. It lathers very well and has a nice subtle scent. Bravo Olay!
This is the first body wash that I could actually FEEL the difference in the softness of my skin. I've been looking for it in stores since I received my sample in the mail. I'm excited to see it will be available next month.This is the first body wash that I could actually FEEL the difference in the softness of my skin.

I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT THE WEEK OF MY BDAY. WHAT A GREAT GIFT FROM OLAY.I WENT THE NEXT DAY TO SEVERAL STORES AND NO ONE HAD THIS PRODUCT. YES I WILL BUY THIS PRODUCT. I HAVE TRIED ALL THE BODY WASHES ON THE MARKET AND NONE SO FAR MAKES MY SKIN FEEL THIS GOOD. I CANT WAIT TO SEE HOW MY SKIN WILL FEEL AFTER A MONTH OF USING. SO FAR I HAVE ONLY USED ON MY ARMS BECASUE THEY ARE THE DRYESS. AND I DIDNT KNOW WHEN I WOULD GET MORE. THANK YOU OLAY FOR ANOTHER GREAT PRODUCT. PLEASE KEEP MAKING MORE.
This body-wash leaves my entire body feeling so smooth. I noticed the differennce by the second day. My mother is 91 years old. Her skin has really been shedding. After washing her several times, it was like night and day. I've also convinced my two sisters to try it.
I got a sample in the mail and ran out to find it! Not in stores at the time yet. So, I got the e-mail about the limited online sale and went onto it too late.....sold out. Will be the first in line to buy as soon as it hits retail outlets! Great product!!!
This is a wonderful body wash. I have dry skin and this works wonderfully! The smell is delicious! I was looking for this product also. It would be great if it came out sooner than Febuary!

I tried the sample and asked my boyfriend to get this for me for Christmas. Usually, he gets me something from Bath and Body Works, but I loved the Total Effects Body Wash so much that he searched everywhere. He found out after Christmas we can get the body wash in Feburary. He said he's giving me an IOU for the body wash.
Got sample in mail, used for 5 days and have not put any other lotion on all week. No dry skin - great product - can't wait until I can get it in the store - will always buy itGot sample in mail, used for 5 days and have not put any other lotion on all week.

I have been totally obscessed with this product since I received a mailed sample via Walmart. I called Olay, as well as looking in every store I shop at since I got that sample. I cannot honestly say it is the best moisturizer......... I really don't care. I would buy it for the scent/cleasnign ability alone. The scent is soooooooooo delicious that if it were bottled as perfume, I would buy it to use in that way. I CAN'T wait until Feb! We were riginally told it would be available in Jan........now it's Feb...........PLEASE don't make us wait any longer!
I have tried many many acne kits (proactive, clean n clear, neutragena, acnefree(original, severe, redness reducer,...)etc.. But none of them have worked! So now I've found a new routine that has truly helped my face clear up and is inexpensive.1) I use a 2% salicylic acid facial cleanser (i use Neutrogena Acne Treatment Oil-Free Acne Wash)2) a 2% salicylic acid facial scrub (I like this Olay Total effects because it is also anti aging/blemish control, by using all those other acne products, it has given me wrinkles so this product is erasing those horrible damages on my face)*pat dry and let it dry for 10 minutes before 3rd step*3) 10% benzole peroxide gel (I use Zapzyt: Gel Acne Treatment)with all these chemicals on the face, it will dry your face up so you do need a face moisturizer. I prefer a moisturizer that has SPF as well because when using acne products you need to protect your face from sun exposure or your face will become very red and irritated.I really hoped this helped those with acne problems :]
a quality product to add to your shower or night routine for any type of face.

I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT THREE WEEKS AGO, AND FROM THE MOMENT THAT I FIRST USED IT, I FELT AND SAW A NOTICEABLE IMPROVEMENT IN THE APPEARANCE OF MY OILY, ACNE PRONE SKIN. AT MY AGE WHEN YOU THINK THAT ALL YOUR ACNE PROBLEMS ARE OVER. ITS GREAT TO FIND A PRODUCT THAT CLEARS IT UP AND LEAVES THE SKIN LESS SHINY LOOKING FOR A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF TIME AFTER CLEANSING. I USE THE PRODUCT TWICE DAILY, ITS EXTREMELY EASY TO USE AND TO RINSE OFF; AND I HAVE NOT HAD A BREAKOUT SINCE USING. THANK YOU OLAY AND WALMART. THIS A WONDERFUL PRODUCT.
I love that this prodcut contains salicylic acid. It always makes me feel like I am getting a deep clean.I love that this prodcut contains salicylic acid. It always makes me feel like I am getting a deep clean.

This has been my favorite cleanser for years and would recommend to anyone. It is creamy, smells nice, has no harsh chemical or drying reaction on my skin. My face is left clean, and smooth. I use topical blemish control (also with salicylic acid) and together, blemishes are under control. Since I am over 50, that is a good thing!Finding the right facial cleanser can be difficult. If they moisturize too much skin gets greasy and cause breakouts. If they "clean" too harshly, they dry out the skin contributing to blemishes and making my face feel tight and pulled. This cleanser has a nice balance leaving my face soft.The product is mild enough that it can be used more than once a day. In our hot Florida summers that is very important. Sometimes I use a small square facial scrub pad with this cleanser to really buff the skin. Again, since the cleanser itself is mild, it does not irritate or cause blemishes.The product size is good, it lasts. Price fits tight budget too. Only downside to this product, usually have to buy this product online. The local stores tend to carry the version without salicylic acid.
I started using this product a month ago....and trust me when i say there is a GREAT difference there is a difference in my face. I have built a regimen. I use this product when i get home from work with the matching moisturiser. I use the matching revitaliser face wash in the mornings along with the moisturiser.I was a previous Mary Kay user and it is not in the same category Thanks OLAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I've used this product 2x a day for 5 weeks, now. My skin feels so clean and soft after I wash my face. My face always had little bumps under the skin...zits just waiting to happen. I now have no bumps under my skin. I love this stuff, will continue to use it and recommend it to whoever asks.
I love this product. I was having major breakouts and started to get blemishes from squeezing the pimples on my face. I started using this product and now my blemishes are going away and my face feels so soft and smooth. I use this product twice a day. I would suggest this to anyone suffering from acne and blemishes.
i have tried hundreds of facial cleansers and nothing ever continuously kept my skin clear. this product really works on acne and keeps my face so soft. AND>> the price is right! thank you olay.. do not EVER stop maing this product!i have tried hundreds of facial cleansers and nothing ever continuously kept my skin clear. this product really works on acne and keeps my face so soft.

I have been a faithful user of ProActiv for 11 years. Two months ago, I ran out 3 weeks before my next shipment. I saw Olay Total Effects with Blemish Control and thought I'd try it. What a find! My skin looks and feels amazing. It cleans my skin better than the ProActiv. My skin has never been this clear before. It is amazing! I hope this product never gets discontinued. I've been using Olay products since I was a teenager and never tried this. I am so glad I did!!!
I have been using the total effects cleanser for about 6 months and I love it I would love to try the moisturizer!I have been using the total effects cleanser for about 6 months and I love it I would love to try the moisturizer!

I'm absolutely in love with this stuff. I've tried literally every product on the shelves and nothing was working on my skin. I'm 20 and have been suffering with acne since I was 12. After 2 weeks of using this I've noticed a huge difference in how my skin looks and feels. There's less blemishes, it's glowing, it's just 100% improving. I'm never using anything else ever again.
I am 42 and have tried numerous skin care products for my acne prone skin. This cleanser along with the Total effects daily moisturizer (frag-free) has not only helped control my acne but also leaves my skin super soft. I have never been able to say that before! Thank you and please don't ever discontinue these 2 products : ).
Please do not ever stop making this product. I always had acne as a teen, and now in my 50's I still have the acne.This is the "only" product that helps and makes a difference! Please don't ever stop making this....it's wonderful.Please do not ever stop making this product.

i would have to rate this product as my #1. i was a lil skeptical at 1st, since i have very DRY skin, and its also SENSITIVE, but due to my stressful job i started to breakout like crazy. (i never did before). when i saw the ingridents in this cleanser I was like .. maybe not. but thn i was sold on the anti-aging part Since I also want to start taking care of my skin (im only 25) before its to late. I really LOVE this product so please please please would you PLEAsE make or create a new product with the same purpose (as a moisturizer for people like US) with blemish/redness/anti-aging/moisturizer. I will win the lottery if you guys did this!
I cant believe how a face wash can work this well. actually i use 3 products together from the beginning so im not sure which one or if it is all but. they are all total effects. i use the blemish cream cleanser and the night firming cream and the uv protection lotion fragrance free. i love them all. my face is glowing. and seems to also get rid of spots and it looks so creamy. and the feel of it when you put it on! its amazing! and after i wash my face it feels so smooth and soft. most other face washes makes me feel like my face hurts. and when i smile i can feel the lines on my face because it is so dry. please please dont discontinue this! i tried this after regenerist, definity, and pro x came out. i know total effects was first. so im so afraid that you will just replace total effects. please dont. i have tried the regengerist lotion and its too strong the scent. anyway i cant even explain how happy i am with this product. even when im just sitting still i can feel my face! my face has never been more comfortable. olay is the best! thank you so much.
I've been looking for something to help clear my skin and an anti-aging skin care. Well I finally found it and it's called Total Effects Cream Cleanser & Blemish Control. I can't live without it if I could I would sleep with it.(lol) It is a lifesaver I have sensitive skin so since this really works for me I will never try anything else. I have 4 children and I have them using it also. My oldest is 17 and my youngest is 11 and they all love it. I ran out to the store today just to get more I can't run out. I love it so much I have 7 in my pantry. Now that is loyalty and I just want to say thanks for making my life easier.
I've used proactiv for the past ten years, convinced that no other product could perform better. Boy, have I been wrong! I picked up this product recently on a whim, figuring I'd just use it until I could buy more proactiv, and I instantly fell in love. :) I'll never buy anything but this cleanser! It is so ideal! I'm at the age that I need to start considering an anti-aging routine...and I love that this one product can fulfill that need AND treat acne. I am like so many other reviewers concerning this cleanser -- PLEASE do not stop making it! Thanks to this one product, I am a convert..I am sold. My next purchase will be the Total Effects Daily Moisturizer.
Once I turned 30 I started to notice that I was showing signs of aging, that came way too quick for me... So I immediately went out and tried my first anti-aging cream, Olay Total Effects. The next time I needed some there was a sale of Buy one Olay product get one 1/2 off, so I figured "what the heck, I'll try the blemish control cleanser." Boy am I happy I did. This is the first product in my life that actually cleared my skin, maintains my tone and doesn't make me feel all dried out. I absolutely love this stuff. I actually told my 16 year old daughter that she should try it for her breakouts as well, and she has been excstatic that her face has finally cleared up and hey you're never too young to start the anti-aging process, right!?!?!? I really hope they don't discontinue this product, it will literally break my heart. I wish I had discovered this product sooner! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED, especially to those women that have tried almost everything for their blemishes, including ProActive and visits to the dermatologist!
I was skeptical about this product because some times i have a reaction with certain products. I was a biore user until i ran out and couldn't find it anywhere so my husband said you use olay moisturizer try this out.So I picked it up at nearest drugstore so i tried and i would say within a week or 2 i noticed my skintone becoming more and more even, my lines were al ot smoother,I don't have a lot of lines but this did the trick. I hope they don't discontinue this!!
I love this cleanser. My favorite lotion, the active hydrating sensitive cream has been discontinued, and so has the total effects anti blemish lotion. I don't know if this will be kept or discontinued like the others. Please don't discontinue this. It is not irritating or overdrying and works really well. I love this, please don't stop making it.
This cleanser has been wonderful for my skin! I was going to the spa/salon to buy Aveda products that weren't even really working. I will use this product form now on and I would highly recommend to the 30 somethings that are starting to show signs of aging and/or have breakouts! I am going to build a whole Olay routine, including face and body! Love it!
After many years using another product, I was fearful of change. My skin is sensitive and prone to breakout but also at 52, starting to show signs of aging. This product is FABULOUS. It makes my skin soft and smooth and keeps breakouts down. I now use it on my upper chest as well and it is softer and smoother than ever! I am new to Olay products but now wonder why it took me so long!
Since having to make the decision to spend my money more wisely in these times, I decided against spending the $50.00 on my RX from the dermotologist and gave this product a chance. I have been using Olay soap for years (love the new vanilla scent) and LOVE this product!!! It does not dry my face out and the smell is yummy! Fights 7 signs of aging and acne in one product!!
I have bought many different skin care products that range from expensive department store brands to over-the-counter affordable skin care. I have tried just about every brand and every kind of product available and I must say that Olay products are amazing! My skin has never looked and felt better. I bought this product to try and I was amazed from the very first use. I will now throw away all of my other products and switch to Olay products only. It's apparent that Olay has done the research and has developed products that actually DO what they advertise!This product is awesome-buy it!
i am a 53 menopausal female,who changes had given me acne for the first time in my life. not only that,but also dark spots. well i tried total effect anti-aging anti-blemish cleanser,just in two weeks my skin improved drastically. even my husband notice. plus i use the total effects mature moister after. i look 20 years younger and my skin is smooth and bright. it is really hard for african american women to find something to even out our skin. i thank you OLAY!!!!!!
I have been suffering from acne for years and now I am getting fine lines and uneven skin tone. This cleanser exfoliates with micro-beads and leaves your skin really clean and fresh without being dry. I can either just use this without anything else (does not overdry), or on really oily days I use the toner afterward, and I always follow with the TE fragrance free lotion. I am so happy I have finally switched to Olay.
Switching from Obagi's Clensiderm system to this was a no-brainer. I love, love, love this cleanser! It leaves my skin feeling soft and not dried out. My breakouts have been minimal since using this cleanser and I'll never switch to another cleanser again.
Great product, reasonable price. Really notice a difference after 1 month of use.Great product, reasonable price. Really notice a difference after 1 month of use.
I am 23 years old and I just want to say that I love this product. It helps with the blemishes that I tend to get once a month and it also leaves my skin smooth and refreshed. I must tell you even though I don't have wrinkles or have any sun spots/age spots, I love the fact that it is Anti-Aging. Alot of people don't know that when you turn 20 your body doesn't make collagen on its own so now is a good time to start with skin replenishing and anti-aging products. I am not saying go crazy but it is time to start really taking care of you skin especially if you are one of those individuals who worry about wrinkles and all the other stuff that happens with your skin because of aging. Also, always follow up with a moisturizer. When applying a moisturizer in the morning make sure it has spf in it to protect your skin during the day. Plus you should definitely wash you face before bed to get all the dirt, toxins and pollutants out of your skin that was built up throughout the day. Moisturize at night as well to place the nutrients and antioxidents back into your skin.
I am starting to show signs of aging but still battling acne. I did a product profile through the Olay site and this wash was recommended. I have been using this product for 2 weeks now and have seen an AMAZING difference in my skin. This product targets both of my issues and am going to start using the Total Effects moisturizers as well.
I have oily, acne prone, and uneven skin. I started using this product one month ago, and now my acne is under control, and the clarity of my skin has improved. I used to use an expensive, and very popular acne product, and felt like it was time to try something new, and more affordable. I'm really glad I made the switch. I am suprisingly pleased and will not try anything else.
This product targets consumers that don't fall into the typical skin categories, i.e.; Oily, Normal, Dry, and Anti-Aging. I am concerned with the aging process of my skin as well as the acne problem I have. This poses a HUGE problem with most products because their anti-aging products only make you break out even worse. This cleanser is awesome! It is the only cleanser I have found to thoroughly cleanse and address oil while not over drying and leaving my skin soft.
It really helped out control my blemishes...doesn't dry out my skin either.It really helped out control my blemishes...doesn't dry out my skin either.

It's easy to let your face go if you don't go anywhere, but, Total Effects draws you in to washing the face. It makes your face feel younger and cleaner than ever before. Somehow the day seems even better after washing, then using the moisturizer. Delightful way to start my day!

It really is for mature skin. Creamy, light and quickly absorbed. Lovely scent that fades. Recommend for all 'M' ladies.It really is for mature skin. Creamy, light and quickly absorbed. Lovely scent that fades. Recommend for all 'M' ladies.
This lotion is so smooth and soaks right into your face. The fragrance is light and very nice. There is no greasy feeling or stickiness which is something I find in other products. I use it at night as there is no SPF in it. This works for me because I love to use Definity Color Recapture for the day.An excellent product and I will purchase it again!
As an Olay Customer for over 30 years this product is great for women who have mature skin. It truly reduces the fine lines of aging and smooths the skin. It is not greasy and blends easily into the skin. I use it on my neck as well and people comment on how young I look. I love the product.
I absolutely love this product. It goes on creamy with no greasy feel, and leaves my skin well moisturized. Living in a high altitude with low humidity really takes its toll; having a product that keeps my skin from feeling dry and taut is really important. This product feels great at night, and is light enough for everyday use. I highly recommend it!
Seriously, if you like a foaming cleanser that makes you look totally beautiful, buy this! It smells wonderful (which really matters to me) feels great while your washing with it, and totally changes the look of your skin. I'm 42 and it transforms pores, redness, uneven skin tone. Try it and you will love it!

This foaming cleansing is superb for Normal to Oily/Combo skin. It removes my make up in a snap and the days oily grime from the face. It also does not leave the skin feeling parched and it smells fresh and clean. I prefer this over the Regenerist and PRO lines of products.
It smells great, removes stubborn eye makeup, and doesn't dry out or irritate my skin. I don't mind the low lather, either, since my skin gets so clean!It smells great, removes stubborn eye makeup, and doesn't dry out or irritate my skin.

This is the best cleanser I have ever used. I'm only 31, so I mainly got it as an acne treatment that would hopefully not dry out my skin like others have. It is a minor miracle worker. All my blackheads are gone, my pores are smaller, and the slight wrinkles near my eyes are less noticeable. It does moisturize without making my skin too oily. Everyones' skin is different, so it might not work for all, but Walmart never asks questions about returns if they don't work as desired. Don't try to save money by conserving - it worked best for me when I used it twice daily. It is worth the extra money. Besides, some people use a cleanser, toner, and moisturizer, but this does all three jobs. I don't write these reviews ever, but I hope someone like me will see this and be helped by it and the product.
Oh MY God, this product is amazing. I'm 21 and I just noticed that I've got smile lines, I also get breakouts before my period. So I started to find something that will improve my facial skin. this one was rated the best in Amazon.com and some other websites, and interestingly with a great price, I mean come on 12 box for 2 packs and not just a tiny pack, a big pack! so I decided to try this one and see if it really works the way people say. AND IT DID. I washed my face only once, after washing my face looked a little red, then I dried it and checked it out a little bit later. OH GOD I was white and clean and shiny! and my friends were asking me what did you do you had so much pimples the other day, I didn't tell them what I did:)) coz it's a secret lolI'm soft and clean, and I enjoy myself in the mirror!I love this, THANKS OLAY
I am in my late twenties and atleast a couple of times a month I'll still get awful breakouts, but when I use this Olay face wash my skin looks and feels great. Plus you get the added bonus of the anti-aging effects! I only wish I could find it in store too. I would definitely recommend!
This has been my favorite cleanser for years and would recommend to anyone. It is creamy, smells nice, has no harsh chemical or drying reaction on my skin. My face is left clean, and smooth. I use topical blemish control (also with salicylic acid) and together, blemishes are under control. Since I am over 50, that is a good thing!Finding the right facial cleanser can be difficult. If they moisturize too much skin gets greasy and cause breakouts. If they "clean" too harshly, they dry out the skin contributing to blemishes and making my face feel tight and pulled. This cleanser has a nice balance leaving my face soft.The product is mild enough that it can be used more than once a day. In our hot Florida summers that is very important. Sometimes I use a small square facial scrub pad with this cleanser to really buff the skin. Again, since the cleanser itself is mild, it does not irritate or cause blemishes.The product size is good, it lasts. Price fits tight budget too. Only downside to this product, usually have to buy this product online. The local stores tend to carry the version without salicylic acid.
I've used this product 2x a day for 5 weeks, now. My skin feels so clean and soft after I wash my face. My face always had little bumps under the skin...zits just waiting to happen. I now have no bumps under my skin. I love this stuff, will continue to use it and recommend it to whoever asks.
I love this product. I was having major breakouts and started to get blemishes from squeezing the pimples on my face. I started using this product and now my blemishes are going away and my face feels so soft and smooth. I use this product twice a day. I would suggest this to anyone suffering from acne and blemishes.
i have tried hundreds of facial cleansers and nothing ever continuously kept my skin clear. this product really works on acne and keeps my face so soft. AND>> the price is right! thank you olay.. do not EVER stop maing this product!i have tried hundreds of facial cleansers and nothing ever continuously kept my skin clear. this product really works on acne and keeps my face so soft.

I have been a faithful user of ProActiv for 11 years. Two months ago, I ran out 3 weeks before my next shipment. I saw Olay Total Effects with Blemish Control and thought I'd try it. What a find! My skin looks and feels amazing. It cleans my skin better than the ProActiv. My skin has never been this clear before. It is amazing! I hope this product never gets discontinued. I've been using Olay products since I was a teenager and never tried this. I am so glad I did!!!

I'm absolutely in love with this stuff. I've tried literally every product on the shelves and nothing was working on my skin. I'm 20 and have been suffering with acne since I was 12. After 2 weeks of using this I've noticed a huge difference in how my skin looks and feels. There's less blemishes, it's glowing, it's just 100% improving. I'm never using anything else ever again.
i would have to rate this product as my #1. i was a lil skeptical at 1st, since i have very DRY skin, and its also SENSITIVE, but due to my stressful job i started to breakout like crazy. (i never did before). when i saw the ingridents in this cleanser I was like .. maybe not. but thn i was sold on the anti-aging part Since I also want to start taking care of my skin (im only 25) before its to late. I really LOVE this product so please please please would you PLEAsE make or create a new product with the same purpose (as a moisturizer for people like US) with blemish/redness/anti-aging/moisturizer. I will win the lottery if you guys did this!
I am 42 and have tried numerous skin care products for my acne prone skin. This cleanser along with the Total effects daily moisturizer (frag-free) has not only helped control my acne but also leaves my skin super soft. I have never been able to say that before! Thank you and please don't ever discontinue these 2 products : ).
I've used proactiv for the past ten years, convinced that no other product could perform better. Boy, have I been wrong! I picked up this product recently on a whim, figuring I'd just use it until I could buy more proactiv, and I instantly fell in love. :) I'll never buy anything but this cleanser! It is so ideal! I'm at the age that I need to start considering an anti-aging routine...and I love that this one product can fulfill that need AND treat acne. I am like so many other reviewers concerning this cleanser -- PLEASE do not stop making it! Thanks to this one product, I am a convert..I am sold. My next purchase will be the Total Effects Daily Moisturizer.
Please do not ever stop making this product. I always had acne as a teen, and now in my 50's I still have the acne.This is the "only" product that helps and makes a difference! Please don't ever stop making this....it's wonderful.Please do not ever stop making this product.

I cant believe how a face wash can work this well. actually i use 3 products together from the beginning so im not sure which one or if it is all but. they are all total effects. i use the blemish cream cleanser and the night firming cream and the uv protection lotion fragrance free. i love them all. my face is glowing. and seems to also get rid of spots and it looks so creamy. and the feel of it when you put it on! its amazing! and after i wash my face it feels so smooth and soft. most other face washes makes me feel like my face hurts. and when i smile i can feel the lines on my face because it is so dry. please please dont discontinue this! i tried this after regenerist, definity, and pro x came out. i know total effects was first. so im so afraid that you will just replace total effects. please dont. i have tried the regengerist lotion and its too strong the scent. anyway i cant even explain how happy i am with this product. even when im just sitting still i can feel my face! my face has never been more comfortable. olay is the best! thank you so much.
I've been looking for something to help clear my skin and an anti-aging skin care. Well I finally found it and it's called Total Effects Cream Cleanser & Blemish Control. I can't live without it if I could I would sleep with it.(lol) It is a lifesaver I have sensitive skin so since this really works for me I will never try anything else. I have 4 children and I have them using it also. My oldest is 17 and my youngest is 11 and they all love it. I ran out to the store today just to get more I can't run out. I love it so much I have 7 in my pantry. Now that is loyalty and I just want to say thanks for making my life easier.
Once I turned 30 I started to notice that I was showing signs of aging, that came way too quick for me... So I immediately went out and tried my first anti-aging cream, Olay Total Effects. The next time I needed some there was a sale of Buy one Olay product get one 1/2 off, so I figured "what the heck, I'll try the blemish control cleanser." Boy am I happy I did. This is the first product in my life that actually cleared my skin, maintains my tone and doesn't make me feel all dried out. I absolutely love this stuff. I actually told my 16 year old daughter that she should try it for her breakouts as well, and she has been excstatic that her face has finally cleared up and hey you're never too young to start the anti-aging process, right!?!?!? I really hope they don't discontinue this product, it will literally break my heart. I wish I had discovered this product sooner! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED, especially to those women that have tried almost everything for their blemishes, including ProActive and visits to the dermatologist!
I was skeptical about this product because some times i have a reaction with certain products. I was a biore user until i ran out and couldn't find it anywhere so my husband said you use olay moisturizer try this out.So I picked it up at nearest drugstore so i tried and i would say within a week or 2 i noticed my skintone becoming more and more even, my lines were al ot smoother,I don't have a lot of lines but this did the trick. I hope they don't discontinue this!!
I love this cleanser. My favorite lotion, the active hydrating sensitive cream has been discontinued, and so has the total effects anti blemish lotion. I don't know if this will be kept or discontinued like the others. Please don't discontinue this. It is not irritating or overdrying and works really well. I love this, please don't stop making it.
After many years using another product, I was fearful of change. My skin is sensitive and prone to breakout but also at 52, starting to show signs of aging. This product is FABULOUS. It makes my skin soft and smooth and keeps breakouts down. I now use it on my upper chest as well and it is softer and smoother than ever! I am new to Olay products but now wonder why it took me so long!
Since having to make the decision to spend my money more wisely in these times, I decided against spending the $50.00 on my RX from the dermotologist and gave this product a chance. I have been using Olay soap for years (love the new vanilla scent) and LOVE this product!!! It does not dry my face out and the smell is yummy! Fights 7 signs of aging and acne in one product!!
This cleanser has been wonderful for my skin! I was going to the spa/salon to buy Aveda products that weren't even really working. I will use this product form now on and I would highly recommend to the 30 somethings that are starting to show signs of aging and/or have breakouts! I am going to build a whole Olay routine, including face and body! Love it!
i am a 53 menopausal female,who changes had given me acne for the first time in my life. not only that,but also dark spots. well i tried total effect anti-aging anti-blemish cleanser,just in two weeks my skin improved drastically. even my husband notice. plus i use the total effects mature moister after. i look 20 years younger and my skin is smooth and bright. it is really hard for african american women to find something to even out our skin. i thank you OLAY!!!!!!
I have been suffering from acne for years and now I am getting fine lines and uneven skin tone. This cleanser exfoliates with micro-beads and leaves your skin really clean and fresh without being dry. I can either just use this without anything else (does not overdry), or on really oily days I use the toner afterward, and I always follow with the TE fragrance free lotion. I am so happy I have finally switched to Olay.
I have bought many different skin care products that range from expensive department store brands to over-the-counter affordable skin care. I have tried just about every brand and every kind of product available and I must say that Olay products are amazing! My skin has never looked and felt better. I bought this product to try and I was amazed from the very first use. I will now throw away all of my other products and switch to Olay products only. It's apparent that Olay has done the research and has developed products that actually DO what they advertise!This product is awesome-buy it!
Great product, reasonable price. Really notice a difference after 1 month of use.Great product, reasonable price. Really notice a difference after 1 month of use.
Switching from Obagi's Clensiderm system to this was a no-brainer. I love, love, love this cleanser! It leaves my skin feeling soft and not dried out. My breakouts have been minimal since using this cleanser and I'll never switch to another cleanser again.
I am 23 years old and I just want to say that I love this product. It helps with the blemishes that I tend to get once a month and it also leaves my skin smooth and refreshed. I must tell you even though I don't have wrinkles or have any sun spots/age spots, I love the fact that it is Anti-Aging. Alot of people don't know that when you turn 20 your body doesn't make collagen on its own so now is a good time to start with skin replenishing and anti-aging products. I am not saying go crazy but it is time to start really taking care of you skin especially if you are one of those individuals who worry about wrinkles and all the other stuff that happens with your skin because of aging. Also, always follow up with a moisturizer. When applying a moisturizer in the morning make sure it has spf in it to protect your skin during the day. Plus you should definitely wash you face before bed to get all the dirt, toxins and pollutants out of your skin that was built up throughout the day. Moisturize at night as well to place the nutrients and antioxidents back into your skin.

I am starting to show signs of aging but still battling acne. I did a product profile through the Olay site and this wash was recommended. I have been using this product for 2 weeks now and have seen an AMAZING difference in my skin. This product targets both of my issues and am going to start using the Total Effects moisturizers as well.
I have oily, acne prone, and uneven skin. I started using this product one month ago, and now my acne is under control, and the clarity of my skin has improved. I used to use an expensive, and very popular acne product, and felt like it was time to try something new, and more affordable. I'm really glad I made the switch. I am suprisingly pleased and will not try anything else.
This facial cleanser is amazing! It was the first OLAY face wash that I had ever used, and now I cannot live without it. My skin is blemish free, wrinkle free, and more evenly toned. Definitely 5 stars!This facial cleanser is amazing! It was the first OLAY face wash that I had ever used, and now I cannot live without it.

This product targets consumers that don't fall into the typical skin categories, i.e.; Oily, Normal, Dry, and Anti-Aging. I am concerned with the aging process of my skin as well as the acne problem I have. This poses a HUGE problem with most products because their anti-aging products only make you break out even worse. This cleanser is awesome! It is the only cleanser I have found to thoroughly cleanse and address oil while not over drying and leaving my skin soft.
It's easy to let your face go if you don't go anywhere, but, Total Effects draws you in to washing the face. It makes your face feel younger and cleaner than ever before. Somehow the day seems even better after washing, then using the moisturizer. Delightful way to start my day!

I couldn't get through a day without these cleansing cloths. I use them daily as part of my Olay regime and I cannot say enough good about how great my skin feels, how easy it is to have good skin, and how often I am told I look like I'm 10 years younger than I am. Super for traveling too - just one nice flat package cleans, exfoliates, treats the skin, and moisturizes. Smells great too!
I have been using the cleansing cloths for about 3 or 4 months, and I find my skin to be smoother and softer.I have been using the cleansing cloths for about 3 or 4 months, and I find my skin to be smoother and softer.
I've been looking for a replacement cleanser for my very sensitive skin ever since Almay discontinued its kinetin skin optimizing cleanser. Every product I tried felt harsh, drying, irritating--even products purported to be hypoallergenic and expressly for sensitive skin. This product is great. It is gentle, non-drying and yet does something--I don't know exactly what--to enhance the appearance of the skin. Please don't discontinue this amazing product!
I really like this cleanser! it helps with my pores, and i love the fact that its anti-aging. im also 30, so i wanted a cleanser that would give me the benefits of an anti-aging product but that also does so much more, and actually take ALL my makeup off! and it does! definitely getting this cleanser again!
I have very dry skin, and after trying many cleansers, this one was the best. The lather was rich and my skin did not feel tight after; it felt moisturized and soft, but clean. Best ever, plus it took off my makeup completely!I have very dry skin, and after trying many cleansers, this one was the best.

This product is a lovely light moisturizer. Color is light and blends with my fair skin well. Does not sit on top of the skin, is not a coverup so even if your skin is darker, this product would work.Someone's review mentioned glitter. I have purchased this a few times and never seen shimmer/glitter in the product. It is designed to be absorbed into the skin not sit on top.I notice that my makeup/coverup products go on smoother when I use this moisturizer and don't look so crepey.The fine lines around my eyes have diminished slowly over time. So has puffiness and darker tones. Feel more confident when I take my glasses off and my eyes are more visible. Don't expect quick results. It is slow but noticeable!Price is a bit high for my budget but a tiny dot goes a long way. Tiny bottle lasts a long time.Been using this product for about three years.Been using Regenerist Anti Aging Eye Roller with it for the last year. LOVE the combination and what they have done for my eye area!

I have not been using this for to long , but so far I am impressed with all it has to offer! I love that a little really goes a long way, It Is very hydrating , & my eye area actually feels firmer & looks brighter! The jar is small, but since it truely only takes a bit I feel this will last around 4 months using 2x a day, or even 6+ months If used once a day! All In all I feel this Is a very nice eye cream especially compared to high end eye creams I have tried. This one does what it says & who doesnt love saving money!!? If your on the fence with this one you really should give it a try, It's worth it :)
I have been using the Regenerist eye cream and it softens deep wrinkles and really does refresh this tender dry skin!I have been using the Regenerist eye cream and it softens deep wrinkles and really does refresh this tender dry skin!
I have an old scar from when I was 8 on my forehead, in useing Total Effects Eye Transforming Cream I have noticed the scar is lessened. It is wonderful for the puffiness around my eyes that I tend to get from allergies, too! My Grandmother used Oil of Olay and now I use only Olay Products!
I just bought this and I love it already!! It controls the shine I get in my T-zone especially during humid weather and does not dry out the rest of my face. Love the smell too!! I like to wash my face with an oil-free cleanser in the morning before moisturizing and make-up, or my face can get too oily during the day and this is perfect for the job. Thanks Olay for another great product.
I LOVE this product, it is very refreshing and I hope that it is around for a long time! It has just the right amount and size of exfoliating beads and it feels awesome:) I tried a different scrub that felt really abrasive, but this one is great. Also, my face feels neither oily or dry with it.

This is the only moisturizer that doesn't break me out! I LOVE IT! I have been using it every day for over a year now. Its great that there's an SPF in it as well because it gives me added protection from the sun throughout the day. I won't use anything else!

I have used this sensitive skin zinc oxide lotion for as long as I can remember, so has my mom. It's lightly moisturizing, perfect for my combo/acne-prone skin, and keeps my skin clear of uv damage. I burn VERY easily and this daily lotion prevents that. There is no scent, no oil, does not aggravate my acne-prone skin, or break me out, simply perfect :)

Olay complete UV moisturizer (SPF 15) sensitive skin OIL FREE!!!!Yay! such a product exists...soo inconvienent/expensive to continue with the kiosk/mail order brand- proactiv(oil free spf moisturizer)i've relied on...NOW i can use this product that goes on light/non-greasy and has the same oil free /spf 15 i've grown accustomed to to stay young looking and to keep a clear complextion!!! having a clear complextion and "protected" skin is the most important things...so a hydrator that doesn't clog my pores is the goal!!!i'm trying this today since i discovered it at my cousin's house...and if it clogs my skin...you'll hear from me later. So far I really like it!!! :) I'm soo excited. i also use the jar of regenerist microsculpting cream on my neck/top of hands at night. used to use the facewash in the pump a long time ago. If this moisturizer doesn't make me break out I'll be switching over to olay for all my facial product needs :) yay!!! i'm free from the $$$ bondage of that other brand & my skin feels great with this moisturizer. Thank you!!!! however you got to this point with this formulation....I'm happy!
I am so glad I was able to find the new "Classic" Olay SPF for sensitive skin. I wish I had known about it sooner. Chemical SPFs irritate my sensitive skin as does niacinamide...Making it very difficult to find something that works for me. Well this definitely does. I now use this every morning, and it really is helping to even my complexion and clear up my acne. I use this in the morning after washing my face with the "Olay Sensitive Skin Foaming Face Wash" (at night I follow the foaming face wash with the "Olay Night of Olay Firming Cream"~another product I love, mixed with a couple drops of jojoba oil). As long as Olay continues to make these products, I will continue to buy them. This lotion goes on so smooth and absorbs nicely. My skin doesn't feel greasy or tight after using this, zero irritation...I'm left with a healthy dewy glow to my skin. I don't even find I have to apply makeup over this. Did I mention how reasonably priced and readily available this is?I've had people tell me how much better my skin has been looking lately, I attribute it to Olay (since it is the only thing I've changed). I could go on and on about how terrific this product is.
I am so glad I tried this moisturizer w/ SPF! It's just what I was looking for to complete my daily face regimen, it is perfect for my fair, sensitive skin - it's moisturizing enough to wear on it's own (without layering with another moisturizer) - and I love that it has zinc in it. I wear it everyday! Thanks again, Olay!
Thank you, Olay, for hearing your customers and bringing back the "Classic Gentle Formula." I'm so happy to know I can now continue to use the product that I've loved for so many years.Thank you, Olay, for hearing your customers and bringing back the "Classic Gentle Formula."

I found the "new old" product. Yippee! The box has the familiar yellow, white and black graphics with a green band at the bottom that says light, non-greasy lotion--FRAGRANCE FREE; and the same green color oval on the top left of the package that says "Classic Gentle Formula". Many thanks P&G--a belated but still appreciated return of my beloved zinc oxide formula!
I have been using this product for many years. I am in my 60's and out in the sun a lot. I love that it is light, non-greasy and is absorbed quickly. My skin feels and looks great, and I find the sun protection is very reliable. I would recommend this product to anyone who wants their skin to look and feel great, and still stay within their budget.

I don't often write reviews but after reading some of the negative reviews I had to put in my positive one. I love this moisturizer! I've been using mostly Olay for several years and was using the more expensive versions for a while. However, I find that this moisturizer does as good a job for my skin type as the more expensive. And the sun protection is outstanding for me. I put it on in the morning and even if I'm out in the sun for an extended period at any time of day, I do not get red or burn at all. I've started using it on my sons (ages 3 and 6) and it works just as great for them. I've been telling all my family about it and many have started using it and love it as well.
I have tried a lot of expensive products and it doesn't work on my skin and caused me to break out. I changed to this product, and it's perfect. I used the old version before too and I think both of them are perfect. Now I ONLY TRUST Olay products from facial wash to lotion and cream. Thank you for bring us all the excellent products. Please keep up the good work!!!
This is better than the old version, it hydrates better and I like it because it is fragrance free, the old stuff drird out my skin and i had to return. Please don't discontinue.This is better than the old version, it hydrates better and I like it because it is fragrance free, the old stuff drird out my skin and i had to return.

Five stars to Olay for caring about their customer's concerns! I was really disappointed when the reformulated version of this didn't work for me. It seemed like a nice change in writing. But sometimes the tried and true products work the best! I've been using Olay moisturizer since my mom introduced it to me when I was twelve (18 years ago!) and loved Complete for Sensitive Skin for many of those years. The new formula didn't cause any allergic reactions, it just wasn't as comfortable to wear as the original. I didn't like the scent either. My skin seemed more oily throughout the day too. So I'm extremely happy to see Olay bring back the original! Kudos Olay!
Olay say "Non-Comedogenic" and means it. I get moisturizing, sun protection, and facial nourishment without any clogging of pores. Easy to apply. Nice. Light.Olay say "Non-Comedogenic" and means it.

This is a great moisturizer for sensitive skin. It moisturizes without being greasy and the added benefit is it contains sunscreen.

I have used Olay moisturizer for almost 30 years and switched to the sensitive skin formula when i first noticed it at my store. I like the SPF 15 so I get some protection every tiem I am outside. My face feels softer and smoother and I have had younger women comment on how my skin does not look my age.
I wouldn't use anything else. The skin on my face and neck are so sensitive that most products immediately begin stinging me as soon as applied. Not yours!I wouldn't use anything else.

I've used Olay moisturizer before in years past. Just recently I found the sensitive product on an acne website recommendation. It's a part of my acne regimen I use and it works. The benzoyl peroxide I use twice daily dries your skin out and the Olay Complete for Sensitive skin works GREAT to rehydrate my skin and protects my face from sun damage too---wonderful product.
I have been using the sensitive skin OlayComplete for about 6-7 years. I like how quickly it absorbs into my skin without feeling greasy. I use it on my face, neck and ears. then I put on my foundation. I appreciate that it has SPF 15 and my foundation has SPF also. I am well protected from the damaging effects from the sun. I also very much appreciate the economical price! Thanks Olay for a great product.
I have used this product for years and LOVE it!! As I got older its kept my face soft and the fine lines aren't so noticeable. I am going to try the Touch of Sun this summer, know it will be great!!

I apply this every morning before I go outside and have been using some form of this lotion for 30 years. I've been using the SPF 15 for sensitive skin ever since I found it in the stores. I hike a lot and get out in the sun, so I need the protection and am often told that I look very healthy for my age.

I couldn't get through a day without these cleansing cloths. I use them daily as part of my Olay regime and I cannot say enough good about how great my skin feels, how easy it is to have good skin, and how often I am told I look like I'm 10 years younger than I am. Super for traveling too - just one nice flat package cleans, exfoliates, treats the skin, and moisturizes. Smells great too!

I've been buying these for years and I love the smell. they don't over power the scent of Tide, instead they compliment it. Sometimes I put 1 in a drawer to keep the clothes smelling good.I've been buying these for years and I love the smell. they don't over power the scent of Tide, instead they compliment it.

I don't like using dryer sheets but had to do something because the static on my clothes is out of control. Having to remember to get the rinse cycle for liquid softener is a pain, so this really helps. I just bought mine & have run three loads with it, very happy. Wish it was cheaper or given away free with a bottle of softener or something.
Wonderful! I remember having one years ago. I know it will save on my water bill too. Got one for my daughter and she really likes it too.Wonderful! I remember having one years ago. I know it will save on my water bill too. Got one for my daughter and she really likes it too.
This is an awesome value. The price and size are unbelievable. People have to remember that this is a concentrated product and that you must use less to obtain the desired results. If you follow the recommended application, you will find that wonderful April Fresh scent that is long lasting. I love this product.
Great Price. Works wonderfullly. Would recommend to everyone who has problems finding Downy Ultra in rural areas.Great Price. Works wonderfullly. Would recommend to everyone who has problems finding Downy Ultra in rural areas.
This is the best fabric softener ever made. Not only does it smell AMAZING but it leaves your clothes soft. Only kind i use, it makes my house smell good the scent never leaves my clothes! I washed my kids summer clothes and packed them away for the winter and when i brought them back out they still smelled good =)
WOW! I never had doughts about this fabric softner made by Downy... The price is great and the value is incredible... I personally rather get the refill, so that I don't have to keep buying the bottles over and over... I strongly recommend it.WOW! I never had doughts about this fabric softner made by Downy...

I decided to try Tide after using an off brand for about a year. The other detergent I was using I had to buy at least once a month if not more often because I was using so much just to get my clothes clean. I tried Tide and I love it! I don't have to use as much toget my clothes clean, they smell great, and I don't have to buy detergent every month! Great Clothes and Savings, I love it!
what more can I say, the title says it! Original april fresh scent!!!!what more can I say, the title says it! Original april fresh scent!!!!

How can anyone rate this any less than 5 stars? Downy softener does what it says it will do and what I want it to do: a) it softens all my laundry; b) it removes any/all static cling; c) it leaves my laundry smelling lovely; d) it makes clothing much easier to iron; e) the fragrance lasts longer than other fabric softeners' fragrances (are there any others that even LEAVE a fragrance?). Because I get all ^ that every single time I use Downy, I realize it is a fabulous bargain. One cap full does the job each and every time; I'm never disappointed. THAT is all the reason anyone needs to achieve a 5 star rating, no?
In the economical downturn my daughter thought she could not afford Downey but missed its softness and delightful smell for her laundry so I bought it for her for Mothers Day. She loves it and has loved it all her life!!In the economical downturn my daughter thought she could not afford Downey but missed its softness and delightful smell for her laundry so I bought it for her for Mothers Day.

Out of all the Step Up movies this one is by far the best. It focuses more on dance battles, rather than the others. Yet you still have romance between Luke and Natalie. They manage to bring some characters from the second movie back. They add some twist though, good ones. They actually have a dance movie that has enough dance in it to be considered 'a dance movie'. Not that the others didn't , I just feel there is a little more dancing. It doesn't matter if it is in 3D or 2D, this movie is awesome either way. Buy it, watch it, re watch it, its worth it.(hideÂ fullÂ review)Out of all the Step Up movies this one is by far the best. It focuses more on dance battles, rather than the others.
