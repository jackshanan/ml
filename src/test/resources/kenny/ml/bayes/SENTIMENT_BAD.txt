Worlds Smallest  in the Guinnes books. Absolutley a dump and people suck!
Do not ever buy things you may have to return. The wait at the customer service counter is forever.

Not enough lines open!! 8-10 people in each of the 4 lanes open.
Electronics suck! Everything is very limited and pricey.
They have poopy Gatorade flavors.

 Don't come here and expect more than 3 registers open!
 Freaking  is a dump!!
 Don't Bother
 Very Sketchy
 Very Sketchy
 This management is the worst!
 The checkout here is the worse of any . The assistant manager and some other front end manager are too busy flirting with the ladies at the bank to be of ANY use. Avoid this  !!!!!
 Never again. This place is straight ghetto.
 They lock the stupid door by the pharmacy side at 10pm mon thru thurs. If youre there late, dont park on that side!
 My drivers side mirror was ripped off of my car in broad daylight in the parking lot at 12:30 pm by a guy who was missing a side mirror on his car ( Ford Focus) same year as mine. Dangerous place
 It's freakin ! I son't expect nothing so I am never disappointed when I go there
 Terrible!! This sucks soooooo bad. Go to
 Terrible!! This wsucks soooooo bad. Go to
 Worst store ever in regards to customer service
 Very, very, very busy 1 week prior to the fall semesters...
 Like 18 registers only 3 are used... Ughhhh
 The trashiest place around
 Dirtiest  I've ever seen. Looks like a mini tornado hit the store. Stuff thrown on any random shelf, clothes all over the floors. Didn't bother going into the food section.
 Waited in line for 20min to be checked out. Literally. 36 lanes and only 4 are open! Seriously?! But hey, that's like every 
 It seems like everyone who works here doesn't have a clue what they're doing.
 It takes 5 days to pick up prints! Omg!!
 So there are no longer scanners throughout the store??? Stupid stupid stupid idea. If they would just price the product correctly then ok with taking the scanners away but nooooo it's not
 Only two registers open after 11pm.
 Compared to other ... this one sucks.
 Never seems to be enough cashiers working. Takes forever to check out!
 Worst run  I have ever been in. shop elsewhere.
 This place is mad ghetto. You have to by your  in a line because they don't allow them on the shelf due to theft...
 Try not to touch any poor people.
 Women's bathroom is straight up nasty!
is Satan is Satan!
This place is the armpit of the retail world. Spend $0.50 more and go to a business that isn't killing private industry. DO NOT ENTER
don't fucking go there unless u absolutely have too!!!!
Fucking Shitiots can't even tell you how much a fucking tire costs until they put it on your car.
The customers are awful! Horribly rude. The employees have a tough job fo sho!
NEVER get keys here. They have no idea how to work the machine. Go to
Make sure you don't ask for anything special at the ...totally unhelpful...
This , just like any other, has horribly long lines. They have over 40 registers but there's never more than 10 open.
This is my least favorite . When I stop here its because its the last resort.
where you can find anything you want except clean bathrooms.
This store is toxic. Terrible service and not so low prices.
Don't come here if your in a hurry!!!! Or with anything frozen !!!!
Out of two bathrooms and 14 stalls you'll be lucky to find the clean one!
Lines are incredibly long as well as the wait time.
service sucks!
Never come here if you need something quick. You will be on line forever.
OMG...it aways takes 20 minutes to check out!
nasty store is hal-full of cheap, Chinese-made junk, bizarre, half-wit customers and thieves plus s l o w. employees and ineffective managers
This ones a bit ghetto and not easy to navigate
Full of rednecks, and weird "trashy" people. Go to .
I'm not really a fan of  but this one is by far the worst I've been to... Worst customer service I've ever seen. Just go to.
Need better customer service
Don't buy produce from here. Watermelon was rotten when I cut it open.
Don't even bother! Go to Los Coches instead. The service is awful every time. Every employee I encountered was just cranky, including the greeter as I was walking out.
"Let's have 30 check out lanes, and only keep 3 open at all times."
Don't come here unless you have time to wait in line
This place is awful.
don't spend your money here
Never come here for a oil change it takes 2 fucken hours >:(
 sucks! They like to skip customers! They like to make people wait longer than they've already been waiting...
Ahh I need a shower, lol so dirty
Horrible service again. Cashier rude, made mistakes, I had to wait in the cust service line to get my bill corrected AGAIN. 45 min check out and the cashier put some of groceries loose in my cart.
This is the  I had my phone stolen keep on driving
Worst oil change ever... Took two hours with one car in front of me, got oil all over the inside of my car, yikes!
Lines are ridiculous for a place with over 22 check-outs
So hot in here. No running water in family bathroom.
where there are 200 employees and 10 of them are working a cash register
7th Level of Hell. Go to
Stay away after 10 you will get worse service than during the day
Don't expect service with a smile - how can someone be miserable and 'Happy to Help'?
Im sorry but i no longer like  because they are a bitch about coupons
because I have never seen such incompetence as I have from the employees at go to
Recently, after 11pm lines are extremely long and they do not open any more registers. Don't waste you time and go during the day.
8 registers and 8 self check outs and everything is closed except one register manned by the crypt keeper and a line that won't quit!!! Grrr
Not the safest place after dark...turns into a thug hang out. Saw a black woman bash another black woman's head into a cash register.
Come with lots of patience
Slowest cashiers I've ever seen in my life, all decrepit old bitches

It's nice to stand around for 20 mins waiting for someone to help out.
This place is slow and don't know how to do their job. I had to tell the lady how to do something, bc she didn't know how... Yet, she still didn't Believe me til she messed up.

It reeks of rotten fish near the entrance of this location.
This place is a disaster zone. The people who shop here yeah this place.
The cafe is gone, just a Starbucks now. No more popcorn :(
The pharmacy closes between 130-2 and it's really inconvenient.
So expensive...

 Not always the most friendly staff. Always seem to be restocking!!
 This is the most disgusting  i have ever been in and it smells like pee.
 Hey management, how about enough cashiers to handle your customer flow..........maybe once or twice a year!
Service at this store went downhill fast. Management team is NOT customer friendly. No wonder they are closing this place.
