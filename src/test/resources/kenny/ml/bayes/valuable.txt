Tan is actually the color the normal  Hogwarts sets come in, so I guess it's not to far of a stretch to follow the same color scheme.

this game hurts my soul So now I have all three 1999  games going on. And boy, what a trainwreck this third one is.

 City Undercover is one of the best games ever. It's so much fun.

Most creative, expansive game ever. Although 1) they could be classified as semi-precious stones are they so expensive, and 2) they also got a bit more complex, while nothing NOTHING beats a BUCKET of yellow blocks. Nice and simple, with ENDLESS possibilities. So much fun.

Put the A-wing together. It is a very sweetly-constructed model. My only problems with it were sticker-related (a couple of stickers had color irregularities, and the cockpit stickers don't really have a good guideline to center up on.) The best part?

 Batman is one popular game on ps3 and xbox having it on iPhone will surely help warner brother's get more fans and help them make more money. Even the price of 5$ sounds reasonable.

Jabba's Palace (and the Rancor Pit to complete the set) is a great set. Lots of good figs, and it makes a nice little display. I also got the Desert Skiff, and intend to get the Sail Barge when it comes out to complete the Tatooine experience.
