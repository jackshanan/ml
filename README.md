ML
=======

Collection of all my Machine Learning libraries in one repository.

This is a work-in-action as many of the libraries were written years ago.
The goal will be to refactor and unify common classes as well as provide more documentation

Supports:

- Bayesian filters
- Clustering algorithms
- Markov Chains
- NLP (very limited)
- Back-Error Propagation NN
- Restricted Boltzmann Machine (single, deep, convoluted, multi-threaded)
- Self-Organizing Map
- Support Vector Machine
- Prefix-Trie

TODO:

- add genetic programming libs
- add dynamic programming libs
